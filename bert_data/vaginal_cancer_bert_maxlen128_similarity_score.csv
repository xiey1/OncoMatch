A report of the first case of the unlikely occurrence of both of these developments in the same patient is presented. A 34-year-old nulligravid Philippine woman with a history of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome presented with a 5-month history of bleeding from a blind vaginal pouch. Vaginal biopsy identified a moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Exploratory laparotomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and iliac lymph node samplings, and excision of a mullerian remnant were performed with no evidence of disease. A FIGO Stage I vaginal cancer was assigned and pelvic irradiation was given. Disease recurred 4 months later and the patient underwent total pelvic exenteration. More than 1 year since the exenteration procedure, she is without evidence of disease. This is the first reported case of a primary vaginal cancer in a patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.

Recurrent cervical cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2002-04-01,"There are limited treatment options for patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. Because of low response rates and a negligible impact on long-term survival, the use of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable recurrent disease should be considered palliative. Generally, radiation therapy in previously irradiated patients is considered palliative. For patients who develop recurrent disease after definitive surgery who have not received prior radiation therapy, salvage radiation therapy is the treatment of choice. Similarly, patients who have received definitive primary radiation therapy are candidates for surgical resection of their recurrence. However, there are specific criteria for surgical resection. Radical hysterectomy may be an option for the very rare patient with a small (<2 cm) centrally located recurrence in the cervix or vaginal fornices. However, for most patients, pelvic exenteration remains the only therapeutic option that offers the possibility of long-term survival. Patients who are candidates for exenteration are those with central local recurrences that have not extended to the pelvic sidewalls. The introduction of high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy (HDR-IORT) combined with radical surgical resection has widened the scope of patients who may be offered surgery. Patients who in the past may not have been surgical candidates may benefit from radical surgical resection combined with HDR-IORT. All patients who are surgically fit and have undergone previous radiation therapy should be considered for surgical resection for centrally located recurrences. Patients whose recurrences extend close to the pelvic sidewalls should be referred to centers where HDR-IORT is available.",Journal Article,6504.0,40.0,limited treatment options patients recurrent cervical carcinoma low response rates negligible impact long-term survival use chemotherapy patients unresectable recurrent disease considered palliative Generally radiation therapy previously irradiated patients considered palliative patients develop recurrent disease definitive surgery received prior radiation therapy salvage radiation therapy treatment choice Similarly patients received definitive primary radiation therapy candidates surgical resection recurrence specific criteria surgical resection Radical hysterectomy option rare patient small 2 cm centrally located recurrence cervix vaginal fornices patients pelvic exenteration remains therapeutic option offers possibility long-term survival Patients candidates exenteration central local recurrences extended pelvic sidewalls introduction high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy HDR-IORT combined radical surgical resection widened scope patients offered surgery Patients past surgical candidates benefit radical surgical resection combined HDR-IORT patients surgically fit undergone previous radiation therapy considered surgical resection centrally located recurrences Patients recurrences extend close pelvic sidewalls referred centers HDR-IORT available,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[125, 32, 383, 24, 838, 9, 7, 5, 387, 134, 408, 1, 154, 51, 151, 2, 8, 6821, 345, 23, 319, 337, 25, 3, 119, 1, 56, 4, 7, 5, 1468, 387, 34, 257, 40, 515, 994, 1228, 121, 36, 4, 373, 2398, 7, 16, 515, 994, 9, 7, 54, 690, 387, 34, 50, 1057, 152, 54, 47, 44, 103, 324, 121, 36, 992, 121, 36, 16, 3, 24, 1, 1866, 1813, 7, 54, 47, 103, 1057, 86, 121, 36, 32, 1931, 9, 221, 170, 1, 136, 146, 137, 125, 32, 112, 371, 9, 221, 170, 711, 2622, 68, 40, 35, 1501, 9, 3, 923, 622, 69, 5, 8, 302, 18, 494, 4604, 2308, 146, 4, 3, 3629, 15, 52960, 137, 9, 96, 7, 1110, 5668, 469, 3, 158, 189, 1501, 17, 2339, 3, 2526, 1, 319, 337, 25, 7, 54, 32, 1931, 9, 5668, 32, 135, 5, 854, 293, 1593, 17, 47, 44, 1747, 6, 3, 1110, 42959, 3, 2456, 1, 64, 61, 116, 1720, 121, 36, 5309, 4158, 397, 5, 711, 221, 170, 71, 21990, 3, 7924, 1, 7, 54, 68, 40, 2216, 152, 7, 54, 4, 3, 1219, 68, 44, 47, 85, 221, 1931, 68, 247, 29, 711, 221, 170, 397, 5, 5309, 4158, 62, 7, 54, 32, 2350, 2975, 2, 47, 1989, 698, 121, 36, 257, 40, 515, 9, 221, 170, 9, 4604, 2308, 1593, 7, 1310, 1593, 4087, 2336, 6, 3, 1110, 42959, 257, 40, 1995, 6, 1168, 1257, 5309, 4158, 16, 390]",1691.0,12057073,Recurrent cervical,154,0.7738693467336684

Forty women, who were at least 18 years old with persistent biopsy-proven CIN 2 and CIN 3 within the previous 3 months of enrollment, underwent PDT in a phase I and II design. Five escalating radiant energies (increments of 25 J/cm(2), beginning at 50-150 J/cm(2)) using a Coherent Dye Model 920 argon pumped dye laser providing light at 630 nm (maximum output 0.8 W) were used to perform PDT with a fixed dose of ALA (200 mg/ml). ALA was placed in a cervical cap fitted to the cervix. After 90 minutes, the cap was removed and the ectocervix was illuminated for 5-16 minutes, depending on the irradiance. Success was defined as the absence of CIN on Pap smear or colposcopic examination at 12-months. Patients were monitored for toxicity. Thirty-two women (80%) completed the study with 1 year of follow-up. Sixty percent had CIN 3 and 40% CIN 2. Success rates at 4, 8, and 12 months were 51, 46, and 31%, respectively, and were not light-dose dependent. Three patients progressed from CIN 2 to CIN 3. Toxicity was tolerable and only consisted of spotting, vaginal discharge, mild cramping, and vaginal warmth. There was no apparent dose relationship to toxicity.

Sentinel node biopsy in vulvar and vaginal melanoma: presentation of six cases and a literature review.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2002-11-01,"Urogenital melanoma is a rare neoplasm with poor prognosis. Its management in the past involved radical vulvectomy and complete bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an accurate low-morbidity procedure when used in the context of cutaneous melanoma. However, prophylactic lymphadenectomy has not been shown to improve survival of melanoma patients. We wanted to determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with female urogenital melanoma as a staging procedure. Six patients with vulvar or vaginal melanomas underwent preoperative lymphatic mapping with (99m)Tc-labeled sulfur colloid followed by sentinel lymphadenectomy. In addition, we reviewed the literature on the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy in urogenital tract melanomas. One or more sentinel nodes were identified in all six patients by lymphoscintigraphy. All patients underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy, except for one patient with a deep vaginal melanoma that drained to pelvic nodes. The five successful cases had unilateral drainage patterns. None of the sentinel lymph nodes excised had tumor invasion. Combined with five other patients from the published literature, the success rate of localizing sentinel lymph nodes in the patients with urogenital melanoma approaches 100%.

Stage IIIC endometrioid corpus cancer includes distinct subgroups.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2002-10-01,"Because stage IIIC corpus cancer is a heterogeneous substage, the outcomes of patients with stage IIIC disease were assessed according to the extent of extrauterine disease. From 1984 through 1993, 51 patients with surgical stage IIIC corpus cancer were treated at our institution; 5 patients had tumors with nonendometrioid histologic features and were excluded from the analyses. Of the 46 patients with endometrioid carcinoma, 22 had lymph nodes as the only site of extrauterine disease (stage IIIC(0)) and 24 also had peritoneal cytologic, uterine serosal, adnexal, or vaginal involvement or a combination of these (stage IIIC(ab)). The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 18 pelvic and 8 aortic nodes. Median follow-up for surviving patients was 84 months. Patients with stage IIIC(0) cancer had a 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS) of 72% and a 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 68%, and those with stage IIIC(ab) had a CSS of 33% and an RFS of 25% (P < 0.01). Of the 22 patients with stage IIIC(0) endometrioid cancer, 21 had adjuvant radiotherapy (1 also received chemotherapy) and 1 was not treated. Relapse occurred in 7 (32%) patients, with only 1 having an initial failure component outside the node-bearing areas (lung). Of the 24 patients with stage IIIC(ab) cancer, 16 received adjuvant radiotherapy (1 had concomitant chemotherapy), 2 had chemotherapy, 4 had hormonal therapy, and 2 were not treated.

Medical records of 24 patients with VAIN II or III, treated by CO(2) laser ablation from 1990 to 1998 were reviewed. The grade, location, and focality of the lesions, the age, follow-up period and menopausal status of the patients, the power and duration of laser ablation, the presence of concurrent cervical or vulvar neoplasia or previous hysterectomy were evaluated as possible prognostic factors. Ablations of the VAIN were successfully accomplished in all of the patients with a mean period of 25.2+10.2 min, including additional simultaneous ablations of the cervix or vulva in eight (33.3%) patients. There was no early or late major complication. VAIN was completely eliminated in 17 (70.8%) patients after the first and in 19 (79.2%) patients after multiple episodes of ablation with a mean follow-up of 26.7+19.6 months. VAIN progressed to invasive vaginal carcinoma in one woman. None of the evaluated prognostic factors was found to be related to the persistence or recurrence.

Estrogen deprivation symptoms, particularly vaginal dryness (35.2%) and dyspareunia (27.7%), were commonly bothersome. Genital symptoms resulting in sexual dysfunction were the most significant predictors of satisfaction with surgery. The prevalence of depression (20.4%) was similar to that of the general population, but a significant proportion of the group (20.7%) continued to report significant ovarian cancer-specific worries despite surgery. Vaginal symptoms are bothersome to women who have undergone RRSO, but overall health and psychological outcomes are not impaired.

The use of MRI in the diagnosis and management of a bulky cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-06-01,"In the treatment of gynecologic cancer, surgical planning depends on the site and extent of disease. The evaluation of the origin of a large pelvic mass with combined pelvic examination and ultrasound is often adequate. However, the following case report illustrates the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when sonographic findings are indeterminate and the origin of a pelvic mass is unclear. A 73-year-old woman presented for her first gynecologic exam in over 40 years. On speculum examination the cervix was not visible. A large, mobile pelvic mass was palpated during physical examination. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a large, cystic pelvic mass thought to be ovarian in origin. Surgery for presumed ovarian carcinoma was planned. Because a vaginal Pap smear revealed squamous-cell carcinoma, MRI was performed for further evaluation. MRI demonstrated a blood distended uterus with a large cervical tumor obstructing the endocervical os. After cervical dilatation under sonographic guidance, evacuation of the hematometrium was performed. Multiple biopsies of the cervix confirmed the diagnosis of a bulky Stage IIA squamous-cell carcinoma of the cervix.

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of women with sarcomatoid carcinoma of the cervix identified by query of the Snomed pathologic diagnostic retrieval system and by direct physician query. Data were extracted from available charts, and pathology review was performed on all cases. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Nine of 12 identified patients had complete clinical information and pathologic material available. The mean age at diagnosis was 48 (range, 29-76) years. Stage at diagnosis was I (4 patients), II (2 patients), and IV (3 patients). Patients younger than 40 years of age presented with stage I disease. All patients had visible tumor; 8 of 9 had vaginal bleeding or discharge at presentation. Microscopic evaluation revealed areas of spindle-cell sarcomatous tumor confluent with areas of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated coexpression of cytokeratin and vimentin in tumor cells. Tumors with a prominent spindle-cell component also expressed smooth muscle actin. Initial treatment varied, but all patients had a complete response to initial treatment. Five patients recurred with a median disease-free interval of 4.9 (range, 2-9.5) months, and none responded to second-line therapy. Four patients remained disease-free at 5, 18, 30, and 40 months, respectively, after completing initial therapy. Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the cervix is an aggressive neoplasm.

Definitive radiotherapy for patients with isolated vaginal recurrence of endometrial carcinoma after hysterectomy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-08-01,"To determine the outcome of patients after radical radiotherapy (RT) for isolated vaginal recurrence of endometrial carcinoma and to determine the clinical and pathologic predictors of outcome. We reviewed the records of 91 patients treated at our institution between 1960 and 1997 with radical RT for vaginal recurrence after definitive surgery for endometrial carcinoma. Thirty-one percent of the patients received external beam RT (EBRT) alone, 12% received brachytherapy alone, and 57% received a combination. The median dose of radiation was 75 Gy (range 34-122). All end points were measured from the time of the first recurrence. The median duration of follow-up after recurrence was 58 months (range 1-289). The 2- and 5-year local control (LC) rate and overall survival rate was 82% and 75% and 69% and 43%, respectively. The median time from initial diagnosis of endometrial cancer to death from disease was 38 months. On univariate analysis, a dose to the relapse site of > or =80 Gy and EBRT plus brachytherapy vs. single-modality therapy were significant predictors of improved LC. On multivariate analysis, only the type of treatment correlated significantly with LC (p = 0.03). On univariate analysis, Grade 1 or 2 vs. Grade 3 tumor and EBRT plus brachytherapy vs. single-modality therapy were significant predictors of improved overall survival. RT provides excellent LC of isolated vaginal recurrences of endometrial carcinoma, particularly when high doses are given using a combination of EBRT and brachytherapy. However, distant metastases frequently develop despite local disease control, contributing to a 5-year overall survival rate of <50%. For patients who have an isolated vaginal recurrence, the time from initial diagnosis of endometrial cancer to death from disease is usually >3 years. For this reason, in studies of adjuvant RT, long-term follow-up is required to permit evaluation of the impact of treatment on survival.",Journal Article,6017.0,96.0,determine outcome patients radical radiotherapy RT isolated vaginal recurrence endometrial carcinoma determine clinical pathologic predictors outcome reviewed records 91 patients treated institution 1960 1997 radical RT vaginal recurrence definitive surgery endometrial carcinoma Thirty-one percent patients received external beam RT EBRT 12 received brachytherapy 57 received combination median dose radiation 75 Gy range 34-122 end points measured time recurrence median duration follow-up recurrence 58 months range 1-289 2- 5-year local control LC rate overall survival rate 82 75 69 43 respectively median time initial diagnosis endometrial death disease 38 months univariate dose relapse site =80 Gy EBRT plus brachytherapy vs. single-modality therapy significant predictors improved LC multivariate type treatment correlated significantly LC p 0.03 univariate Grade 1 2 vs. Grade 3 EBRT plus brachytherapy vs. single-modality therapy significant predictors improved overall survival RT provides excellent LC isolated vaginal recurrences endometrial carcinoma particularly high doses given combination EBRT brachytherapy distant metastases frequently develop despite local disease control contributing 5-year overall survival rate 50 patients isolated vaginal recurrence time initial diagnosis endometrial death disease usually 3 years reason studies adjuvant RT long-term follow-up required permit evaluation impact treatment survival,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 228, 1, 7, 50, 711, 310, 240, 9, 1355, 146, 1, 134, 2, 6, 223, 3, 38, 2, 510, 674, 1, 228, 21, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 970, 7, 73, 28, 114, 731, 59, 10391, 2, 2341, 5, 711, 240, 9, 146, 50, 1057, 152, 9, 134, 977, 104, 714, 1, 3, 7, 103, 1455, 1345, 240, 1883, 279, 133, 103, 1536, 279, 2, 696, 103, 8, 150, 3, 52, 61, 1, 121, 10, 481, 381, 184, 562, 3285, 62, 396, 862, 11, 644, 29, 3, 98, 1, 3, 157, 146, 3, 52, 654, 1, 166, 126, 50, 146, 10, 717, 53, 184, 14, 9080, 3, 18, 2, 33, 111, 293, 182, 1837, 116, 2, 63, 25, 116, 10, 878, 2, 481, 2, 790, 2, 601, 106, 3, 52, 98, 29, 388, 147, 1, 12, 6, 273, 29, 34, 10, 519, 53, 23, 880, 65, 8, 61, 6, 3, 429, 606, 1, 15, 493, 381, 2, 1883, 349, 1536, 105, 226, 1396, 36, 11, 93, 674, 1, 231, 1837, 23, 331, 65, 158, 3, 267, 1, 24, 438, 97, 5, 1837, 19, 13, 680, 23, 880, 65, 88, 14, 15, 18, 105, 88, 27, 30, 2, 1883, 349, 1536, 105, 226, 1396, 36, 11, 93, 674, 1, 231, 63, 25, 240, 777, 1503, 1837, 1, 1355, 1593, 1, 134, 823, 198, 64, 415, 32, 447, 75, 8, 150, 1, 1883, 2, 1536, 137, 626, 196, 746, 690, 550, 293, 34, 182, 3156, 6, 8, 33, 111, 63, 25, 116, 1, 212, 9, 7, 54, 47, 35, 1355, 146, 3, 98, 29, 388, 147, 1, 12, 6, 273, 29, 34, 16, 2082, 27, 60, 9, 26, 3852, 4, 94, 1, 249, 240, 319, 337, 166, 126, 16, 616, 6, 5634, 451, 1, 3, 345, 1, 24, 23, 25]",1808.0,12873682,Definitive radiotherapy patients isolated vaginal recurrence endometrial carcinoma hysterectomy,2,0.010050251256281407
Patterns of failure after the multimodality treatment of uterine papillary serous carcinoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2003-09-01,"Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive variant of endometrial carcinoma. The majority of patients with clinical Stage I UPSC are found to have extrauterine disease at the time of surgery. Most authors report survival rates of 35-50% for Stage I-II and 0-15% for Stage III and IV UPSC. Surgical treatment as the sole therapy for patients with Stage I-IV UPSC is unacceptable because of high recurrence rates. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both have been added after surgery in an attempt to improve survival. However, the survival benefit to patients from such multimodality therapy remains uncertain. This study analyzes the patterns of failure in patients with FIGO Stages I-IV UPSC treated by multimodality therapy. Forty-two women with FIGO Stages I-IV UPSC who were treated by multimodality therapy were analyzed retrospectively between 1988 and 1998. Data were obtained from tumor registry, hospital, and radiotherapy chart reviews, operative notes, pathology, and chemotherapy flow sheets. All the patients underwent staging laparotomy, peritoneal cytology, total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingo oophorectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling, omentectomy, and cytoreductive surgery, when indicated followed by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Therapy consisted of external beam radiation therapy in 11 patients (26%), systemic chemotherapy in 20 (48%), and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy in 11 (26%). The treatments were not assigned in a randomized fashion. The dose of external beam radiation therapy ranged from 45-50.40 Gy (median 45). Of the 31 patients (74%) who received chemotherapy, 18 received single-agent (58%), whereas 13 received multiagent chemotherapy (42%). Median follow-up for all patients was 19 months (range 4-72). Median follow-up for the surviving patients was 36 months (range 21-72). Their median age was 65 years. Six patients (14%) had Stage I, 8 patients (19%) had Stage II, 10 (24%) had Stage III, and 18 (43%) had Stage IV disease. Twenty-nine patients (69%) had suffered recurrence at the time of last follow-up. The actuarial failure rate at 2 and 5 years was 58% and 67%, respectively. The majority of the patients (19/29) recurred in the abdomen, vagina, or pelvis (66%). Metastases outside the abdomen were much less common as the first site of failure (17%). Twenty-five patients (60%) had died at the time of reporting; the observed survival rate at 2 years and 5 years was 52% and 43%, respectively. Our data suggest that, after multimodality therapy of FIGO Stage I-IV UPSC, most patients developed abdominopelvic (locoregional) failure, and the great majority of the failures occurred in the abdomen, vagina, and pelvis (66%). Abdominopelvic failure as a component of distant failure occurred in an additional 5 patients (17%). Distant failure alone occurred in 17% of the patients.We propose that future studies should combine whole abdominal radiotherapy (WART) with pelvic and vaginal boosts, in addition to chemotherapy for FIGO Stage I-IV UPSC, especially in patients with minimal residual disease, to attempt to improve the dismal prognosis of patients with UPSC.",Journal Article,5986.0,45.0,Uterine papillary serous

Effects of estrogen plus progestin on gynecologic cancers and associated diagnostic procedures: the Women's Health Initiative randomized trial.,JAMA,JAMA,2003-10-01,"The effects of continuous combined hormone therapy on gynecologic cancers have not been investigated previously in a randomized trial setting. To determine the possible associations of estrogen plus progestin on gynecologic cancers and related diagnostic procedures. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 16 608 postmenopausal women, who had not had a hysterectomy at baseline and who had been recruited from 40 US clinical centers between September 1993 and October 1998 (average follow-up, 5.6 years).

Incident invasive cancer of the ovary and endometrium. In 5.6 years of follow-up, there were 32 cases of invasive ovarian cancer, 58 cases of endometrial cancer, 1 case of nonendometrial uterine cancer, 13 cases of cervical cancer, and 7 cases of other gynecologic cancers. The hazard ratio (HR) for invasive ovarian cancer in women assigned to estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-3.24). The HR for endometrial cancer was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.48-1.36). No appreciable differences were found in the distributions of tumor histology, stage, or grade for either cancer site. The incidence of other gynecologic cancers was low and did not differ by randomization assignment. More women taking estrogen plus progestin required endometrial biopsies (33% vs 6%; P<.001). This randomized trial suggests that continuous combined estrogen plus progestin therapy may increase the risk of ovarian cancer while producing endometrial cancer rates similar to placebo. The increased burden of endometrial biopsies required to assess vaginal bleeding further limits the acceptability of this regimen. These data provide additional support for caution in the use of continuous combined hormones.",Clinical Trial,5956.0,438.0,effects continuous combined hormone therapy gynecologic investigated previously randomized trial setting determine possible associations estrogen plus progestin gynecologic related diagnostic procedures Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial 16 608 postmenopausal women hysterectomy baseline recruited 40 clinical centers September 1993 October 1998 average follow-up 5.6 years tablet day containing 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate n 8506 placebo n 8102 Incident invasive ovary endometrium 5.6 years follow-up 32 cases invasive ovarian 58 cases endometrial 1 case nonendometrial uterine 13 cases cervical 7 cases gynecologic hazard ratio HR invasive ovarian women assigned estrogen plus progestin compared placebo 1.58 95 confidence interval CI 0.77-3.24 HR endometrial 0.81 95 CI 0.48-1.36 appreciable differences distributions histology stage grade site incidence gynecologic low differ randomization assignment women taking estrogen plus progestin required endometrial biopsies 33 vs 6 P .001 randomized trial suggests continuous combined estrogen plus progestin therapy increase risk ovarian producing endometrial rates similar placebo increased burden endometrial biopsies required assess vaginal bleeding limits acceptability regimen provide additional support caution use continuous combined hormones,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 176, 1, 1314, 397, 785, 36, 23, 1512, 163, 47, 44, 85, 565, 373, 4, 8, 384, 160, 546, 6, 223, 3, 899, 685, 1, 808, 349, 9370, 23, 1512, 163, 2, 139, 752, 1369, 384, 1627, 3142, 619, 1149, 160, 1, 245, 11768, 1679, 117, 54, 42, 44, 42, 8, 2622, 28, 330, 2, 54, 42, 85, 2619, 29, 327, 843, 38, 1168, 59, 2636, 3343, 2, 2551, 1850, 1011, 166, 126, 33, 49, 60, 104, 6977, 379, 218, 1101, 13, 9629, 81, 1, 3868, 17759, 6293, 349, 18, 33, 81, 1, 18815, 3424, 78, 43374, 15, 619, 78, 43375, 2631, 416, 12, 1, 3, 3631, 2, 4, 33, 49, 60, 1, 166, 126, 125, 11, 531, 140, 1, 416, 12, 717, 140, 1, 12, 14, 473, 1, 53767, 12, 233, 140, 1, 12, 2, 67, 140, 1, 127, 1512, 163, 3, 360, 197, 168, 9, 416, 12, 4, 117, 896, 6, 808, 349, 9370, 72, 5, 619, 10, 14, 717, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 849, 27, 259, 3, 168, 9, 12, 10, 13, 865, 48, 58, 13, 576, 14, 511, 77, 9371, 362, 11, 204, 4, 3, 4477, 1, 30, 784, 82, 15, 88, 9, 361, 12, 606, 3, 287, 1, 127, 1512, 163, 10, 154, 2, 205, 44, 1505, 20, 3644, 4392, 80, 117, 2727, 808, 349, 9370, 616, 1154, 466, 105, 49, 19, 144, 26, 384, 160, 844, 17, 1314, 397, 808, 349, 9370, 36, 68, 344, 3, 43, 1, 12, 369, 3787, 12, 151, 288, 6, 619, 3, 101, 892, 1, 1154, 616, 6, 423, 2294, 195, 3526, 3, 8065, 1, 26, 477, 46, 74, 377, 402, 538, 9, 5526, 4, 3, 119, 1, 1314, 397, 4927]",1721.0,14519708,Effects estrogen plus progestin gynecologic associated diagnostic procedures Women 's Health Initiative randomized trial,0,0.0
A randomized trial of letrozole in postmenopausal women after five years of tamoxifen therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003-10-09,"In hormone-dependent breast cancer, five years of postoperative tamoxifen therapy--but not tamoxifen therapy of longer duration--prolongs disease-free and overall survival. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole, by suppressing estrogen production, might improve the outcome after the discontinuation of tamoxifen therapy. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of five years of letrozole therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who have completed five years of tamoxifen therapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival. A total of 5187 women were enrolled (median follow-up, 2.4 years). At the first interim analysis, there were 207 local or metastatic recurrences of breast cancer or new primary cancers in the contralateral breast--75 in the letrozole group and 132 in the placebo group--with estimated four-year disease-free survival rates of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively, in the two groups (P< or =0.001 for the comparison of disease-free survival). A total of 42 women in the placebo group and 31 women in the letrozole group died (P=0.25 for the comparison of overall survival). Low-grade hot flashes, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia were more frequent in the letrozole group, but vaginal bleeding was less frequent. There were new diagnoses of osteoporosis in 5.8 percent of the women in the letrozole group and 4.5 percent of the women in the placebo group (P=0.07); the rates of fracture were similar. After the first interim analysis, the independent data and safety monitoring committee recommended termination of the trial and prompt communication of the results to the participants.

Role of CT in the management of recurrent ovarian cancer.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2004-02-01,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential role of preoperative CT in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery. Preoperative CT examinations of 36 consecutive patients (age range, 30-75 years; mean age, 55 years) were reviewed retrospectively. Patients had recurrent ovarian cancer and secondary cytoreduction within a mean CT-surgery interval of 22 days (range, 2-69 days). The CT findings recorded were upper abdominal metastases (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis; perihepatic, perisplenic, gastrohepatic or gastrosplenic ligaments; gallbladder fossa; falciform ligament; lesser sac), lymphadenopathy (above or below the renal hilum), liver metastasis, large- and small-bowel obstruction, hydronephrosis, ascites, and the presence of a pelvic mass. CT findings and cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) levels were correlated with surgical resectability. At surgery, tumors in 27 patients were optimally debulked (residual disease of <or= 1 cm) and in nine patients were nonresectable. Using multivariate analysis, hydronephrosis (odds ratio = 19.4, p = 0.03) and invasion of pelvic sidewall (odds ratio = 35.6, p = 0.006) were found to be most indicative of tumor nonresectability. The presence of small-bowel obstruction; nodal or perihepatic liver metastasis; ascites; peritoneal carcinomatosis; bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, or vaginal involvement; or infrarenal paraaortic adenopathy; and the level of CA-125 were not strong indicators of tumor nonresectability.

Data were collected on 232 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, 47% of whom were receiving treatment. Fifty percent of the patients had engaged in sexual activity in the past month. Of those who were sexually active, 47% reported no or little desire, 80% reported problems with vaginal dryness, and 62% reported pain or discomfort during penetration. Of those who were sexually inactive, reasons included no partner (44.1%), lack of interest (38.7%), physical problems making sex difficult (23.4%), and fatigue (10.8%). Partner factors also were identified, including physical problems (16.2%), lack of interest (15.3%), and fatigue (5.4%). A multivariate model was used to predict sexual activity and included demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors as predictors. Women who were married (P <.001), were younger than 56 years (P <.001), were not receiving active treatment (P <.01), had a longer time since original diagnosis (P =.104), and liked the appearance of their bodies (P =.004) were more likely to be sexually active.

Radical hysterectomy followed by tailored postoperative therapy in the treatment of stage IB2 cervical cancer: feasibility and indications for adjuvant therapy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-07-01,"To determine the outcome, complications and likelihood of requiring adjuvant therapy of patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer treated with primary radical hysterectomy and lymph node dissection. Clinical and pathologic data between 1985 and 1999 were reviewed. Associations between clinical and pathologic variables were tested using the Fisher's exact test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with significance being calculated using the Log Rank test. Six hundred radical hysterectomies were performed during the study period. Fifty-eight of these women (9.6% of all radical hysterectomies) were diagnosed with FIGO stage IB2 cancers. Sixteen patients (28%) had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Forty-six patients (79%) had invasion involving the outer 1/3 of the cervical stroma, six had positive vaginal margins while five had occult parametrial extension. After retrospective review of the histopathologic data from this case series, criteria from two recently published prospective multicenter Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) trials were applied to this data set. According to criteria established by GOG protocol 92, 30 (52%) patients should have theoretically received adjuvant pelvic radiation while 21 (36%) would have qualified for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation according to the results of GOG protocol 109. In actual fact, only 35 patients (60%) received adjuvant radiotherapy and one received adjuvant chemo-radiation. Severe toxicity was unusual with two developing urinary fistulae and one having a pulmonary embolism. Despite the lack of adjuvant therapy in most cases, only 21 women (38%) recurred of whom 11 failed on the pelvic wall, with an estimated 5-year survival of 62.1%. Radical hysterectomy and tailored adjuvant radiation therapy in stage IB2 cervical cancer is feasible. Even without the liberal use of adjuvant therapy, survival in this high-risk group compares favorably to primary chemotherapy and radiation. According to recently published randomized clinical trials, most patients should receive adjuvant postoperative therapy.

The purpose of this study was to characterize patients diagnosed with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary with an emphasis on risk factors. Between 1989 and 2002, 84 patients with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary were identified. Patients with uterine papillary serous carcinoma were excluded. Clinical and pathologic information was obtained from medical records. Parametric methods were used to compare clinical and pathologic features. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed and compared using the log rank test. Median age at diagnosis was 50 years. Median body mass index (BMI) was 28 kg/m(2). Fifty-one percent (43/84) of the women were premenopausal and 33% (28/84) were nulliparous. The most common presenting symptom was abnormal vaginal bleeding; in those women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, 69% had stage I ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer was an incidental finding in 48% of these patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients (57/84) had endometrioid histology of both their endometrial and ovarian cancers. Patients with early stage ovarian cancer tended to have a more favorable prognosis than those with advanced stage disease (median survival not reached in stage I and II versus 66 months in stage III and IV, P = 0.06). Patients with concordant endometrioid histology had a favorable prognosis (median survival 119 versus 48 months in all other groups, P = 0.02). In this large series of patients, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary were young, obese, nulliparous, and premenopausal. Patients with concordant endometrioid tumors of the endometrium and ovary had a favorable prognosis, with median survival approaching 10 years.",Journal Article,5651.0,172.0,Synchronous primary endometrium ovary 10 women ovarian 5 women endometrial purpose characterize patients diagnosed synchronous primary endometrium ovary emphasis risk factors 1989 2002 84 patients synchronous primary endometrium ovary identified Patients uterine papillary serous carcinoma excluded Clinical pathologic information obtained medical records Parametric methods compare clinical pathologic features Kaplan-Meier survival performed compared log rank test Median age diagnosis 50 years Median body mass index BMI 28 kg/m 2 Fifty-one percent 43/84 women premenopausal 33 28/84 nulliparous common presenting symptom abnormal vaginal bleeding women abnormal vaginal bleeding 69 stage ovarian Ovarian incidental finding 48 patients Sixty-eight percent patients 57/84 endometrioid histology endometrial ovarian Patients early stage ovarian tended favorable prognosis advanced stage disease median survival reached stage II versus 66 months stage III IV P 0.06 Patients concordant endometrioid histology favorable prognosis median survival 119 versus 48 months groups P 0.02 large series patients women synchronous primary endometrium ovary young obese nulliparous premenopausal Patients concordant endometrioid endometrium ovary favorable prognosis median survival approaching 10 years,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2734, 86, 163, 1, 3, 2, 3631, 32, 204, 4, 79, 1, 117, 5, 12, 2, 33, 1, 117, 5, 12, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1507, 7, 265, 5, 2734, 86, 163, 1, 3, 2, 3631, 5, 35, 3136, 23, 43, 130, 59, 3965, 2, 1544, 874, 7, 5, 2734, 86, 163, 1, 3, 2, 3631, 11, 108, 7, 5, 1796, 1744, 134, 11, 1800, 38, 2, 510, 487, 10, 683, 29, 484, 1064, 7590, 636, 11, 95, 6, 932, 38, 2, 510, 404, 876, 882, 25, 318, 11, 173, 2, 72, 75, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 52, 89, 28, 147, 10, 212, 60, 52, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 10, 339, 503, 188, 18, 1461, 104, 714, 601, 874, 1, 3, 117, 11, 2710, 2, 466, 339, 874, 11, 9475, 3, 96, 186, 1656, 934, 10, 1668, 2294, 4, 135, 117, 5, 1668, 2294, 790, 42, 82, 70, 12, 12, 10, 35, 4490, 1567, 4, 576, 1, 46, 7, 1746, 659, 714, 1, 7, 696, 874, 42, 3151, 784, 1, 110, 136, 2, 163, 7, 5, 191, 82, 12, 3886, 6, 47, 8, 80, 913, 356, 76, 135, 5, 131, 82, 34, 52, 25, 44, 1300, 4, 82, 70, 2, 215, 185, 700, 53, 4, 82, 316, 2, 478, 19, 13, 1460, 7, 5, 3610, 3151, 784, 42, 8, 913, 356, 52, 25, 4299, 185, 576, 53, 4, 62, 127, 271, 19, 13, 588, 4, 26, 375, 988, 1, 7, 117, 5, 2734, 86, 163, 1, 3, 2, 3631, 11, 1169, 2209, 9475, 2, 2710, 7, 5, 3610, 3151, 57, 1, 3, 2, 3631, 42, 8, 913, 356, 5, 52, 25, 7773, 79, 60]",1674.0,15297188,Synchronous primary endometrium ovary single institution review 84 cases,0,0.0
"A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of TAS-108 in postmenopausal female patients with locally advanced, locally recurrent inoperable, or progressive metastatic breast cancer.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-08-01,"TAS-108 is a novel steroidal anti-estrogen compound that has a strong binding affinity to the estrogen receptor and, in preclinical studies, has antitumor activity against tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and the pharmacokinetics in patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer. TAS-108 was administered orally once daily starting at 40 mg/day, with dose escalations of 60, 80, 120, and 160 mg/day. A minimum of three patients were enrolled in each dose level, and, if no drug-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were seen in the first 14 days, the next cohort of patients was treated at the next level. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained on day 1, 2, 15, and 28 of the first course. A total of 16 patients were enrolled, and most had received six to seven prior therapies. Clinical toxicities included nausea, vomiting, hot flashes, headache, weakness and fatigue; all were grade 1-2. TAS-108 had no effect on endometrial thickness based on trans-vaginal ultrasound evaluation. The average duration of therapy was 17.4 weeks (range, 4-60 weeks). The mean terminal half-life ranged from 8.0 to 10.7 hour in the interval of 12 to 24 hours postdose. The mean C(max) ranged from 2.8 to 21.0 ng/mL and AUC(0-t) from 15.1 to 148.7 ng.h/mL, this showed a linear correlation with the dose. TAS-108 was well tolerated in the doses studied with no maximum tolerated dose.

p16 expression in squamous lesions of the female genital tract.,Journal of molecular histology,J. Mol. Histol.,2004-02-01,"The aim of this study was to examine the role of p16 in the pathogenesis of squamous carcinoma of the gynecologic tract. Squamous carcinoma and carcinoma in situ from the female genital tract were examined for the expression of p16 by paraffin immunohistochemistry. About 74% (40/54) of cases showed p16 expression. By primary site, 77% (23/30) of cervical, 67% (6/9) of vaginal and 85% (11/13) of vulvar primaries expressed p16, but two endometrial primary squamous carcinomas were negative (0/2). In addition, p16 was not identified in non-dysplastic tissue and low grade dysplasia. In cases where there were matched vaginal or vulvar and cervical primaries in a given patient, there was concordant positive p16 expression. It is concluded that p16 is frequently expressed in squamous carcinoma of the cervix, vagina and vulva, but not seen in cases of benign and low grade lesions. It may be a marker of transformation from a low to a high grade lesion. More cases of endometrial primaries need to be studied to see if these evolve by a p16-independent pathway.",Journal Article,5833.0,8.0,aim examine role p16 pathogenesis squamous carcinoma gynecologic tract Squamous carcinoma carcinoma situ female genital tract examined expression p16 paraffin immunohistochemistry 74 40/54 cases showed p16 expression primary site 77 23/30 cervical 67 6/9 vaginal 85 11/13 vulvar primaries expressed p16 endometrial primary squamous carcinomas negative 0/2 addition p16 identified non-dysplastic tissue low grade dysplasia cases matched vaginal vulvar cervical primaries given patient concordant positive p16 expression concluded p16 frequently expressed squamous carcinoma cervix vagina vulva seen cases benign low grade lesions marker transformation low high grade lesion cases endometrial primaries need studied evolve p16-independent pathway,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 200, 1, 1932, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 691, 134, 1, 3, 1512, 1696, 691, 134, 2, 134, 4, 957, 29, 3, 1061, 8226, 1696, 11, 409, 9, 3, 55, 1, 1932, 20, 2487, 888, 545, 794, 327, 667, 1, 140, 224, 1932, 55, 20, 86, 606, 849, 382, 201, 1, 598, 49, 83, 1, 2, 772, 175, 233, 1, 6183, 570, 1932, 84, 100, 86, 691, 826, 11, 199, 13, 18, 4, 352, 1932, 10, 44, 108, 4, 220, 6461, 246, 2, 154, 88, 2253, 4, 140, 1257, 125, 11, 655, 15, 2, 6183, 4, 8, 447, 69, 125, 10, 3610, 109, 1932, 55, 192, 16, 4724, 17, 1932, 16, 746, 570, 4, 691, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 7553, 2, 9263, 84, 44, 527, 4, 140, 1, 1002, 2, 154, 88, 406, 192, 68, 40, 8, 952, 1, 1392, 29, 8, 154, 6, 8, 64, 88, 1180, 80, 140, 1, 6183, 594, 6, 40, 656, 6, 3764, 492, 46, 4800, 20, 8, 1932, 306, 308]",962.0,15328914,p16 expression squamous lesions female genital tract,0,0.0

Biomarkers Prev.,2004-09-01,"The study was designed to test the feasibility that lower genital tract cytology is a compatible medium for robust germ line genetic analyses. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene mutational analysis was done on DNA isolated from liquid-based cervical or vaginal cytology taken from 17 consenting women (age 29-65 years) who previously had genetic counseling followed by BRACAnalysis (Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT) blood analyses. Eleven women had known mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 (cases) and six had no identified mutations (controls) on entry into the study. Anonymized cytology samples were sent to Myriad Genetics with a request for testing that was limited to the degree of genomic testing previously done on the blood samples. One cervicovaginal specimen from a test-positive woman had inadequate cellular content that precluded gene sequencing and therefore was excluded from this analysis. For the 16 women with adequate cytologic specimens, there was 100% concordance for BRCA mutation test results between blood and genital tract cytology (kappa = 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.0). We have shown the feasibility of using liquid-based genital tract cytology as an alternative biospecimen to blood for germ line genetic analysis using a clinical approved assay.

Laparoscopic training and practice in gynecologic oncology among Society of Gynecologic Oncologists members and fellows-in-training.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-09-01,"To determine the proportion of Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO) members performing laparoscopic procedures and to determine SGO members' and fellows' opinions regarding indications for and the adequacy of training in laparoscopy. Surveys were mailed to SGO members and fellows-in-training in December 2002. Anonymous responses were collected by mail or through a Web site. The survey was mailed twice and was estimated to take 5 min to complete. The data were analyzed using frequency distributions and nonparametric tests. Three hundred thirty-six SGO members (45%) and fifty-seven fellows (49%) responded. Among SGO members, 272 (84%) currently performed laparoscopic surgeries. Reasons cited for performing laparoscopy were decreased length of hospital stay (74%), improved patient quality of life (57%), patient preference (48%), improved cosmesis (46%), and better visualization (18%). Among those who did not perform laparoscopy, 50% cited increased operating time as their main reason. When asked to indicate the laparoscopic procedure most commonly performed in their practice, 69% reported diagnosis of an adnexal mass; 11%, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies; and 10%, laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and lymph node staging for uterine cancer. Only 3% of SGO respondents performed more than 50% of their procedures laparoscopically, and all respondents reported converting from laparoscopy to laparotomy less than 25% of the time. Most respondents had limited laparoscopic training during their fellowships: 39% received none, and 46% received limited (less than five procedures per month) training. Nevertheless, 78% of SGO respondents rated their laparoscopic skills as either very good or good. Among fellows, only 25% believed they were receiving very good or good laparoscopic training.

Oncol.,2005-01-01,"To determine the toxicity, tolerability, and feasibility of delivering combination chemotherapy with subsequent radiation therapy to women with high-risk endometrial cancer and to evaluate the long-term bowel toxicity of this regimen. The trial was approved by the Dana Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DFPCC) Institutional Review Board (IRB). Patients with stage 3 or stage 4 endometrial cancer or patients with high-risk histology and any stage disease were prospectively entered. Complete surgical staging and a normal gated blood pool scan were required prior to entry. Patients were treated with three cycles of paclitaxel (160 mg/m(2) ), doxorubicin (45 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (AUC 5) (TAC) all on day 1 of a 21-day schedule as an outpatient with G-CSF support. At the conclusion of chemotherapy, patients received radiation therapy (4500 cGy to the whole pelvis) commencing within 35 days of the last cycle of chemotherapy. Paraaortic radiation and/or vaginal brachytherapy were allowed at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Twenty patients were entered onto the trial from November 2000 through February 2003. Eighteen patients successfully completed the trial, and two patients came off trial during chemotherapy (both later completed planned radiation therapy). Patients were initially stage 1 (n = 3), stage 3 (n = 14), and stage 4 (n = 3). Papillary serous was the dominant histology with 13 patients. Chemotherapy was given on average within 32 days of surgery (range 11-63 days) and radiation was initiated on average within 14 weeks of surgery (range 10-18 weeks). Chemotherapy was well tolerated, with 57 total cycles delivered of a planned 60 cycles. Two patients required dose modification in two cycles (two patients in cycle 3 secondary to hematologic toxicity). No grade 3 or grade 4 neurotoxicity was reported. There were six episodes of grade 3 short-term toxicity with radiation therapy reported in a single patient. Late radiotherapy toxicity included bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy in two patients and grade 3 constipation in one patient. Late radiation toxicity data are still being collected as follow-up continues. The TAC chemotherapy regimen is well tolerated and three cycles were delivered successfully with G-CSF support without evidence of the neurotoxicity or cardiac toxicity reported with the cisplatin containing TAP regimen.

Feasibility of dose escalation using intensity-modulated radiotherapy in posthysterectomy cervical carcinoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-03-01,"To evaluate retrospectively the utility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in reducing the volume of normal tissues receiving radiation at varying dose levels when the female pelvis after hysterectomy is treated to doses of 50.4 Gy and 54 Gy. Computed tomography scans from 10 patients who had previously undergone conventional postoperative RT were selected. The clinical tumor volume (vaginal apex and iliac nodes) and organs at risk were contoured. Margins were added to generate the planning tumor volume. The Pinnacle and Corvus planning systems were used to develop conventional and IMRT plans, respectively. Conventional four-field plans were prescribed to deliver 45 Gy (4F(45 Gy)) or 50.4 Gy; eight-field IMRT plans were prescribed to deliver 50.4 Gy (IMRT(50.4 Gy)) or 54 Gy (IMRT(54 Gy)) to the planning tumor volume. All plans were normalized so that > or =97% of the planning tumor volume received the prescribed dose. Student's t test was used to compare the volumes of organs at risk receiving the same doses with different plans. The mean volume of bowel receiving > or =45 Gy was lower with the IMRT(50.4 Gy) (33% lower) and IMRT(54 Gy) (18% lower) plans than with the 4F(45 Gy) plan. The mean volume of rectum receiving > or =45 Gy or > or =50 Gy was also significantly reduced with the IMRT plans despite an escalation of the prescribed dose from 45 Gy with the conventional plans to 54 Gy with IMRT. The mean volume of bladder treated to 45 Gy was the same or slightly lower with the IMRT(50.4 Gy) and IMRT(54 Gy) plans compared with the 4F(45 Gy) plan. Compared with the 4F(45 Gy) plan, the IMRT(50.4 Gy) plan resulted in a smaller volume of bowel receiving 35-45 Gy and a larger volume of bowel receiving 50-55 Gy. Compared with the 4F(45 Gy) plan, the IMRT(54 Gy) plan resulted in smaller volumes of bowel receiving 45-50 Gy; however, small volumes of bowel received 55-60 Gy with the IMRT plan.

Clitoral therapy device for treatment of sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-03-01,"The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of the clitoral therapy device (Eros Therapy) in alleviating sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients. Eligible patients had a history of cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy and self-reported sexual dysfunction of sexual arousal and/or orgasmic disorders. Patients used the noninvasive, nonpharmacologic clitoral therapy device using a hand-held, battery-powered vacuum to cause clitoral engorgement four times weekly for 3 months during foreplay and self-stimulation. Study instruments included the Female Sexual Function Index, Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning, and Dyadic Adjustment Scale. The outcome evaluation was performed at 3 months. Between 2001 and 2002, 15 women were enrolled and 13 completed the study. The median patient age and radiotherapy-enrollment interval was 43.5 years and 2 years, respectively. At baseline, all patients reported symptoms of sexual arousal and/or orgasmic disorders, and some also had sexual desire and pain disorders. At 3 months, statistically significant improvements were seen in all domains tested, including sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and reduced pain. The median Female Sexual Function Index total score increased from 17 to 29.4 (maximal score, 36; p <0.001). The median Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning total raw score increased from 46 to 95 (maximal score, 118; p <0.001). At baseline, the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning total T-score corresponded to the bottom 10th percentile of normal sexual functioning. At 3 months, the total T-score placed the patients at the normalcy cutoff. Gynecologic examinations revealed improved mucosal color and moisture and vaginal elasticity and decreased bleeding and ulceration. Our results from this pilot study suggest that the clitoral therapy device may alleviate sexual dysfunction in irradiated cervical cancer patients.

All participants completed a one-time self-report survey. We present data acquired via the following methods: Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Events Scale (IES), Modified Inventory of Traumatic Grief (M-ITG), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Menopausal Symptom Checklist. The study sample consisted of 20 women, ages 27 to 49 years (mean, approximately 40 years), who had undergone treatment for cervical (40%), ovarian (20%), or uterine (40%) cancer. Forty percent of the sample reported depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D, with 35% of the women experiencing moderate to severe levels of distress as measured by the IES. The women in this sample experienced dissatisfaction with their overall sex lives (67%), pain during vaginal penetration (62%), and low levels of sexual desire (56%).

Pediatric radical abdominal trachelectomy for cervical clear cell carcinoma: a novel surgical approach.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Clear cell carcinoma of the cervix and vagina is rare in the pediatric population. Many of these tumors are associated with prior intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. All DES-associated tumors are believed to contain microsatellite instability (MI). Historically, the recommended treatment is radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, which result in infertility in all cases. Radical abdominal or vaginal trachelectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is a new technique utilized in adult women with early cervical cancer who wish to retain fertility. This novel approach is also pertinent to the pediatric patient and is described in this report. A molecular analysis is also performed to determine if these are DES-associated tumors. Due to the narrow vaginal anatomy in pediatric patients, a vaginal approach is not possible, and an abdominal approach is performed. The resection includes the cervix, upper vagina, parametrium, and paracolpos. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed in a similar manner to the adult patient. Matched pairs of normal and tumor DNA from both cases were examined for evidence of MI using a consensus panel of microsatellite markers. Two girls aged 6 and 8 years and without history of DES exposure presented with vaginal bleeding. Vaginoscopy revealed cervical polyp in both cases. Biopsies demonstrated clear cell cancer stage IB1 in both patients. They underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection along with anastomosis of uterine isthmus to upper vagina. Intraoperative frozen-section analysis confirmed negative uterine and vaginal margins. No adjuvant treatment was given and both girls remain disease free.

Intravaginal brachytherapy alone for intermediate-risk endometrial cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-05-01,"Despite the results of the Gynecologic Oncology Group trial No. 99 (GOG#99), some unanswered questions still remain about the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. First, can intravaginal brachytherapy (IVRT) alone substitute for external beam RT but without added morbidity? Second, is the high-risk (HR) definition from GOG#99 a useful tool to predict pelvic recurrence specifically? The purpose of this study was to try to answer these questions in a group of patients with Stage IB-IIB endometrial carcinoma treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) IVRT alone. Between November 1987 and December 2002, 382 patients with Stage IB-IIB endometrial carcinoma were treated with simple hysterectomy followed by HDR-IVRT alone at our institution. Comprehensive surgical staging (CSS), defined as pelvic washings and pelvic/paraaortic lymph node sampling, was performed in 20% of patients. The mean age was 60 years (range, 29-92 years). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was present in 14% of patients. The median HDR-IVRT dose was 21 Gy (range, 6-21 Gy), given in three fractions. Complications were assessed in terms of late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (Grade 3 or worse) toxicity of the GI tract, genitourinary GU tract, and vagina. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the 5-year vaginal/pelvic control rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-98%). On multivariate analysis, a poor vaginal/pelvic control rate correlated with age > or =60 years old (relative risk [RR], 3, 95% CI, 1-12; p = 0.01), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Grade 3 (RR, 9, 95% CI, 2-35; p = 0.03), and LVI (RR, 4, 95% CI, 1-13; p = 0.051). The depth of myometrial invasion and CSS, however, were not significant. With regard to pelvic control specifically, the presence of GOG#99 HR features did not affect the pelvic control rate. The 5-year rate for HR patients was 96% (95% CI, 90-100%) vs. 96% (95% CI, 94-99%) for those without HR disease (p = 0.48). Even when the CSS effect was taken into account, the influence of HR features on pelvic control was still not significant (p = 0.51). In contrast, pelvic control was significantly influenced when patients were grouped according to CSS and stage/grade substages. For those with Stage IB Grade 3-IIB and no CSS, the 5-year pelvic control rate was 86% compared with 97% for those with Stage IB Grade 3-IIB and CSS, 97% for Stage IB, Grade 1-2 without CSS, and 100% for those with Stage IB, Grade 1-2 and CSS (p = 0.027). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 93% (95% CI, 90-96%). On multivariate analysis, poor disease-free survival correlated with age > or =60 years (RR, 5; 95% CI, 1-18; p = 0.002), FIGO Grade 3 (RR 5, 95% CI 2-17; p = 0.013), and LVI (RR 3, 95% CI 1-8; p = 0.054). Unlike pelvic control, disease-free survival was significantly affected by GOG#99 HR features, with a 5-year rate of 87% (95% CI, 76-99%) vs. 94% (95% CI, 91-97%) for those without HR features (p = 0.027). The 5-year overall and disease-specific survival rate was 93% and 97%, respectively. The overall 5-year actuarial rate of Grade 3 or worse complications was 1% (95% CI, 0-2%). Tumor grade, depth of invasion, and the use of CSS were better predictors of pelvic control than the GOG#99 HR factors. IVRT alone seemed to provide adequate tumor control with very low morbidity. Therefore, it seems prudent to consider it for intermediate-risk patients because of its superior therapeutic ratio compared with that for surgery alone or pelvic RT. Additional follow-up, however, with a larger number of patients is needed, especially for those with LVI.",Journal Article,5378.0,102.0,Despite Gynecologic Oncology Group trial 99 GOG 99 unanswered

Definitive radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-05-01,"To evaluate outcome and describe clinical treatment guidelines for patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina treated with definitive radiation therapy. Between 1970 and 2000, a total of 193 patients were treated with definitive radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The patients' medical records were reviewed to obtain information about patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, as well as outcome and patterns of recurrence. Surviving patients were followed for a median of 137 months. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences assessed using log-rank tests. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and pelvic disease control rates correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and tumor size. At 5 years, DSS rates were 85% for the 50 patients with Stage I, 78% for the 97 patients with Stage II, and 58% for the 46 patients with Stage III-IVA disease (p = 0.0013). Five-year DSS rates were 82% and 60% for patients with tumors < or =4 cm or >4 cm, respectively (p = 0.0001). At 5 years, pelvic disease control rates were 86% for Stage I, 84% for Stage II, and 71% for Stage III-IVA (p = 0.027). The predominant mode of relapse after definitive radiation therapy was local-regional (68% and 83%, respectively, for patients with stages I-II or III-IVA disease). The incidence of major complications was correlated with FIGO stage; at 5 years, the rates of major complications were 4% for Stage I, 9% for Stage II, and 21% for Stage III-IVA (p < 0.01). Excellent outcomes can be achieved with definitive radiation therapy for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina. However, to achieve these results, treatment must be individualized according to the site and size of the tumor at presentation and the response to initial external-beam radiation therapy.

Predictors of vaginal relapse in stage I endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-06-01,"To identify factors predictive of vaginal relapse in stage I endometrial cancer, thereby potentially facilitating the selection of patients who may benefit from vaginal brachytherapy. The study population included 632 patients with stage I endometrial cancer managed with hysterectomy at our institution between 1984 and 1996. Median follow-up was 73 months; 122 patients (19%) received adjuvant radiotherapy. Overall, 2.9% of the stage I cohort developed vaginal relapse at 5 years. Vaginal relapse was observed in 1.7% of patients who received radiotherapy and in 3.0% of those whose treatment did not include radiotherapy (P = 0.36). Cox regression analysis (including radiotherapy) identified only grade 3 differentiation (hazard ratio = 3.83, P = 0.007) as an independent predictor of vaginal relapse. Patients with a low-grade tumor had a 5-year vaginal relapse rate of 2%, compared with 7% for those with a grade 3 tumor. When only patients who did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy were considered, both grade 3 tumor and lymphovascular invasion were significant predictors of vaginal relapse (P < 0.05). When neither variable was present, 2% of patients experienced vaginal relapse at 5 years, compared with 11% when either 1 was present (P < 0.001). Depth of myometrial invasion was not a significant predictor of vaginal recurrence. Histologic grade 3 tumor and lymphovascular invasion were the cogent predictors of vaginal relapse in our population.

The clinical consequences of acute methemoglobinemia can be devastating and include lethargy, headache, and dyspnea and, as methemoglobin concentrations rise, respiratory depression, confusion, seizures, and even death. Here we present a case of acute methemoglobinemia induced by exposure to topical vaginal sulfanilamide cream in a 36-year-old woman with a FIGO stage IIIB squamous cell cervical carcinoma. Although methemoglobinemia associated with topical anesthetics has been well documented, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of methemoglobinemia induced by exposure to topical sulfanilamide cream.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy after hysterectomy: comparison with conventional treatment and sensitivity of the normal-tissue-sparing effect to margin size.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-07-01,"To determine the influence of target-volume expansion on the reduction in small-bowel dose achieved with use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. standard conformal treatment of the pelvis after hysterectomy, and to investigate the influence of patient body habitus on the normal-tissue sparing achieved with use of IMRT. A clinical target volume (CTV) was contoured on each of 10 planning computed tomography scans of patients who had been treated for cervical or endometrial cancer after a hysterectomy. Treatment planning was based on vaginal CTVs and regional nodal CTVs. To account for internal motion, margins were added to form an initial planning target volume (PTVA) as follows: 0.0 mm were added to the regional nodal CTV; 10 mm were added anteriorly to the vaginal CTV; and 5 mm were added to the vaginal CTV in all other directions. Two further PTVs (PTVB and PTVC) were produced by a 5-mm expansion of PTVA to give PTVB and a further 5-mm expansion to give PTVC. Treatment plans for all 3 PTVs were produced by use of 2 conformal fields (2FC), 4 conformal fields (4FC), or IMRT to deliver 45 Gy to more than 97% of the PTV. The primary goal of IMRT was to spare small bowel. The change in sparing that accompanied the increase in margin size was assessed by comparison of dose-volume histograms that resulted from PTVA, PTVB, and PTVC. Measured patient dimensions were correlated with bowel sparing. Significantly less small bowel was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001) or 4FC (p < 0.0001) for doses greater than 25 Gy. Significantly less rectum was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001) or 4FC (p < 0.0001). Significantly less bladder was irradiated by IMRT than by 2FC (p < 0.0001). However, the magnitude of the sparing achieved by use of IMRT decreased as margins increased. In particular, the volume of small bowel spared by IMRT vs. 2FC or 4FC decreased as margin size increased (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.008 for 2FC and 4FC, respectively). The amount of normal-tissue sparing achieved by use of IMRT vs. 4FC was inversely correlated with patient body mass index. Because the small-bowel sparing achieved with use of IMRT is markedly reduced by relatively small expansions of the target volume, accurate target delineation, highly reproducible patient immobilization, and a clear understanding of internal-organ motion are needed to achieve optimal advantage in the use of IMRT over conventional methods of posthysterectomy pelvic radiation therapy.",Comparative Study,5317.0,106.0,determine influence target-volume expansion reduction small-bowel dose achieved use intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT vs. standard conformal treatment pelvis hysterectomy investigate influence patient body habitus normal-tissue sparing achieved use IMRT clinical target volume CTV contoured 10 planning computed tomography scans patients treated cervical endometrial hysterectomy Treatment planning based vaginal CTVs regional nodal CTVs account internal motion margins added form initial planning target volume PTVA follows 0.0 mm added regional nodal CTV 10 mm added anteriorly vaginal CTV 5 mm added vaginal CTV directions PTVs PTVB PTVC produced 5-mm expansion PTVA PTVB 5-mm expansion PTVC Treatment plans 3 PTVs produced use 2 conformal fields 2FC 4 conformal fields 4FC IMRT deliver 45 Gy 97 PTV primary goal IMRT spare small bowel change sparing accompanied increase margin size assessed comparison dose-volume histograms resulted PTVA PTVB PTVC Measured patient dimensions correlated bowel sparing Significantly small bowel irradiated IMRT 2FC p 0.0001 4FC p 0.0001 doses greater 25 Gy Significantly rectum irradiated IMRT 2FC p 0.0001 4FC p 0.0001 Significantly bladder irradiated IMRT 2FC p 0.0001 magnitude sparing achieved use IMRT decreased margins increased particular volume small bowel spared IMRT vs. 2FC 4FC decreased margin size increased p 0.0002 p 0.008 2FC 4FC respectively normal-tissue sparing achieved use IMRT vs. 4FC inversely correlated patient body mass index small-bowel sparing achieved use IMRT markedly reduced relatively small expansions target volume accurate target delineation highly reproducible patient immobilization clear understanding internal-organ motion needed achieve optimal advantage use IMRT conventional methods posthysterectomy pelvic radiation therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 1054, 1, 283, 433, 1422, 23, 3, 628, 4, 302, 1659, 61, 513, 5, 119, 1, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 105, 260, 2972, 24, 1, 3, 3270, 50, 2622, 2, 6, 963, 3, 1054, 1, 69, 642, 23459, 23, 3, 295, 246, 1851, 513, 5, 119, 1, 964, 8, 38, 283, 433, 3402, 10, 6476, 23, 296, 1, 79, 1349, 1220, 872, 1441, 1, 7, 54, 42, 85, 73, 9, 15, 12, 50, 8, 2622, 24, 1349, 10, 90, 23, 14256, 2, 951, 779, 14256, 6, 1967, 9, 2329, 2967, 1012, 11, 1953, 6, 1297, 35, 388, 1349, 283, 433, 37953, 22, 2962, 13, 13, 321, 11, 1953, 6, 3, 951, 779, 3402, 79, 321, 11, 1953, 22232, 6, 3, 3402, 2, 33, 321, 11, 1953, 6, 3, 3402, 4, 62, 127, 3540, 100, 195, 13631, 37954, 2, 37955, 11, 1687, 20, 8, 33, 321, 1422, 1, 37953, 6, 4978, 37954, 2, 8, 195, 33, 321, 1422, 6, 4978, 37955, 24, 1853, 9, 62, 27, 13631, 11, 1687, 20, 119, 1, 18, 2972, 3130, 26413, 39, 2972, 3130, 28426, 15, 964, 6, 3392, 512, 381, 6, 80, 76, 1015, 1, 3, 3303, 3, 86, 1326, 1, 964, 10, 6, 8539, 302, 1659, 3, 707, 4, 1851, 17, 2756, 3, 344, 4, 959, 444, 10, 275, 20, 1155, 1, 61, 433, 8638, 17, 627, 29, 37953, 37954, 2, 37955, 644, 69, 6190, 11, 438, 5, 1659, 1851, 97, 299, 302, 1659, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 15, 28426, 19, 13, 488, 9, 415, 378, 76, 243, 381, 97, 299, 3660, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 15, 28426, 19, 13, 488, 97, 299, 10, 2398, 20, 964, 76, 20, 26413, 19, 13, 488, 137, 3, 3131, 1, 3, 1851, 513, 20, 119, 1, 964, 340, 22, 1012, 101, 4, 1454, 3, 433, 1, 302, 1659, 6830, 20, 964, 105, 26413, 15, 28426, 340, 22, 959, 444, 101, 19, 13, 3531, 2, 19, 13, 2155, 9, 26413, 2, 28426, 106, 3, 3108, 1, 295, 246, 1851, 513, 20, 119, 1, 964, 105, 28426, 10, 2659, 438, 5, 69, 642, 782, 558, 408, 3, 302, 1659, 1851, 513, 5, 119, 1, 964, 16, 2195, 405, 20, 1352, 302, 12384, 1, 3, 283, 433, 1481, 283, 5529, 561, 4172, 69, 10161, 2, 8, 885, 612, 1, 2329, 1259, 2967, 32, 575, 6, 1359, 665, 1874, 4, 3, 119, 1, 964, 252, 809, 636, 1, 33916, 1110, 121, 36]",2371.0,15990017,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy hysterectomy comparison conventional treatment sensitivity normal-tissue-sparing effect margin size,0,0.0

Between April 1998 and March 2004, 100 patients with Stage I endometrial cancer underwent surgical staging (total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic +/- paraaortic nodal sampling) and postoperative vaginal high-dose-rate brachytherapy at our institution. The total dose was 2100 cGy in three fractions. With a median follow-up of 23 months (range 2-62), no pelvic or vaginal recurrences developed. All patients underwent pelvic dissection, and 42% underwent paraaortic nodal dissection. A median of 29.5 pelvic nodes (range 1-67) was removed (84% had >10 pelvic nodes removed). Most patients (73%) had endometrioid (or unspecified) adenocarcinoma, 16% had papillary serous carcinoma, and 11% had other histologic types.

Association of low-grade endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus and ovary with undifferentiated carcinoma: a new type of dedifferentiated carcinoma?,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2006-01-01,"Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, either of the endometrium or the ovaries, usually have an excellent prognosis. The association of this type of tumor with undifferentiated carcinoma is rare. In this study, we present the clinicopathologic features of 25 such cases. The age of the patients ranged from 30 to 82 years (median, 51 years). At presentation, the patients had either vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain. The endometrioid carcinoma involved the endometrium in 14 cases, the endometrium and 1 or both ovaries in 9 cases, and the ovaries in 2 cases. Undifferentiated carcinoma associated with low-grade endometrioid carcinoma was found at presentation in 19 grade 1 or 2 endometrioid carcinomas: 15 in the endometrium and 5 in the ovary. In one of these cases, undifferentiated carcinoma was found in the endometrium and the ovary. Undifferentiated carcinoma was found after resection of low-grade endometrioid carcinoma in six cases, involving the retroperitoneum, pelvis, vagina, or liver. The undifferentiated carcinoma was composed exclusively of diffuse sheets and solid nests of epithelial cells in l0 cases. Epithelial cells with isolated foci of keratinization were seen in nine cases and rhabdoid cells in a myxoid background in six cases. Twenty-four patients were treated with total abdominal hysterectomy and with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Twenty-two patients received additional therapy as follows: chemotherapy (), radiotherapy (), and tamoxifen (). Follow-up showed that 15 patients died of disease in 1 to 60 months (median, 6 months), and 5 patients are alive with progressive disease with a follow-up between 6 and 8 months; 1 patient is alive with no evidence of disease at 104 months. In four cases, the diagnosis was made recently, with short follow-ups of 3 and 4 months. Foci of undifferentiated carcinoma may be confused with solid endometrioid adenocarcinoma erroneously leading to the diagnosis of a grade 3 or a significantly less aggressive grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma. The recognition of undifferentiated carcinoma in an otherwise low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma is extremely important because it indicates aggressive behavior. In asynchronous cases, being aware of this association can explain the absence of a second primary.",Journal Article,5133.0,134.0,Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas endometrium ovaries usually excellent prognosis association type undifferentiated carcinoma rare present clinicopathologic features 25 cases age patients ranged 30 82 years median 51 years presentation patients vaginal bleeding pelvic pain endometrioid carcinoma involved endometrium 14 cases endometrium 1 ovaries 9 cases ovaries 2 cases Undifferentiated carcinoma associated low-grade endometrioid carcinoma presentation 19 grade 1 2 endometrioid carcinomas 15 endometrium 5 ovary cases undifferentiated carcinoma endometrium ovary Undifferentiated carcinoma resection low-grade endometrioid carcinoma cases involving retroperitoneum pelvis vagina liver undifferentiated carcinoma composed exclusively diffuse sheets solid nests epithelial l0 cases Epithelial isolated foci keratinization seen cases rhabdoid myxoid background cases Twenty-four patients treated total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Twenty-two patients received additional therapy follows chemotherapy radiotherapy tamoxifen Follow-up showed 15 patients died disease 1 60 months median 6 months 5 patients alive progressive disease follow-up 6 8 months 1 patient alive evidence disease 104 months cases diagnosis recently short follow-ups 3 4 months Foci undifferentiated carcinoma confused solid endometrioid adenocarcinoma erroneously leading diagnosis grade 3 significantly aggressive grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma recognition undifferentiated carcinoma low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma extremely important indicates aggressive behavior asynchronous cases aware association explain absence second primary,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[154, 88, 3151, 826, 361, 1, 3, 15, 3, 7262, 2082, 47, 35, 1503, 356, 3, 248, 1, 26, 267, 1, 30, 5, 4480, 134, 16, 622, 4, 26, 45, 21, 364, 3, 1399, 404, 1, 243, 225, 140, 3, 89, 1, 3, 7, 1869, 29, 201, 6, 878, 60, 52, 725, 60, 28, 1031, 3, 7, 42, 361, 2294, 15, 1110, 559, 3, 3151, 134, 646, 3, 4, 213, 140, 3, 2, 14, 15, 110, 7262, 4, 83, 140, 2, 3, 7262, 4, 18, 140, 4480, 134, 41, 5, 154, 88, 3151, 134, 10, 204, 28, 1031, 4, 326, 88, 14, 15, 18, 3151, 826, 167, 4, 3, 2, 33, 4, 3, 3631, 4, 104, 1, 46, 140, 4480, 134, 10, 204, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3631, 4480, 134, 10, 204, 50, 170, 1, 154, 88, 3151, 134, 4, 437, 140, 1267, 3, 7765, 3270, 7553, 15, 3, 4480, 134, 10, 3317, 4437, 1, 1388, 13568, 2, 537, 14121, 1, 701, 37, 4, 55177, 140, 701, 37, 5, 1355, 3340, 1, 30879, 11, 527, 4, 762, 140, 2, 37, 4, 8, 5707, 2426, 4, 437, 140, 737, 294, 7, 11, 73, 5, 181, 1467, 2622, 2, 5, 1607, 5690, 3470, 737, 100, 7, 103, 402, 36, 22, 2962, 56, 310, 2, 1105, 166, 126, 224, 17, 167, 7, 1016, 1, 34, 4, 14, 6, 335, 53, 52, 49, 53, 2, 33, 7, 32, 1701, 5, 1014, 34, 5, 8, 166, 126, 59, 49, 2, 66, 53, 14, 69, 16, 1701, 5, 77, 241, 1, 34, 28, 3407, 53, 4, 294, 140, 3, 147, 10, 1229, 761, 5, 978, 166, 6106, 1, 27, 2, 39, 53, 3340, 1, 4480, 134, 68, 40, 21075, 5, 537, 3151, 449, 27829, 1049, 6, 3, 147, 1, 8, 88, 27, 15, 8, 97, 299, 571, 88, 18, 3151, 134, 3, 2335, 1, 4480, 134, 4, 35, 2632, 154, 88, 3151, 449, 16, 2938, 305, 408, 192, 2640, 571, 1710, 4, 18272, 140, 486, 4749, 1, 26, 248, 122, 2943, 3, 1127, 1, 8, 419, 86]",2142.0,16306785,Association low-grade endometrioid carcinoma uterus ovary undifferentiated carcinoma new type dedifferentiated carcinoma,3,0.01507537688442211

Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology,Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,2005-12-20,"Over the years, endometrial cancer has remained the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Two categories of endometrial cancer exist: type I and type II. Type I cancers constitute the majority of cases of endometrial cancer, and the risk factors for this type have been studied in greatest detail. These cancers are driven by estrogen, and many of the risk factors are directly or indirectly linked to a state of excessive estrogen. Protective factors seem to be related to conditions that may result in decreased estrogen exposure. Cure rates for endometrial cancer remain high, mainly because of the early stage at which the majority of cases present. Warning signs of abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge allow detection of these cancers in their early stages. Screening for these cancers is not effective and often leads to additional unnecessary tests; thus, it is not currently recommended in the general population.",Journal Article,5145.0,50.0,years endometrial remained common gynecologic malignancy United States categories endometrial exist type type II Type constitute majority cases endometrial risk factors type studied greatest driven estrogen risk factors directly indirectly linked state excessive estrogen Protective factors related conditions decreased estrogen exposure Cure rates endometrial remain high mainly early stage majority cases present Warning signs abnormal vaginal bleeding discharge allow detection early stages Screening effective leads additional unnecessary tests currently recommended general population,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[252, 3, 60, 12, 71, 958, 3, 96, 186, 1512, 710, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 100, 1996, 1, 12, 1923, 267, 70, 2, 267, 215, 267, 70, 163, 4999, 3, 686, 1, 140, 1, 12, 2, 3, 43, 130, 9, 26, 267, 47, 85, 656, 4, 2199, 5000, 46, 163, 32, 1621, 20, 808, 2, 445, 1, 3, 43, 130, 32, 1606, 15, 7792, 1199, 6, 8, 1309, 1, 4529, 808, 2864, 130, 3233, 6, 40, 139, 6, 1298, 17, 68, 757, 4, 340, 808, 645, 1722, 151, 9, 12, 918, 64, 2615, 408, 1, 3, 191, 82, 28, 92, 3, 686, 1, 140, 364, 15986, 3408, 1, 1668, 2294, 15, 2993, 1700, 638, 1, 46, 163, 4, 136, 191, 1153, 453, 9, 46, 163, 16, 44, 323, 2, 629, 1940, 6, 402, 4224, 895, 631, 192, 16, 44, 694, 793, 4, 3, 1083, 266]",872.0,16364689,Screening prevention gynecologic endometrial,0,0.0
Total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy: the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center experience.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-02-10,"To retrospectively evaluate the feasibility and morbidity of total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy at our institution between May 2004 and August 2005. Data collected included age, body mass index, stage, histopathologic subtype, tumor grade, estimated blood loss, perioperative blood transfusions, number and status of lymph nodes obtained, status of surgical margins, length of hospital stay, time to resumption of normal bladder function, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and disease-free interval. Twenty patients underwent total laparoscopic radical hysterectomy during the study period. None of the surgeries required conversion to laparotomy. The median patient age was 41.5 years (range, 25-76). Eighteen patients had cervix cancer (5 stage IA2 and 13 stage IB1), and 2 had endometrial cancer (1 stage IB and 1 stage IIIA). Among those with cervix cancer, 12 had adenocarcinoma, 4 squamous cell carcinoma, and 2 adenosquamous carcinoma. The median weight was 70 kg (range, 49-112). The median number of resected pelvic lymph nodes was 13 (range, 9-26). One patient had nodal disease. The surgical margins were free of disease in all cases. The median blood loss was 200 ml (range, 25-700 ml). Only 1 patient required an intraoperative blood transfusion (1 U packed red blood cells). The median length of hospital stay was 1 day (range, 1-5). There were 3 short-term complications--unintentional cystotomy, pulmonary embolus, and pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema. There were 2 long-term complications--vaginal eviscerations and a lymphocyst. The median time to resumption of normal bladder function was 16 days (range, 13-29). The median follow-up time was 8 months range (1-16). All patients remain free of disease at the time of this report.

Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina with Merkel cell carcinoma phenotype.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2006-03-01,"We describe a case of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma arising from the anterior vaginal wall of a 67-year-old woman. Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina is a rare entity with only 25 previously reported cases in the literature. In previous reports, these tumors have not been distinguished from primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell carcinoma). The tumor was composed of cells that showed neuroendocrine-type nuclear features with hyperchromasia, nuclear molding, occasional small nucleoli, and a chromatin pattern that was finely granular. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), neuron specific enolase, pancytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and chromogranin A expression. Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was also positive in>90% of cells. The tumor cells showed intense expression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein and mild to moderate expression of c-KIT. Synaptophysin, neurofilament, CD45, CD56, CD10, S-100, HMB-45, cytokeratin 7, and thyroid transcription factor 1 were negative. This pattern of staining is consistent with a Merkel cell carcinoma. This is the first report of a primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina with a Merkel cell phenotype. Previous studies have not distinguished primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the vagina from Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin.

A dosimetric analysis of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as an alternative to adjuvant high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in early endometrial cancer patients.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2006-05-01,"To evaluate the role of intensity-modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) as an alternative to high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in the treatment of the vagina in postoperative early endometrial cancer patients after surgery. Planning computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 patients previously treated with HDR were used in this study. In all cases, a dose of 700 cGy/fraction was prescribed at a distance of 0.5 cm from the cylinder surface. The same CT scans were then used in IMRT planning. In this paradigm, the vaginal cylinder represents a component of a hypothetical immobilization system that would be indexed to the linac treatment table. Our study showed that IMRT provided relatively lower rectal doses than HDR when treatment was prescribed at a distance of 0.5 cm away from the cylinder surface. Maximum rectal doses were lower with IMRT compared with HDR (average: 89.0% vs. 142.6%, respectively, p < 0.05). Moreover, the mean rectal dose was lower in IMRT plans compared with HDR plans with treatment prescribed either to the surface (average: 14.8% vs. 21.4%, respectively, p < 0.05) or to 0.5 cm (average: 19.6% vs. 33.5%, respectively, p < 0.05).

Cystoscopic temporary ureteral catheterization during radical vaginal and abdominal trachelectomy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-06-06,"To describe the role of temporary retrograde ureteral catheterization at the time of fertility-sparing radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. We analyzed a prospectively maintained database of all patients with cervical cancer who were explored for radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy at our institution. Cystourethroscopy and ureteral catheterization were performed prior to the vaginal or abdominal operation in all patients, except two pediatric ones. Temporary bilateral retrograde ureteral catheters were planned for all patients as part of our routine procedure to facilitate identification of the distal ureters. 5Fr whistle-tip or open-ended catheters were used and usually advanced to approximately 20 cm. Catheters were removed at the end of the operation in all cases. All catheters were inserted by a gynecologic oncology fellow or attending. Between 11/01 and 12/05, 40 patients were taken to the operating room for planned fertility-sparing radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy. We previously reported on two pediatric patients; they are excluded from this report. The median age for adult patients was 32 years (mean, 31.6; range, 23-40). International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage included IB1 (26), IA2 (6), and IA1 with lymphovascular invasion (6). Thirty-four patients underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy and four underwent a radical abdominal trachelectomy. Two (5%) of 38 patients required immediate completion radical hysterectomy due to extensive endocervical disease (one in the vaginal group and one in the abdominal group). Bilateral ureteral catheters were inserted successfully in 37 (97%) of 38 patients and facilitated identification of the distal ureter during the dissection. In one case, the right ureteral orifice could not be successfully catheterized, and the case was completed with unilateral catheterization. The estimated time to perform this part of the operation was approximately 15-20 min. Twenty-eight patients (74%) had 5Fr whistle-tip ureteral catheters inserted, and 10 had open-ended catheters inserted. There were no intraoperative complications. Median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 3-7). Hematuria, evident in the drainage bag attached to the Foley catheter, usually resolved in 24-48 h. Two (20%) of 10 patients who had open-ended catheters inserted developed a transient rise in postoperative creatinine (1.7 and 3.5 mg/dl, respectively) compared to 0/28 patients who had whistle-tip catheters placed (P<0.001). Both were attributed to postoperative distal ureteral edema, and only one patient required reinsertion of temporary ureteral stents. No patient developed long-term urinary complications or fistulae. Cystourethroscopy and bilateral retrograde ureteral catheterization by gynecologic oncologists is a simple and quick procedure that may facilitate identifying the distal ureter during radical vaginal or abdominal trachelectomy. We favor using 5Fr whistle-tip catheters as they may be associated with less ureteral mucosal trauma and subsequent postoperative edema. The skills needed for this procedure should be available to fellows in gynecologic oncology training.",Journal Article,4977.0,22.0,role temporary retrograde ureteral catheterization time

Fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy for cervical carcinoma: technique and review of the literature.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-07-11,"Radical trachelectomy has emerged as a reasonable fertility-sparing operation for selected patients with stage I cervical cancer. The purpose of this report is to describe our technique of radical abdominal trachelectomy, a fertility-sparing operation in women with cervical cancer, and review the current literature on this procedure. A review of a prospectively maintained database of all fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy procedures performed at our institution. Between 11/01 and 3/06, we performed a total of 42 fertility-preserving radical trachelectomies with pelvic lymphadenectomy for women with invasive cervical cancer. We had previously reported on 2 pediatric abdominal trachelectomies, which are excluded from this report. Five of the remaining 40 cases had undergone a radical abdominal trachelectomy, and 35 cases were performed laparoscopically with a radical vaginal approach. The characteristics of the 5 adult patients who underwent abdominal radical trachelectomy included stage IB1 disease in all cases, a mean age of 36 years (range, 33-39), and a mean estimated blood loss of 280 ml (range, 50-400); 1 patient with squamous cell carcinoma needed completion radical hysterectomy at the time of trachelectomy due to disease extending into the endometrium, and 1 patient needed postoperative chemoradiation due to a positive parametrial lymph node. The remaining 3 patients resumed normal menstruation postoperatively. All patients remain disease-free at the time of this report. The only remaining uterine blood supply in these patients are the utero-ovarian vessels. There were no postoperative complications, and transurethral Foley catheters were removed in all cases within 2 weeks. Radical abdominal trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a feasible operation for selected women with stage I cervical cancer who desire to preserve reproductive function. Menstruation and reproductive function may be preserved after bilateral uterine vessel ligation.

The use of adjuvant radiation therapy in early endometrial cancer by members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists in 2005.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-12-20,"To determine current patterns of care for early stage endometrial cancer by the members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists (SGO). A survey detailing the use of adjuvant radiation in early stage endometrial cancer was conducted. Details of surgery, indications for staging, and use of adjuvant radiation for cases primarily seen by the respondent and for those cases referred postoperatively without staging information were collected and compared to a similar survey from 1999. The practice demographics of the respondents are similar to the 1999 survey. SGO members are now more likely to perform complete surgical staging during all surgeries for endometrial cancer than in 1999 (71% vs. 48%; P<0.0001). A higher percentage of respondents now describe surgery as a complete lymphadenectomy (76% vs. 44%: P<0.0001) and believe this is therapeutic (71% vs. 66%: P=0.04). Approximately half of SGO members now use laparoscopic assisted staging in the primary treatment of endometrial cancer. Since 1999, there is a significant decrease in the recommendation for postoperative RT. In almost all cases where RT is recommended, the use of vaginal RT is now more common than pelvic RT. In all situations, consult recommendations for additional intervention were more likely if complete surgical staging had not been performed, suggesting that all patients with endometrial cancer would benefit from surgery by a gynecologic oncologist.

Supracervical hysterectomy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2007-03-01,"To assess whether supracervical hysterectomy (SCH) is a reasonable alternative to total abdominal hysterectomy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We reviewed the records of patients with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent a SCH at one institution between 1993 and 2004 and a similar cohort who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) at the same institution during the same period. Patients without complete surgical staging done at the institution were excluded. Independent-sample t tests, Fisher exact test, and log rank tests were used for statistical analysis. The study included 47 patients who underwent SCH (mean age, 59.6 years) and 190 who underwent TAH. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age (P=.51), preoperative CA 125 level (P=.55), or receipt of taxane-based and platinum-based chemotherapy (P=.84). Although limited by sample size, there were no significant differences between the two groups in rates of intraoperative complications (4 of 47 in the SCH group, or 8.5%, compared with 7 of 190 in the TAH group, or 3.7%; P=.24), vaginal or cervical recurrence (5 of 47 in the SCH group, or 10.6%, compared with 22 of 190 in the TAH group, or 11.6%; P=1.00), or in progression-free survival (SCH of 1.01 years compared with TAH of 1.19 years; P=.64) or overall survival (SCH of 3.28 years compared with TAH of 3.36 years; P=.12).

Aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia syndrome.,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",Breast,2007-03-21,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are widely used as an adjuvant endocrine treatment in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials have assessed 5 years of AI therapy, either as an alternative to tamoxifen for primary adjuvant therapy of breast cancer, or after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. Treatment of 2-3 years' duration after 2-3 years of tamoxifen has also been studied. AI therapy brings side effects related to estrogen deprivation, and this side effect profile differs in clinically relevant ways from that seen with tamoxifen. In particular, the selective estrogen receptor modulatory effects of tamoxifen contribute to menopausal symptoms, vaginal discharge, and the rare but worrisome risks of thromboembolism and uterine carcinoma. By contrast, the low levels of estrogen achieved with aromatase inhibition contribute to menopausal symptoms, vaginal dryness and sexual dysfunction, and accelerated bone demineralization with risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture. Clinical experience also suggests that AI therapy is associated with a novel musculoskeletal side effect consisting of an arthralgia syndrome. The actual incidence of AI-associated arthralgias or musculoskeletal symptoms is not known, though such symptoms are quite prevalent and appear more commonly with AI use than with tamoxifen. Arthralgias can be a reason for discontinuation of AI treatment. The possible mechanisms of AI-associated arthralgia are unclear. Estrogen deficiency causes bone loss, which in turn contributes to arthralgia. Less well-studied functions of estrogen include regulating immune cells and cytokines involved in bone remodeling, and modulating pain sensitivity at the level of the central nervous system. Arthralgia and arthritis have seldom been rigorously differentiated in clinical trials of AIs. Assessment of inflammatory and rheumatologic markers, as well as detailed evaluation of patient symptoms using appropriate quality-of-life instruments, may be warranted in order to understand both the symptoms and the etiology of the arthralgia syndrome. Treatment options for arthralgia (primarily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are currently inadequate, but areas of active research include high-dose vitamin D and new-targeted therapies to inhibit bone loss.",Journal Article,4689.0,114.0,Aromatase inhibitors AIs widely adjuvant endocrine treatment postmenopausal women early-stage breast Clinical trials assessed 5 years AI therapy alternative tamoxifen primary adjuvant therapy breast 5 years adjuvant tamoxifen Treatment 2-3 years duration 2-3 years tamoxifen studied AI therapy brings effects related estrogen deprivation effect profile differs clinically relevant ways seen tamoxifen particular selective estrogen receptor modulatory effects tamoxifen contribute menopausal symptoms vaginal discharge rare worrisome risks thromboembolism uterine carcinoma contrast low levels estrogen achieved aromatase inhibition contribute menopausal symptoms vaginal dryness sexual dysfunction accelerated bone demineralization risk osteoporosis osteoporotic fracture Clinical experience suggests AI therapy associated novel musculoskeletal effect consisting arthralgia syndrome actual incidence AI-associated arthralgias musculoskeletal symptoms known symptoms prevalent appear commonly AI use tamoxifen Arthralgias reason discontinuation AI treatment possible mechanisms AI-associated arthralgia unclear Estrogen deficiency causes bone loss turn contributes arthralgia well-studied functions estrogen include regulating immune cytokines involved bone remodeling modulating pain sensitivity level central nervous Arthralgia arthritis seldom rigorously differentiated clinical trials AIs Assessment inflammatory rheumatologic markers detailed evaluation patient symptoms appropriate quality-of-life instruments warranted order understand symptoms etiology arthralgia syndrome Treatment options arthralgia primarily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs currently inadequate areas active research include high-dose vitamin new-targeted therapies inhibit bone loss,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2106, 222, 3826, 32, 1792, 95, 22, 35, 249, 1293, 24, 4, 1679, 117, 5, 191, 82, 12, 38, 143, 47, 275, 33, 60, 1, 2247, 36, 361, 22, 35, 1091, 6, 1105, 9, 86, 249, 36, 1, 12, 15, 50, 33, 60, 1, 249, 1105, 24, 1, 18, 27, 60, 654, 50, 18, 27, 60, 1, 1105, 71, 120, 85, 656, 2247, 36, 15249, 1152, 176, 139, 6, 808, 1868, 2, 26, 1152, 254, 800, 4990, 4, 505, 867, 4245, 29, 17, 527, 5, 1105, 4, 1454, 3, 1094, 808, 153, 11424, 176, 1, 1105, 1248, 6, 3565, 507, 2993, 2, 3, 622, 84, 13155, 1098, 1, 3501, 2, 134, 20, 748, 3, 154, 148, 1, 808, 513, 5, 2106, 297, 1248, 6, 3565, 507, 15822, 2, 2232, 1527, 2, 2241, 43086, 5, 43, 1, 4970, 2, 17303, 3956, 38, 730, 120, 844, 17, 2247, 36, 16, 41, 5, 8, 229, 5701, 1152, 254, 2273, 1, 35, 8451, 681, 3, 3480, 287, 1, 2247, 41, 13632, 15, 5701, 507, 16, 44, 440, 2471, 225, 507, 32, 6223, 2485, 2, 1322, 80, 841, 5, 2247, 119, 76, 5, 1105, 13632, 122, 40, 8, 3852, 9, 2007, 1, 2247, 24, 3, 899, 483, 1, 2247, 41, 8451, 32, 1200, 808, 2299, 1626, 407, 92, 4, 3854, 2444, 6, 8451, 299, 149, 656, 1681, 1, 808, 643, 2681, 250, 37, 2, 1886, 646, 4, 4429, 2, 3712, 559, 485, 28, 3, 301, 1, 3, 854, 1880, 398, 8451, 2, 8646, 47, 10805, 85, 10347, 1442, 4, 38, 143, 1, 3826, 455, 1, 1291, 2, 21444, 525, 22, 149, 22, 2455, 451, 1, 69, 507, 75, 870, 372, 1, 358, 4730, 68, 40, 1197, 4, 1732, 6, 1640, 110, 3, 507, 2, 3, 2855, 1, 3, 8451, 681, 24, 838, 9, 8451, 1561, 220, 7745, 312, 1291, 600, 32, 694, 3358, 84, 1361, 1, 544, 389, 643, 64, 61, 1610, 427, 2, 217, 238, 235, 6, 1433, 407]",2211.0,17368903,Aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia syndrome,0,0.0

Pts with recurrent cervical or vaginal cancer being evaluated for surgical resection were enrolled in a prospective study approved by the institutional human subjects review board. All patients underwent (18)FDG PET scans as well as CT and/or MRI scans and were required to have pathologic confirmation of any sites suggestive of tumor recurrence. Between 1998 and 2002 a total of 27 pts were enrolled on the study. Seven patients did not complete all study requirements and are excluded from further analysis. All pts had undergone prior pelvic radiation therapy and five patients had also received chemotherapy. CT/MRI scans identified three patients with possible metastatic disease in the following sites: (1) iliac nodes (2 pts) and (2) lungs (1 pt). After surgical and pathological evaluation, only one of these sites, the lungs, was confirmed to have metastatic disease. PET scans identified possible metastatic disease in nine patients and included the following sites: (1) pelvic nodes (4 pts), (2) para-aortic nodes (2 pts), (3) axillary node (1 pt), (4) bowel wall (1 pt) and (5) lungs (1 pt). After surgical and pathologic evaluation metastatic disease was identified in five of these pts at the following sites: iliac nodes, 2; para-aortic nodes, 1; bowel wall, 1; and lungs, 1. Of the sites identified by PET scan as areas of metastasis CT scan only identified the pulmonary metastasis.

Safety of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2007-10-03,"The third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane are replacing tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in most postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Although AIs have demonstrated superior efficacy and better overall safety compared with tamoxifen in randomized controlled trials, they may not provide the cardioprotective effects of tamoxifen, and bone loss may be a concern with their long-term adjuvant use. Patients require regular bone mineral density monitoring, and prophylactic bisphosphonates are being evaluated to determine whether they may protect long-term bone health. AIs decrease the risks of thromboembolic and cerebrovascular events compared with tamoxifen, and the overall rate of cardiovascular events in patients treated with AIs is within the range seen in age-matched, non-breast-cancer populations. AIs are also associated with a lower incidence of endometrial cancer and fewer vaginal bleeding/discharge events than tamoxifen. Compared with tamoxifen, the incidence of hot flashes is lower with anastrozole and letrozole but may be higher with exemestane. Generally, adverse events with AIs are predictable and manageable, whereas tamoxifen may be associated with life-threatening events in a minority of patients. Overall, the benefits of AIs over tamoxifen are achieved without compromising overall quality of life.",Comparative Study,4493.0,18.0,third-generation aromatase inhibitors AIs letrozole anastrozole exemestane replacing tamoxifen adjuvant therapy postmenopausal women early breast AIs demonstrated superior efficacy better overall safety compared tamoxifen randomized controlled trials provide cardioprotective effects tamoxifen bone loss concern long-term adjuvant use Patients require regular bone mineral density monitoring prophylactic bisphosphonates evaluated determine protect long-term bone health AIs decrease risks thromboembolic cerebrovascular events compared tamoxifen overall rate cardiovascular events patients treated AIs range seen age-matched non-breast-cancer populations AIs associated lower incidence endometrial fewer vaginal bleeding/discharge events tamoxifen Compared tamoxifen incidence hot flashes lower anastrozole letrozole higher exemestane Generally adverse events AIs predictable manageable tamoxifen associated life-threatening events minority patients Overall benefits AIs tamoxifen achieved compromising overall quality life,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1282, 914, 2106, 222, 3826, 2800, 3571, 2, 3199, 32, 9574, 1105, 22, 249, 36, 4, 96, 1679, 117, 5, 191, 12, 242, 3826, 47, 264, 1123, 209, 2, 380, 63, 367, 72, 5, 1105, 4, 384, 1149, 143, 491, 68, 44, 377, 3, 17618, 176, 1, 1105, 2, 407, 68, 40, 8, 2893, 5, 136, 319, 337, 249, 119, 7, 1353, 3316, 5033, 1263, 1315, 2, 1862, 4354, 32, 486, 194, 6, 223, 317, 491, 68, 4869, 319, 337, 341, 3826, 775, 3, 1098, 1, 4703, 2, 9261, 281, 72, 5, 1105, 2, 3, 63, 116, 1, 2179, 281, 4, 7, 73, 5, 3826, 16, 262, 3, 184, 527, 4, 89, 655, 220, 1678, 12, 1184, 3826, 32, 120, 41, 5, 8, 280, 287, 1, 12, 2, 1497, 2294, 2993, 281, 76, 1105, 72, 5, 1105, 3, 287, 1, 2859, 4193, 16, 280, 5, 3571, 2, 2800, 84, 68, 40, 142, 5, 3199, 1228, 290, 281, 5, 3826, 32, 7639, 2, 2808, 547, 1105, 68, 40, 41, 5, 358, 3691, 281, 4, 8, 2652, 1, 7, 63, 3, 1141, 1, 3826, 252, 1105, 32, 513, 187, 6102, 63, 372, 1, 358]",1316.0,17912638,Safety aromatase inhibitors adjuvant setting,2,0.010050251256281407
A cost-effective analysis of adjuvant therapies for the treatment of stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-10-22,"Recent surveys have indicated that four alternatives are employed for adjuvant treatment of stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma: observation (OBS), high dose rate vaginal brachytherapy (VB), whole pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), or a combination of pelvic external beam with vaginal brachytherapy (COMB). Our goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these alternatives for management of stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma. We designed a decision analysis model comparing the four possible treatments in terms of their utility and cost. We reviewed the existing literature and utilized published data to estimate complication and recurrence rates from each treatment option. We obtained cost data from a chart review of patients treated with each approach at a single institution between 1995 and 2005. OBS yielded the lowest expected cost, $437 million per 100,000 women. COMB yielded the highest cost, at $2.93 billion per 100,000 women. VB yielded the highest 5-year quality adjusted survival, 86%. In a population of 100,000 women, VB would result in an additional 8200 quality adjusted survivors compared to OBS, at a cost of $65,900 per survivor. In contrast, EBRT and COMB result in either fewer survivors and/or greater costs when compared to OBS or VB. Routine use of adjuvant EBRT or COMB in the management of surgical stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma is not cost-effective. Compared to OBS, post-operative VB improves survival at a cost of $65,900 per survivor, supporting further investigation of this adjuvant therapy.",Journal Article,4474.0,21.0,"Recent surveys indicated alternatives employed adjuvant treatment stage endometrial adenocarcinoma observation OBS high dose rate vaginal brachytherapy VB pelvic external beam radiotherapy EBRT combination pelvic external beam vaginal brachytherapy COMB goal evaluate cost-effectiveness alternatives management stage endometrial adenocarcinoma designed decision model comparing possible treatments terms utility cost reviewed existing literature utilized published estimate complication recurrence rates treatment option obtained cost chart review patients treated approach single institution 1995 2005 OBS yielded lowest expected cost 437 million 100,000 women COMB yielded highest cost 2.93 billion 100,000 women VB yielded highest 5-year quality adjusted survival 86 population 100,000 women VB additional 8200 quality adjusted survivors compared OBS cost 65,900 survivor contrast EBRT COMB fewer survivors and/or greater costs compared OBS VB Routine use adjuvant EBRT COMB management surgical stage endometrial adenocarcinoma cost-effective Compared OBS post-operative VB improves survival cost 65,900 survivor supporting investigation adjuvant therapy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[435, 3666, 47, 1103, 17, 294, 6295, 32, 2516, 9, 249, 24, 1, 82, 70, 449, 1664, 10291, 64, 61, 116, 1536, 9464, 902, 1110, 1455, 1345, 310, 1883, 15, 8, 150, 1, 1110, 1455, 1345, 5, 1536, 22179, 114, 1326, 10, 6, 376, 3, 835, 1236, 1, 46, 6295, 9, 284, 1, 82, 70, 449, 21, 1114, 8, 948, 65, 202, 1430, 3, 294, 899, 640, 4, 1794, 1, 136, 1207, 2, 835, 21, 446, 3, 1692, 789, 2, 2080, 983, 74, 6, 1191, 1447, 2, 146, 151, 29, 296, 24, 1501, 21, 683, 835, 74, 29, 8, 2937, 206, 1, 7, 73, 5, 296, 353, 28, 8, 226, 731, 59, 2323, 2, 1242, 10291, 2178, 3, 2101, 1336, 835, 12592, 3346, 379, 394, 984, 117, 22179, 2178, 3, 1076, 835, 28, 18, 966, 10243, 379, 394, 984, 117, 9464, 2178, 3, 1076, 33, 111, 372, 586, 25, 868, 4, 8, 266, 1, 394, 984, 117, 9464, 688, 757, 4, 35, 402, 44904, 372, 586, 332, 72, 6, 10291, 28, 8, 835, 1, 556, 5310, 379, 2628, 4, 748, 1883, 2, 22179, 757, 4, 361, 1497, 332, 2, 15, 378, 1201, 198, 72, 6, 10291, 15, 9464, 1311, 119, 1, 249, 1883, 15, 22179, 4, 3, 284, 1, 221, 82, 70, 449, 16, 44, 835, 323, 72, 6, 10291, 539, 1208, 9464, 1804, 25, 28, 8, 835, 1, 556, 5310, 379, 2628, 1912, 195, 940, 1, 26, 249, 36]",1458.0,17936341,cost-effective adjuvant therapies treatment stage endometrial adenocarcinoma,0,0.0
Intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer: a review of complications and completion rates.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-11-07,"Intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy has a clear survival advantage in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, but the high rate of complications has discouraged widespread acceptance. The purpose of this study was to review the completion rate of patients receiving i.p. chemotherapy as first line treatment at a single institution and determine what factors prohibit completion of therapy. Patients receiving i.p. chemotherapy from 1993 to 2006 were identified by hospital registries for a retrospective review. Charts were abstracted for patient demographics, clinical and pathologic findings, surgical intervention, treatment modalities, and toxicity. Eighty-three patients were identified who received front line treatment with i.p. chemotherapy. All patients received a platinum and taxane agent. Port placement (single lumen, venous access device) was completed at time of cytoreductive surgery (33%, n=27) or by mini-laparotomy (67%, n=56). Fifty patients (60%) completed a minimum of 6 cycles of treatment with a mean of 5 cycles. Eleven patients (13%) discontinued treatment due to catheter-related complications including infection (n=4), access difficulties (n=3), grade 4 abdominal pain (n=1), port leaking (n=1), and development of a peritoneal-vaginal fistula (n=1). Sixteen patients (19%) did not complete i.p. treatment because of chemotherapy-related toxicity.

Summary of aromatase inhibitor clinical trials in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-02-01,"Five years of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen was considered the gold-standard treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer for many years. Data from a core group of clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have challenged this perception. These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), 2) in a ""switched setting"" after 2 to 3 years of treatment with tamoxifen (Arimidex-Nolvadex 95, the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 8 [ABCSG 8] trial, the Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole study, the Intergroup Exemestane Study), and 3) in extended settings (National Cancer Institute of Canada Trial MA.17, ABCSG 6a, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project 33). The efficacy data from these studies suggested that AIs have added substantial benefit in terms of disease outcome. AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. However, patients who received tamoxifen had less skeletal events and accelerated bone resorption compared with women who received AIs. AIs should be considered when planning a patient's endocrine therapy, taking into account the differences in tolerability and end-organ effects of the classes of endocrine therapy. Outstanding issues to optimize AI therapy include identifying the optimal duration, agent, and patients for these therapies.",Journal Article,4372.0,40.0,years adjuvant therapy tamoxifen considered gold-standard treatment postmenopausal women estrogen receptor-positive breast years core group clinical trials investigating safety efficacy aromatase inhibitors AIs challenged perception studies designed evaluate safety efficacy AIs following clinical settings 1 initial adjuvant therapy Arimidex Tamoxifen Combination trial Breast International Group Trial 1-98 2 `` switched setting '' 2 3 years treatment tamoxifen Arimidex-Nolvadex 95 Austrian Breast Colorectal Group 8 ABCSG 8 trial Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole Intergroup Exemestane 3 extended settings National Institute Canada Trial MA.17 ABCSG 6a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project 33 efficacy studies suggested AIs added substantial benefit terms disease outcome AIs tolerated patients received experienced fewer thrombolic events endometrial hot flashes night sweats vaginal bleeding compared patients receive tamoxifen patients received tamoxifen skeletal events accelerated bone resorption compared women received AIs AIs considered planning patient 's endocrine therapy taking account differences tolerability end-organ effects classes endocrine therapy Outstanding issues optimize AI therapy include identifying optimal duration agent patients therapies,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[365, 60, 1, 249, 36, 5, 1105, 10, 515, 3, 4159, 260, 24, 9, 1679, 117, 5, 808, 153, 109, 12, 9, 445, 60, 74, 29, 8, 1793, 87, 1, 38, 143, 3103, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 2106, 222, 3826, 47, 6389, 26, 4886, 46, 94, 11, 1114, 6, 376, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 3826, 4, 3, 366, 38, 1947, 14, 22, 388, 249, 36, 3, 17131, 1105, 279, 15, 4, 150, 160, 944, 87, 160, 14, 1096, 18, 4, 8, 7883, 546, 522, 50, 18, 6, 27, 60, 1, 24, 5, 1105, 17131, 43328, 48, 3, 22455, 2, 12, 45, 87, 66, 34390, 66, 160, 3, 10215, 1105, 3571, 45, 3, 4839, 3199, 45, 2, 27, 4, 1747, 1947, 657, 12, 1377, 1, 4740, 160, 3687, 269, 34390, 9193, 657, 221, 249, 2, 1659, 3105, 466, 3, 209, 74, 29, 46, 94, 1148, 17, 3826, 47, 1953, 1281, 247, 4, 1794, 1, 34, 228, 3826, 11, 421, 149, 2, 7, 54, 103, 1370, 592, 1497, 56748, 281, 2, 299, 12, 2859, 4193, 8955, 13298, 2, 2294, 72, 5, 7, 54, 560, 1105, 137, 7, 54, 103, 1105, 42, 299, 2621, 281, 2, 2241, 8143, 72, 5, 117, 54, 103, 3826, 3826, 257, 40, 515, 198, 1349, 8, 69, 292, 1293, 36, 2727, 237, 1967, 3, 362, 4, 1543, 2, 396, 1259, 176, 1, 3, 3211, 1, 1293, 36, 14565, 1553, 6, 2465, 2247, 36, 643, 1386, 3, 665, 654, 420, 2, 7, 9, 46, 235]",1617.0,18072256,Summary aromatase inhibitor clinical trials postmenopausal women early breast,4,0.020100502512562814
Cytologic findings after fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-02-01,"Radical trachelectomy is a surgical procedure intended to preserve fertility in patients with early-stage cervical carcinoma in which the cervix is amputated in continuity with the parametrium and upper vagina, thereby sparing the uterus and adnexa. Follow-up is performed with periodic cytology specimens. The objective of the current study was to analyze the cytologic findings after this novel procedure. Isthmic and vaginal Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep cytology specimens taken from patients after radical vaginal and abdominal trachelectomy were reviewed. The specimens were also analyzed for the presence of benign endocervical cells, lower uterine segment glandular cells, endometrial stromal cells, and endometrial cells. The findings were correlated with the original diagnosis and follow-up, which included subsequent cytology specimens and biopsies. Cytology specimens (n = 223) from 44 patients were included in this study. An endometrial component was identified in 131 of the cases (59%). Twenty-eight cases were diagnosed as abnormal in the original cytology examination. Twenty of these cases and 5 additional cases that were diagnosed cytologically as benign had subsequent biopsies. The biopsies confirmed the presence of a lesion in only 4 of 25 biopsies (3 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma). All cases diagnosed as atypical glandular cells represented tubal metaplasia, lower uterine segment glandular cells, or endometrial stromal cells. Cytology specimens after trachelectomy frequently contain glandular cells from the lower uterine segment epithelium or endometrial stromal cells, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance. Tubal metaplasia is also a potential pitfall in these specimens.

Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node detection in women with vaginal cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-01-10,"To determine the patterns of lymphatic drainage from primary vaginal cancers utilizing lymphoscintigraphy and to determine if this clinical information would affect treatment planning. For women with newly diagnosed vaginal cancer, pretreatment lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node identification were performed using lymphoscintigraphy. In patients who underwent surgery, sentinel lymph nodes were identified intraoperatively using radiocolloid and patent blue dye. The impact of pretreatment lymphoscintigraphy findings on radiation planning in women who received radiation as initial treatment was noted. Fourteen women were enrolled during the study period. At least 1 sentinel lymph node was identified on pretreatment lymphoscintigraphy in 11 patients (79%). The median number of sentinel nodes found per patient was 2, and bilateral sentinel nodes were found in 6 (55%) of the 11 patients with sentinel nodes identified. Among these 11 patients, 5 (45%) had sentinel nodes identified in the groin only, 4 (36%) had sentinel nodes identified in the pelvis only, and 2 (18%) had sentinel nodes identified in both the groin and the pelvis. No relationship was observed between sentinel lymph node location and primary tumor histologic subtype or location. Three (33%) of the 9 women treated initially with radiation therapy had their radiation field altered as a result of the lymphoscintigraphy findings. In women with vaginal cancer, lymphatic drainage from the primary lesion does not always follow the lymphatic channels that would have been predicted anatomically.

Uterine tumors with neuroectodermal differentiation: a series of 17 cases and review of the literature.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2008-02-01,"Uterine tumors with neuroectodermal differentiation, frequently referred to as primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), are uncommon. The clinicopathologic features of 17 such cases reviewed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) are presented along with a review of the literature. All of the pathology material was reviewed at MDACC, and in all cases, immunohistochemistry contributed to the diagnosis. In 12 cases, in situ hybridization techniques were used to determine whether a rearrangement of the EWSR1 gene, required for a diagnosis of peripheral PNET, was present. Clinical information was obtained from a patient chart review. Ages ranged from 31 to 81 years (median 58). Clinical presentations included vaginal bleeding (9), back pain (1), presumed fibroids (2), pelvic mass (1), incidental finding at hysterectomy (1), and unknown (3). Twelve patients had surgery or imaging to determine stage: I (2), II (0), III (6), and IV (4). Five patients had biopsy only. Ten tumors had only neuroectodermal components. In 7 tumors, the neuroectodermal component was admixed with an additional component including unclassified sarcoma (2 cases), rhabdomyosarcoma, endometrioid carcinoma, adenosarcoma and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (2 cases). Follow-up, available for 13 patients, ranged from 2 to 41 months with 7 patients dead of disease 2 to 26 months after diagnosis. Six patients are alive with no evidence of disease after follow-up ranging from 6 to 41 months. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Results for the most commonly used immunohistochemistry studies include cytokeratin, 13/15 tumors negative (2 focally positive); synaptophysin, 15/16 tumors positive; neurofilament, 10/11 tumors positive; and CD99, 7/9 tumors positive (2 tumors had nonspecific cytoplasmic staining). None of the 12 tumors tested had a detectable rearrangement in the EWSR1 gene. Uterine tumors with neuroectodermal differentiation, similar to more common endometrial malignancies, tend to occur in postmenopausal women and frequently present with vaginal bleeding. An immunohistochemistry panel including cytokeratin, neurofilament, synaptophysin, and CD99 can highlight neuroectodermal differentiation and identify tumors for which molecular testing should be considered.

Applying a conceptual model for examining health-related quality of life in long-term breast cancer survivors: CALGB study 79804.,Psycho-oncology,Psychooncology,2008-11-01,"The Survivor's Health and Reaction study used a quality-of-life model adapted for cancer survivors by Dow and colleagues to identify factors related to global health-related quality of life (HRQL) and to document the prevalence of problems and health-oriented behaviors in a follow-up study of breast cancer patients who participated in CALGB 8541. A total of 245 survivors (78% of those invited) who were 9.4-16.5 years post-diagnosis completed surveys that inquired about current HRQL, economic, spiritual, physical and psychosocial concerns, and health-oriented behaviors (e.g. smoking, exercise, and supplement use). A regression model was developed to examine factors related to global HRQL across all domains. The regression model revealed that decreased energy levels (odds ratio (OR)=1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.07), having heart disease (OR=5.01, 95% CI: 1.39, 18.1), having two or more co-morbidities (OR=2.39, 95% CI: 1.10, 5.19), and lower social support (OR=1.03, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.05) were associated with lower global HRQL. Factors related to psychological, spiritual, and economic domains were not predictive of global HRQL. Regarding lifestyle changes, some women reported engaging in health-oriented behaviors since their cancer diagnosis, such as improving eating habits (54%), increasing exercise (32%), and reducing/quitting smoking (20%). The most prevalent problems reported by women at follow-up were menopausal symptoms (64%), such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness, osteoporosis (25%), and lymphedema (23%).

What is the incidence of isolated paraaortic nodal recurrence in grade 1 endometrial carcinoma?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-07-26,"To describe the incidence of isolated paraaortic nodal recurrences in patients with a final diagnosis of grade 1 endometrial carcinoma initially treated with surgery. Records from a prospectively maintained endometrial carcinoma database were reviewed to identify sites of recurrence. Patients with any papillary serous or clear cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma, squamous carcinoma, or adenosarcoma were excluded. Recurrence sites were classified into 4 main categories: 1) pelvic (including vaginal and other soft tissue pelvic sites); 2) abdominal (including peritoneum, omentum and liver); 3) distant (including lung, brain, supraclavicular, and groins); and 4) isolated paraaortic nodal recurrence (including any nodal recurrence between the midcommon iliac to renal vessels). Between 1/93 and 5/06, 1453 patients with endometrial carcinoma met the study inclusion criteria. Final grade distribution included: grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma, 310 (21%); grade 2, 578 (40%); grade 3, 481 (33%); and incomplete, 84 (5.8%). In all, 154 patients (11%) had documented recurrences. Recurrence sites for all patients/all grades included: pelvis, 52 (34%); abdomen, 51 (33%); distant, 41 (27%), and isolated paraaortic, 10 (6%).

Radical trachelectomy for cervical cancer: postoperative physical and emotional adjustment concerns.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-07-26,"To investigate the incidence of cervical stenosis and related emotional and sexual adjustment concerns in women treated with radical trachelectomy. Prospective data of 30 stage I cervical cancer patients enrolled in an ongoing study were evaluated in combination with a medical chart review. Eight patients (27%) did not have any stenosis of the neo-cervix postoperatively; 10 (33%) had clinically notable stenosis not requiring neo-cervical dilation to allow adequate sampling; moreover, 12 (40%) had sufficient stenosis requiring a neo-cervical dilation procedure, which proved to be safe and useful. The majority of the dilation procedures (n=8) were conducted under local anesthesia in the office. At preoperative baseline survey, women reported a high rate of sexual inactivity. Fear of intercourse and dyspareunia were reported prior to surgery; however, trends of adjustment and improvement were noted over time postoperatively. Overall, fear of sexual activity tended to lessen if the degree of dyspareunia decreased over time. Postoperative dyspareunia decreased over time, which could have been associated with the mechanical stretching due to vaginal dilator use or dilating benefit of intercourse. Postoperative concerns associated with radical trachelectomy may be greater than what has been reported in the literature; however, several adjustment trends were noted with intermediate/long-term follow-up. Office cervical dilation is a simple procedure, which is helpful in the management of neo-cervical stenosis.

Oncologic outcome of fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy versus radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 cervical carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-08-27,"To compare the oncologic outcomes of women who underwent a fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy (RT) to those who underwent a radical hysterectomy (RH) for stage IB1 cervical carcinoma. We performed a case-control study of all patients with stage IB1 cervical carcinoma who underwent a vaginal or abdominal RT between 11/01 and 6/07. The control group consisted of patients with stage IB1 disease who underwent an RH between 11/91 and 6/07 and who would be considered candidates for fertility-sparing surgery. Information was extracted from a prospectively acquired database. Recurrence-free and disease-specific survival (RFS and DSS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared with the log-rank test where indicated. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression method. Forty stage IB1 patients underwent an RT and 110 patients underwent an RH. There were no statistical differences between the two groups for the following prognostic variables: histology, median number of lymph nodes removed, node positive rate, lymph-vascular space involvement (LVSI), or deep stromal invasion (DSI). The median follow-up for the entire group was 44 months. The 5-year RFS rate was 96% (for the RT group compared to 86% for the RH group (P=NS). On multivariate analysis in this group of stage IB1 lesions, tumor size <2 cm was not an independent predictor of outcome, but both LVSI and DSI retained independent predictive value (P=0.033 and 0.005, respectively). For selected patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer, fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy appears to have a similar oncologic outcome to radical hysterectomy.

Radical vaginal versus abdominal trachelectomy for stage IB1 cervical cancer: a comparison of surgical and pathologic outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-10-29,"To compare the surgical and pathologic outcomes utilizing two surgical approaches for fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy in patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer. A prospectively maintained database of vaginal radical trachelectomy (VRT) and abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) procedures was analyzed. All procedures were performed in a standardized manner by the same surgical group. Parametrial measurements were recorded from the final pathology report. Standard statistical tests were used. Between 12/2001 and 7/2007, 43 adult patients with FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer underwent surgery with the intent to perform a fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy. VRT was attempted in 28 patients (65%) and ART in 15 patients (35%). The median measured parametrial length in the VRT group was 1.45 cm compared to 3.97 cm in the ART group, P<0.0001. None of the parametrial specimens in the VRT group contained parametrial nodes. Parametrial nodes were detected in 8 (57.3%) of the ART specimens (P=0.0002). There was no difference in histologic subtypes, lymph vascular space invasion, or median total regional lymph nodes removed in the two groups.

The mean age was 67 years old (range, 53-80 years). Surgery consisted of hysterectomy (TAH/BSO, 64%, LAVH/BSO, 36%), peritoneal washing, omental biopsy, and pelvic lymph-node dissection (median 14 nodes). Para-aortic node sampling was done in 88% (median, 6). IVRT median dose was 21 Gy (range, 18-21 Gy, in 3 fractions) and concurrent CT consisted of carboplatin to AUC=5 and taxol to 175 mg/m(2) given every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. CT was well tolerated with 22/25 (88%) receiving 6 cycles. Three patients received <or=5 cycles; 2 owing to physician preference (3 and 4 cycles) and 1 owing to toxicity (5 cycles).

Symptom management in premenopausal patients with breast cancer.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2008-10-01,"Women with breast cancer have many adverse symptoms, of which some are specific to premenopausal patients. Management of these common symptoms include non-hormonal drugs, such as antidepressants and antiseizure compounds to alleviate hot flushes. Non-oestrogenic vaginal lubricants seem to moderately decrease occurrence of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Transdermal testosterone alone has not been shown to improve libido in these women. Options for fertility preservation include cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes before chemotherapy. Exercise is the one evidenced-based intervention shown to positively affect cancer-related fatigue. However, effective prevention and treatments for peripheral neuropathy and paclitaxel acute pain syndrome remain elusive. Weight-bearing exercise helps to maintain bone strength with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. Use of bisphosphonates in women taking aromatase inhibitors (combined with ovarian suppression in premenopausal women) to prevent bone fractures has not been substantiated, although it should be considered in women with osteoporosis.

Oncol.,2009-01-01,"To determine recurrence patterns and survival outcomes of stage II uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) patients treated by various modalities with an emphasis on carboplatin/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy (CT)+/-radiotherapy (RT). A retrospective, multi-institution study of women with stage II UPSC diagnosed from 1992 to 2006 was performed. All patients underwent comprehensive surgical staging. Treatment included observation (OBS), RT (vaginal brachytherapy, whole pelvic and/or whole abdominal therapy), or >or=3 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel alone or with RT. Recurrence and survival outcomes were determined. We identified 55 subjects: 10 treated with OBS, 26 with RT alone and 19 with CT+/-RT. After a median follow-up of 33 mos (range, 10-119), 20 recurrences (36%) were observed. There was an overall difference in recurrence based upon treatment (p=.013). Specifically, all CT+/-RT treated patients had a lower risk of recurrence (11%) compared to patients treated by RT alone (50%) or OBS (50%). No patients treated with both CT+RT (n=12) experienced a recurrence. Treatment with CT was also associated with a decreased risk of recurrence on multivariate analysis (p=.015). Most recurrences were extra-pelvic (70%), occurred within 2 years (85%) and were not salvageable (84%). Five-year progression-free survival was 86% in chemotherapy-treated patients versus 41% in those not receiving chemotherapy (p=.010); overall survival was 88% in chemotherapy-treated patients versus 64% in those not receiving chemotherapy (p=.115).

Phase II trial of bevacizumab in the treatment of persistent or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: a gynecologic oncology group study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-01-12,"Vascular endothelial growth factor is a key promoter of tumor progression in cervical carcinoma. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a phase II trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody. Eligible patients had recurrent cervical cancer, measurable disease, and GOG performance status < or = 2. Treatment consisted of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and toxicity. Forty-six patients were enrolled (median age, 46 years); 38 patients (82.6%) received prior radiation as well as either one (n = 34, 73.9%) or two (n = 12, 26.1%) prior cytotoxic regimens for recurrent disease. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events at least possibly related to bevacizumab included hypertension (n = 7), thrombo-embolism (n = 5), GI (n = 4), anemia (n = 2), other cardiovascular (n = 2), vaginal bleeding (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 1), and fistula (n = 1). One grade 5 infection was observed. Eleven patients (23.9%; two-sided 90% CI, 14% to 37%) survived progression free for at least 6 months, and five patients (10.9%; two-sided 90% CI, 4% to 22%) had partial responses. The median response duration was 6.21 months (range, 2.83 to 8.28 months). The median PFS and overall survival times were 3.40 months (95% CI, 2.53 to 4.53 months) and 7.29 months (95% CI, 6.11 to 10.41 months), respectively.

Maternal health conditions during pregnancy and acute leukemia in children with Down syndrome: A Children's Oncology Group study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-05-01,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) have about a 20-fold increased risk of developing leukemia. Early childhood infections may protect against acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in children with and without DS. We examined whether maternal infections and health conditions during pregnancy were associated with acute leukemia in children with DS. We conducted a case-control study of 158 children with DS and leukemia (including 97 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 61 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and 173 children with DS during the period 1997-2002. Maternal interview included information about 14 maternal conditions during gestation that are likely to induce an inflammatory response. We evaluated their prevalence in cases and controls. Five of these were common enough to allow analyses by leukemia subtype. Vaginal bleeding was the most frequent (18% cases, 25% controls) and was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33-0.99) for all cases combined. Other variables, while showing a potential trend toward reduced risk had effect estimates, which were imprecise and not statistically significant. In contrast, amniocentesis was marginally associated with an increased risk of AML (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.90-4.69).

We present the technique and outcome for a fertility-sparing, radical abdominal trachelectomy in a 12-year-old girl with anaplastic, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma involving the uterine cervix. The patient had presented to our center after the piecemeal resection of a uterine cervical mass; because of concern about microscopic residual disease, we classified her as group II-A according to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study system. Staging studies excluded the presence of distant disease. The patient received 4 cycles of multiagent chemotherapy and then underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy, with removal of the uterine cervix, parametria, vaginal cuff, and regional lymph nodes. Microscopically, the specimen showed treatment effect and no residual tumor. Regional nodes were negative. Radical abdominal trachelectomy, which has not been previously reported for rhabdomyosarcoma, has appeared to secure local disease control in this case while preserving the patient's future fertility potential.

Role of laparoscopic surgery in the management of endometrial cancer.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2009-05-01,"Minimum surgical treatment for endometrial cancer is removal of the uterus. The operative approach to achieve that goal ranges from vaginal hysterectomy alone to laparotomy with radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy with possible omentectomy, and resection of all metastatic disease. Stratifying the risk factors for predicting presence of metastatic disease has error rates exceeding tolerance for many gynecologic oncologists. Most accept routine laparoscopic surgical staging with hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and removal of adnexa as standard care for patients with endometrial cancer. Modifying the extent of surgical staging for low-risk intrauterine findings or excessive risk for postoperative morbidity is also accepted. Laparoscopic surgery has become the ideal initial surgical approach for this disease, allowing for visual inspection of common metastatic sites, biopsy of abnormal areas, and cytology from peritoneal surfaces. The extent of staging can be altered depending on frozen section findings from the uterus, adnexa, and peritoneal surfaces.

Prediagnostic symptoms of ovarian carcinoma: a case-control study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-05-22,"Women with ovarian carcinoma experience poor survival because symptoms are vague and diagnosis is unlikely at an early stage. The objective of this study was to identify a set of symptoms that might assist gynecologists and other clinicians in the diagnosis of localized ovarian carcinoma when treatment is most effective. This population-based case-control study included 432 women, aged 19-88 years, with invasive ovarian carcinoma and 491 controls frequency-matched to cases on age, ethnicity, and interview time. Symptoms data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of symptoms with ovarian carcinoma by stage and histology were estimated using unconditional multiple polytomous logistic regression models. The predictive ability of symptoms was evaluated by comparing the area under receiver operating curves (ROC). The following self-reported symptoms were significantly predictive of localized ovarian carcinoma irrespective of histological type: abdominal pain (ROC=0.81), distended and hard abdomen (ROC=0.83), vaginal bleeding not associated with periods (ROC=0.88), and a palpable abdominal mass (ROC=0.88). Urinary symptoms had low predictive ability, and bowel symptoms and fatigue/loss of appetite were predictive only at advanced stages. The best predictive ability was observed for a 4-symptom index that included abdominal pain, distended and hard abdomen, abdominal mass, and abnormal vaginal bleeding (ROC=0.90 sensitivity=74%; specificity=71%).

Patterns of regional recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for cervical cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-07-04,"To determine the patterns of regional recurrence in patients treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT) for cervical cancer. The records of 198 patients treated with definitive RT for cervical cancer between 1980 and 2000 who experienced a regional recurrence without a central or distal vaginal recurrence were reviewed. All patients received a combination of external-beam RT and intracavitary brachytherapy. In the 180 patients with a documented location of regional recurrence, the relationship between the recurrence and the radiation fields was determined. The median time to regional recurrence was 13 months (range, 2-85 months). Of the 180 patients who had an evaluable regional recurrence, 119 (66%) had a component of marginal failure; 71 patients recurred above-the-field, 2 patients occurred in the inguinal nodes, and 2 patients recurred above-the-field and in the inguinal nodes. In addition, 105 patients (58%) had a component of in-field failure; 59 patients recurred in-field only, 39 patients recurred in-field and above-the-field, 2 patients recurred in-field, above-the-field, and in the inguinal nodes, and 5 patients recurred in-field and in the inguinal nodes. The median survival after regional recurrence was 8 months (range, 0-194 months). Most regional recurrences after definitive RT for cervical cancer include a component of marginal failure, usually immediately superior to the radiation field. These recurrences suggest a deficiency in target volume. Recurrences also occur in-field, suggesting a deficiency in dose.

The expanding use of third-generation aromatase inhibitors: what the general internist needs to know.,Journal of general internal medicine,J Gen Intern Med,2009-11-01,"Breast cancer patients represent the largest group of adult cancer survivors in the US. Most breast cancers in women 50 years of age and older are hormone receptor positive. Third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the newest class of drugs used in treating hormone responsive breast cancer. It is often during start of adjuvant hormone therapy that the breast cancer patient establishes (or reestablishes) close follow-up with their general internist. Given the large numbers of breast cancer patients in the US and the increasing use of third generation AI's, general internists will need to have a clear understanding of these drugs including their benefits and potential harms. Currently there are three third generation aromatase inhibitors FDA approved for use in the US. All have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in disease free survival (DFS) in the treatment of both metastatic and early breast cancers. While the data on side effects is limited, AI (compared to tamoxifen) may result in higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures, more arthralgias, and increased vaginal dryness and dysparuenia. Limited information on their effects on the cardiovascular system and neuro-cognitive function are also available. Patient's receiving adjuvant hormone therapy are generally considered disease free or disease stable and require less intensive monitoring by their breast cancer specialist. In situations where patients experience significant negative side effects from AI therapy, discussions to discontinue treatment (and switch to an alternative endocrine therapy) should involve the cancer specialist and take into consideration the patient's risk for breast cancer recurrence and the impact of therapy on their quality of life. In some cases, patients may choose to never initiate AI treatment. In other cases, patients may choose to prematurely discontinue therapy even if therapy is well tolerated. In both settings increased knowledge by the general internists will likely facilitate discussions of risks versus benefits of therapy and possibly improve compliance to adjuvant hormone therapy.",Journal Article,3733.0,13.0,Breast patients represent largest group adult survivors breast women 50 years age older hormone receptor positive generation aromatase inhibitors AIs newest class drugs treating hormone responsive breast start adjuvant hormone therapy breast patient establishes reestablishes close follow-up general internist Given large numbers breast patients increasing use generation AI 's general internists need clear understanding drugs including benefits potential harms Currently generation aromatase inhibitors FDA approved use shown superior tamoxifen disease free survival DFS treatment metastatic early breast effects limited AI compared tamoxifen higher rates osteoporosis fractures arthralgias increased vaginal dryness dysparuenia Limited information effects cardiovascular neuro-cognitive function available Patient 's receiving adjuvant hormone therapy generally considered disease free disease stable require intensive monitoring breast specialist situations patients experience significant negative effects AI therapy discussions discontinue treatment switch alternative endocrine therapy involve specialist consideration patient 's risk breast recurrence impact therapy quality life cases patients choose initiate AI treatment cases patients choose prematurely discontinue therapy therapy tolerated settings increased knowledge general internists likely facilitate discussions risks versus benefits therapy possibly improve compliance adjuvant hormone therapy,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 7, 1231, 3, 2166, 87, 1, 780, 12, 332, 4, 3, 843, 96, 163, 4, 117, 212, 60, 1, 89, 2, 434, 32, 785, 153, 109, 1282, 914, 2106, 222, 3826, 32, 3, 16850, 1040, 1, 600, 95, 4, 1367, 785, 2443, 12, 192, 16, 629, 190, 2435, 1, 249, 785, 36, 17, 3, 12, 69, 7410, 15, 58338, 2336, 166, 126, 5, 136, 1083, 38401, 447, 3, 375, 1870, 1, 12, 7, 4, 3, 843, 2, 3, 602, 119, 1, 1282, 914, 2247, 292, 1083, 22383, 303, 594, 6, 47, 8, 885, 612, 1, 46, 600, 141, 136, 1141, 2, 174, 6753, 694, 125, 32, 169, 1282, 914, 2106, 222, 2078, 850, 9, 119, 4, 3, 843, 62, 47, 85, 443, 6, 40, 1123, 6, 1105, 4, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 4, 3, 24, 1, 110, 113, 2, 191, 163, 369, 3, 74, 23, 1152, 176, 16, 383, 2247, 72, 6, 1105, 68, 757, 4, 142, 151, 1, 4970, 2, 3909, 80, 13632, 2, 101, 15822, 2, 58339, 383, 487, 23, 136, 176, 23, 3, 2179, 398, 2, 4891, 1863, 343, 32, 120, 390, 69, 292, 357, 249, 785, 36, 32, 1228, 515, 34, 115, 15, 34, 585, 2, 1353, 299, 1686, 1315, 20, 136, 12, 6554, 4, 5990, 1257, 7, 730, 93, 199, 1152, 176, 29, 2247, 36, 3173, 6, 7934, 24, 2, 5096, 6, 35, 1091, 1293, 36, 257, 3882, 3, 12, 6554, 2, 3585, 237, 2415, 3, 69, 292, 43, 9, 12, 146, 2, 3, 345, 1, 36, 23, 136, 372, 1, 358, 4, 476, 140, 7, 68, 6009, 6, 1737, 4565, 2247, 24, 4, 127, 140, 7, 68, 6009, 6, 9771, 7934, 36, 871, 492, 36, 16, 149, 421, 4, 110, 1947, 101, 922, 20, 3, 1083, 22383, 303, 322, 1876, 3173, 1, 1098, 185, 1141, 1, 36, 2, 2150, 401, 3336, 6, 249, 785, 36]",2025.0,19838836,expanding use third-generation aromatase inhibitors general internist needs know,0,0.0
High-dose estrogen as salvage hormonal therapy for highly refractory metastatic breast cancer: a retrospective chart review.,Clinical therapeutics,Clin Ther,2009-01-01,"High-dose estrogens (HDEs) are an efficacious but widely overlooked treatment option for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This is due in part to the introduction of tamoxifen in the 1970s, which was proven to be equivalent in efficacy and associated with fewer adverse events (AEs). The aim of this study was to report our experience with the use of HDE in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Local institutional review board approval was obtained to conduct a retrospective chart review of patients with MBC treated with HDEs at the Boca Raton Comprehensive Cancer Center, Boca Raton, Florida, from 2001 through March 2009. Demographic information, response rates, and tolerability profiles were collected. Of the 426 patients with MBC identified, we found 26 patients with MBC who were prescribed HDEs as a treatment in any line of therapy for advanced breast cancer. The median age at the start of HDE therapy was 59 years (range, 42-92 years). Three of the 26 patients (11.5%) were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive determined via fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. With the exception of 1 patient who had received no prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease, all patients received multiple lines of treatment (both chemotherapy and hormonal treatments) in the advanced setting (median, 7 lines; range, 0-12) prior to the initiation of HDE. Five of 20 patients (25%) with measurable metastatic disease (visceral and/or soft tissue metastases) had objective antitumor responses defined as either a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR). Four additional patients (20%) had prolonged stable disease (SD) for > or =6 months. Three of 6 patients (50%) with nonmeasurable metastatic disease (bone-only) had prolonged SD for > or =6 months. Clinical benefit rate (defined as CR + PR + SD > or =6 months) for all patients was 46% (12/26), with a median duration of 10 months. Overall median progression-free survival for the 26 subjects was 5 months. Median survival from the start of HDE was 17 months (range, 3-54 months). AEs included fluid retention (8 [31%]), vaginal bleeding (7 [27%]), and nausea (4 [15%]). Two patients discontinued therapy after 1 month.

Symptom presentation in invasive ovarian carcinoma by tumor histological type and grade in a multiethnic population: a case analysis.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-06-29,"Although the majority of women with ovarian carcinoma report symptoms prior to diagnosis, little is known about comparative symptom presentation by histological type, stage, grade, or ethnicity. We conducted a population-based study including 622 women with invasive ovarian carcinoma diagnosed from 1993 to 2008. Epidemiological and symptom data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Symptoms established as significant predictors of ovarian carcinoma were examined in relation to patient and tumor characteristics, using unconditional multivariate logistic regression and general linear models. Symptom presentation and duration differed significantly among women with ovarian carcinoma by stage, tumor histology, and grade, but not ethnicity. Significant differences were observed by histology in reporting a distended abdomen, abnormal vaginal bleeding, and bowel symptoms. Compared to women diagnosed with serous carcinoma, women with mucinous tumors were 2.6 times more likely to report a distended abdomen; women with endometrioid carcinoma were three times more likely to report abnormal bleeding. Women with serous tumors were significantly more likely to report bowel symptoms than were women diagnosed with other histological types. The majority of women with serous tumors were diagnosed with advanced cancer and had shorter duration of symptoms than women with early stage disease. In contrast, women with mucinous tumors were generally diagnosed at an early stage and had longer duration of symptoms (p=0.009) if diagnosed at an advanced stage. The study provides evidence that the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer is largely determined by tumor histological type.",Journal Article,3493.0,12.0,majority women ovarian carcinoma report symptoms prior diagnosis little known comparative symptom presentation histological type stage grade ethnicity conducted population-based including 622 women invasive ovarian carcinoma diagnosed 1993 2008 Epidemiological symptom collected interviewer-administered questionnaire Symptoms established significant predictors ovarian carcinoma examined relation patient characteristics unconditional multivariate logistic regression general linear models Symptom presentation duration differed significantly women ovarian carcinoma stage histology grade ethnicity Significant differences observed histology reporting distended abdomen abnormal vaginal bleeding bowel symptoms Compared women diagnosed serous carcinoma women mucinous 2.6 times likely report distended abdomen women endometrioid carcinoma times likely report abnormal bleeding Women serous significantly likely report bowel symptoms women diagnosed histological types majority women serous diagnosed advanced shorter duration symptoms women early stage disease contrast women mucinous generally diagnosed early stage longer duration symptoms p=0.009 diagnosed advanced stage provides evidence early diagnosis ovarian largely determined histological type,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 3, 686, 1, 117, 5, 134, 414, 507, 324, 6, 147, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 2352, 934, 1031, 20, 1831, 267, 82, 88, 15, 2091, 21, 426, 8, 266, 90, 45, 141, 11011, 117, 5, 416, 134, 265, 29, 3343, 6, 1375, 4614, 2, 934, 74, 11, 786, 75, 35, 22543, 468, 1770, 507, 635, 22, 93, 674, 1, 134, 11, 409, 4, 2191, 6, 69, 2, 30, 374, 75, 6438, 331, 812, 320, 2, 1083, 1646, 274, 934, 1031, 2, 654, 2512, 97, 107, 117, 5, 134, 20, 82, 30, 784, 2, 88, 84, 44, 2091, 93, 362, 11, 164, 20, 784, 4, 1760, 8, 26178, 4036, 1668, 2294, 2, 1659, 507, 72, 6, 117, 265, 5, 1744, 134, 117, 5, 2391, 57, 11, 18, 49, 1072, 80, 322, 6, 414, 8, 26178, 4036, 117, 5, 3151, 134, 11, 169, 1072, 80, 322, 6, 414, 1668, 2294, 117, 5, 1744, 57, 11, 97, 80, 322, 6, 414, 1659, 507, 76, 11, 117, 265, 5, 127, 1831, 630, 3, 686, 1, 117, 5, 1744, 57, 11, 265, 5, 131, 12, 2, 42, 985, 654, 1, 507, 76, 117, 5, 191, 82, 34, 4, 748, 117, 5, 2391, 57, 11, 1228, 265, 28, 35, 191, 82, 2, 42, 589, 654, 1, 507, 19, 13, 2376, 492, 265, 28, 35, 131, 82, 3, 45, 777, 241, 17, 3, 191, 147, 1, 12, 16, 1733, 509, 20, 30, 1831, 267]",1631.0,20591474,Symptom presentation invasive ovarian carcinoma histological type grade multiethnic population case,0,0.0
Rate of vaginal cuff separation following laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-09-24,"Vaginal cuff separation is a rare but serious complication following hysterectomy. The goal of our study was to determine the rate of vaginal cuff separation and associated risk factors in patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy. We retrospectively identified patients who underwent a minimally invasive simple or radical hysterectomy at one institution between January 2000 and 2009. Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and multiple logistic regression were used to determine associations between variables and increased risk of separation. A total of 417 patients underwent laparoscopic (n=285) or robotic (n=132) hysterectomy during the study period. Three hundred and sixty-two underwent simple hysterectomy (249 laparoscopic, 113 robotic) and 57 underwent radical hysterectomy (36 laparoscopic, 19 robotic). Seven (1.7%) patients developed a cuff complication and all had a diagnosis of malignancy. Three (1.1%) patients in the laparoscopy group suffered a vaginal cuff evisceration (n=2) or separation (n=1). Four patients in the robotic group (3.0%) had a vaginal evisceration (n=1) or separation (n=3). There was no difference based on surgical approach (p=0.22). Vaginal cuff complications were 9.46-fold higher among patients who had a radical hysterectomy (p<0.01). Median time to presentation of vaginal cuff complication was 128 days (range, 58-175) in the laparoscopy group and 37 days (range, 32-44) in the robotic group. The overall risk of vaginal cuff complication was 1.7%. There appears to be no difference in cuff complication rates based on surgical approach.

Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) after radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies: a clinically recalcitrant entity.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-01-01,"Vaginal dysplasia is associated with prior radiation therapy (RT) for gynecologic malignancies. We reviewed our institution's experience with VAIN in patients who were treated with radiation therapy for a gynecologic malignancy. A retrospective review of patients treated for VAIN was performed. All cases of patients followed and treated for VAIN after radiation therapy were identified (n=10), along with a cohort of patients with VAIN who did not have radiation therapy (n=23). Mean follow-up after initial diagnosis of VAIN was 37.6 months (range: 12 to 72). Cytologic screening events after diagnosis of VAIN (n=105) showed that patients with prior RT were more than twice as likely to have recurrent dysplasia (OR 3.625, 95% CI=from 1.454 to 9.0376) after treatment. Of patients who recurred, the mean time to first recurrence was 12.3 months in cases and 15.3 months in controls, which was not statistically significant (p=0.31). Screening practices at our institution ranged from 3 month to 12 month intervals. 3 patients in the RT group and 1 patient in the control group developed invasive squamous cell cancer of the vagina. Vaginal dysplasia after radiation therapy is more refractory to treatment than dysplasia not associated with radiation therapy, more likely to recur after surgical and ablative therapy, and may also be more likely to progress to invasive cancer.

Phys.,2010-11-17,"To evaluate variations in bladder and rectal volume and the position of the vaginal vault during a 5-week course of pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after hysterectomy. Twenty-four patients were instructed how to fill their bladders before simulation and treatment. These patients underwent computed tomography simulations with full and empty bladders and then underwent rescanning twice weekly during IMRT; patients were asked to have full bladder for treatment. Bladder and rectal volumes and the positions of vaginal fiducial markers were determined, and changes in volume and position were calculated. The mean full and empty bladder volumes at simulation were 480 cc (range, 122-1,052) and 155 cc (range, 49-371), respectively. Bladder volumes varied widely during IMRT: the median difference between the maximum and minimum volumes was 247 cc (range, 96-585). Variations in rectal volume during IMRT were less pronounced. For the 16 patients with vaginal fiducial markers in place throughout IMRT, the median maximum movement of the markers during IMRT was 0.59 cm in the right-left direction (range, 0-0.9), 1.46 cm in the anterior-posterior direction (range, 0.8-2.79), and 1.2 cm in the superior-inferior direction (range, 0.6-2.1). Large variations in rectal or bladder volume frequently correlated with significant displacement of the vaginal apex. Although treatment with a full bladder is usually preferred because of greater sparing of small bowel, our data demonstrate that even with detailed instruction, patients are unable to maintain consistent bladder filling. Variations in organ position during IMRT can result in marked changes in the position of the target volume and the volume of small bowel exposed to high doses of radiation.",Journal Article,3352.0,43.0,"evaluate variations bladder rectal volume position vaginal vault 5-week course pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT hysterectomy Twenty-four patients instructed bladders simulation treatment patients underwent computed tomography simulations bladders underwent rescanning twice weekly IMRT patients asked bladder treatment Bladder rectal volumes positions vaginal fiducial markers determined changes volume position calculated mean bladder volumes simulation 480 cc range 122-1,052 155 cc range 49-371 respectively Bladder volumes varied widely IMRT median difference maximum minimum volumes 247 cc range 96-585 Variations rectal volume IMRT pronounced 16 patients vaginal fiducial markers place IMRT median maximum movement markers IMRT 0.59 cm right-left direction range 0-0.9 1.46 cm anterior-posterior direction range 0.8-2.79 1.2 cm superior-inferior direction range 0.6-2.1 Large variations rectal bladder volume frequently correlated significant displacement vaginal apex treatment bladder usually preferred greater sparing small bowel demonstrate detailed instruction patients unable maintain consistent bladder filling Variations organ position IMRT marked changes position target volume volume small bowel exposed high doses radiation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[6, 376, 2293, 4, 2, 433, 2, 3, 3559, 1, 3, 28115, 190, 8, 33, 647, 906, 1, 1110, 837, 1757, 121, 36, 964, 50, 2622, 737, 294, 7, 11, 17184, 832, 6, 11476, 136, 19442, 348, 4026, 2, 24, 46, 7, 208, 1220, 872, 7490, 5, 1647, 2, 9436, 19442, 2, 818, 208, 25083, 936, 709, 190, 964, 7, 11, 3732, 6, 47, 1647, 9, 24, 2, 2225, 2, 3, 7134, 1, 8416, 525, 11, 509, 2, 400, 4, 433, 2, 3559, 11, 981, 3, 313, 1647, 2, 9436, 2225, 28, 4026, 11, 9108, 1951, 184, 3285, 14, 9194, 2, 3735, 1951, 184, 739, 9196, 106, 2225, 2051, 1792, 190, 964, 3, 52, 523, 59, 3, 689, 2, 2499, 2225, 10, 7708, 1951, 184, 921, 15351, 2293, 4, 433, 190, 964, 11, 299, 3517, 9, 3, 245, 7, 5, 8416, 525, 4, 3536, 2432, 964, 3, 52, 689, 7950, 1, 3, 525, 190, 964, 10, 13, 728, 494, 4, 3, 1913, 1712, 4651, 184, 13, 13, 83, 14, 641, 494, 4, 3, 2882, 3028, 4651, 184, 13, 66, 18, 842, 2, 14, 18, 494, 4, 3, 1123, 1663, 4651, 184, 13, 49, 18, 14, 375, 2293, 4, 15, 433, 746, 438, 5, 93, 6850, 1, 3, 8670, 242, 24, 5, 8, 1647, 16, 2082, 2514, 408, 1, 378, 1851, 1, 302, 1659, 114, 74, 608, 17, 871, 5, 2455, 19661, 7, 32, 4253, 6, 3040, 925, 13930, 2293, 4, 1259, 3559, 190, 964, 122, 757, 4, 2003, 400, 4, 3, 3559, 1, 3, 283, 433, 2, 3, 433, 1, 302, 1659, 2234, 6, 64, 415, 1, 121]",1608.0,21093170,Vaginal motion bladder rectal volumes pelvic intensity-modulated radiation therapy hysterectomy,2,0.010050251256281407
Primary malignant melanoma of the vagina.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2010-12-01,"To describe the clinical and pathologic features of vaginal melanoma and to determine predictors of outcome in patients with this disease. Thirty-seven women with clinical and radiographic stage I vaginal melanoma treated at one institution between 1980 and 2009 were included in this retrospective study. Treatment modalities were assigned to one of three categories: pelvic exenteration, wide excision, and nonsurgical (primary radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both). Overall survival and progression-free survival were calculated from the date of the surgical diagnosis. The median age was 60.6 years. Eighty-four percent of patients were white. Vaginal bleeding was the most common presenting symptom. Lesions were located in the distal third of the vagina in the majority (65%) of patients. Initial management included a wide local or radical excision (76% of patients); pelvic exenteration (14%); and radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy and chemotherapy (10%). At a median follow-up of 17.4 months, 33 women experienced disease recurrence. Recurrence was local only in seven patients (22%), distant only in 20 (63%), and both in five (15%). The most common sites of distant recurrence were lungs and liver. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months, and median overall survival was 19 months. The 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 9.5% and 20.0%, respectively. Patients treated surgically had significantly longer survival than those treated nonsurgically (P=.01). Radiotherapy after wide excision reduced local recurrence risk and increased survival from 16.1 months to 29.4 months, although the increase was not significant (P=.46).

Recovery issues of fertility-preserving surgery in patients with early-stage cervical cancer and a model for survivorship: the physician checklist.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2011-01-01,"To present a qualitative data analysis of items exploring the treatment, adjustment, and recovery of 33 patients who underwent radical trachelectomy (RT), and to determine the feasibility of using a physician checklist (PCL) as a model for survivorship assessment. This prospective study was approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Institutional Review Board. Participants completed a survey including exploratory items focused on fertility issues and reproductive concerns, treatment, adjustment, and recovery over 2 years. All responses to the exploratory questions were transcribed verbatim; thematic analysis was used to identify, evaluate, and show patterns within the data set; and descriptive statistics were calculated for thematic categories. A limited waiver of authorization was obtained for medical chart review of these patients (who underwent RT) for 2 years before (January 2006 to December 2007) and 2 years after (January 2008 to December 2009) implementation of the checklist to evaluate its feasibility. In response to ""how successful you feel you will be at conceiving in the future?"" on a scale of 0% to 100%, scores ranged from 54% to 60%. Approximately 70% of the patients reported concerns about conceiving; however, these lessened with time-88% at 6 months to 73% at 24 months. Six percent of women were trying to conceive by 12 months; this increased to 21% by 24 months. Five primary themes emerged from the qualitative analysis that were found to be prevalent across all exploratory items inquiring about difficulties or the hardest adjustment to treatment, recovery, and problems associated with RT; these included menstrual/vaginal issues, emotional impact, life interruptions/return to normalcy, general pain, and recovery process. The PCL identified higher rates of neocervical stenosis (58%), encroachment (54%), vaginal scarring (50%), and dyspareunia (33%) than medical charts, and increased documentation of reproductive consults (54%) and assistance (21%). Global themes expressed by our patients are consistent with those of other cancer survivors.

Local control and outcome in children with localized vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma: a report from the Soft Tissue Sarcoma committee of the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-02-04,"The local control approach for girls with non-resected vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) enrolled onto Intergroup RMS Study Group (IRSG)/Children's Oncology Group (COG) studies has differed from that used at other primary sites by delaying or eliminating radiotherapy (RT) based on response achieved with chemotherapy and delayed primary resection. We reviewed locoregional treatment and outcome for patients with localized RMS of the vagina on the two most recent COG low-risk RMS studies. Forty-one patients with localized vaginal RMS were enrolled: 25 onto D9602 and 16 onto Subset 2 of ARST0331. Only four of the 39 with non-resected tumors received RT. The 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 26% on D9602, and the 2-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 43% on ARST0331. Increased local failure rates appeared to correlate with chemotherapy regimens that incorporated lower cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide. Estimated 5-year and 2-year failure free survival rates were 70% (95% CI: 46%, 84%) on D9602 and 42% (95% CI: 11%, 70%) on ARST0331, respectively. To prevent local recurrence, we recommend a local control approach for patients with non-resected RMS of the vagina that is similar to that used for other primary sites and includes RT. We recognize that potential long-term effects of RT are sometimes unacceptable, especially for children less than 24 months of age. However, when making the decision to eliminate RT, the risk of local recurrence must be considered especially when using a chemotherapy regimen with a total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of ≤ 4.8 g/m².",Clinical Trial,3273.0,43.0,local control approach girls non-resected vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma RMS enrolled Intergroup RMS Group IRSG /Children 's Oncology Group COG studies differed primary sites delaying eliminating radiotherapy RT based response achieved chemotherapy delayed primary resection reviewed locoregional treatment outcome patients localized RMS vagina recent COG low-risk RMS studies Forty-one patients localized vaginal RMS enrolled 25 D9602 16 Subset 2 ARST0331 39 non-resected received RT 5-year cumulative incidence local recurrence 26 D9602 2-year cumulative incidence local recurrence 43 ARST0331 Increased local failure rates appeared correlate chemotherapy regimens incorporated lower cumulative doses cyclophosphamide Estimated 5-year 2-year failure free survival rates 70 95 CI 46 84 D9602 42 95 CI 11 70 ARST0331 respectively prevent local recurrence recommend local control approach patients non-resected RMS vagina similar primary sites includes RT recognize potential long-term effects RT unacceptable especially children 24 months age making decision eliminate RT risk local recurrence considered especially chemotherapy regimen total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose ≤ 4.8 g/m²,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 293, 182, 353, 9, 5989, 5, 220, 1133, 3413, 346, 3301, 4839, 3413, 45, 87, 25047, 541, 292, 413, 87, 6377, 94, 71, 2512, 29, 17, 95, 28, 127, 86, 633, 20, 7151, 15, 6923, 310, 240, 90, 23, 51, 513, 5, 56, 2, 1612, 86, 170, 21, 446, 1325, 24, 2, 228, 9, 7, 5, 909, 3413, 1, 3, 7553, 23, 3, 100, 96, 435, 6377, 154, 43, 3413, 94, 1213, 104, 7, 5, 909, 3413, 11, 346, 243, 3301, 18613, 2, 245, 3301, 697, 18, 1, 18023, 158, 294, 1, 3, 587, 5, 220, 1133, 57, 103, 240, 3, 33, 111, 967, 287, 1, 293, 146, 10, 432, 23, 18613, 2, 3, 18, 111, 967, 287, 1, 293, 146, 10, 601, 23, 18023, 101, 293, 496, 151, 2121, 6, 1513, 5, 56, 472, 17, 2449, 280, 967, 415, 1, 1112, 661, 33, 111, 2, 18, 111, 496, 115, 25, 151, 11, 431, 48, 58, 641, 874, 23, 18613, 2, 595, 48, 58, 175, 431, 23, 18023, 106, 6, 1682, 293, 146, 21, 2237, 8, 293, 182, 353, 9, 7, 5, 220, 1133, 3413, 1, 3, 7553, 17, 16, 288, 6, 17, 95, 9, 127, 86, 633, 2, 1920, 240, 21, 4237, 17, 174, 319, 337, 176, 1, 240, 32, 5164, 3215, 1093, 9, 541, 299, 76, 259, 53, 1, 89, 137, 198, 1079, 3, 948, 6, 4964, 240, 3, 43, 1, 293, 146, 1642, 40, 515, 1093, 198, 75, 8, 56, 477, 5, 8, 181, 967, 1112, 61, 1, 1552, 39, 66, 499, 4709]",1538.0,21298768,Local control outcome children localized vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma report Soft Tissue Sarcoma committee Children 's Oncology Group,0,0.0
Disparities in treatment and survival between African American and White women with vaginal cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-04-15,"The study aims to compare the difference in treatment and survival between White (W) and African American (AA) patients with vaginal cancer (VC). Patients with a diagnosis of invasive vaginal cancer were identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 1988 to 2007 and were divided into White (W) and African American (AA) subgroups. Student's t test, Kaplan-Meier survival methods, and Cox regression proportional hazards were performed. A total of 2675 patients met the inclusion criteria, with histologic distribution of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 2190, 82%) and adenocarcinoma (AC; 485, 18%); 2294 (85.8%) were W, and 381 (14.2%) were AA. Median age was 69 for W and 65 for AA (p<0.001). SCC and AC were equally distributed between W and AA. Advanced stage disease (FIGO III and IV) was more prominent in AA compared with W (30.4% vs. 23.1%, p=0.019). Radiation therapy was utilized equally in both racial groups; however, surgical treatment alone or combined with radiation therapy was more frequent in W compared with AA (27.7% vs. 17.5%, p<0.001). The 5-year survival was 45% in W and 38.6% in AA (p=0.008). In multivariate analysis, AA had significantly poorer survival compared with Whites when controlling for age, histology, stage, grade and treatment modality (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p=0.007). African American women with vaginal cancer were more likely to present, at a younger age, advanced stage and less likely to receive surgical treatment.

Defining prognostic variables in recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer: a 15-year single-institution review.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2011-08-01,"This study aimed to examine the pattern of recurrence in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer and to identify clinically important prognostic factors in the recurrent population. With institutional review board approval, a retrospective review identified 1061 patients who underwent primary surgery and treatment of endometrioid endometrial cancer at our institution from 1994 to 2007. Of this cohort, 77 (7.2%) patients developed a recurrence. Clinical factors were recorded, and Spearman correlation coefficients and χ test were used to determine associations between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional-hazards model were used to determine how prognostic variables affected survival after recurrence (RS) and overall survival (OS). Of 77 patients, site of recurrence was not available in 5 patients. The distribution of recurrence in the remaining 72 patients was as follows: isolated vaginal 18% (13/72), nonvaginal pelvic 12% (9/72), distant 31% (22/72), abdominal 24% (17/72), and nodal 15% (11/72). There was an overrepresentation of advanced stage (P < 0.001) and high-grade (P < 0.003) at presentation in the recurrent group. Median OS was 3.4 years and median RS was 1.3 years. Low-grade tumors, early stage, and those with less than 50% myometrial invasion were associated with a significant OS and RS advantage. Age-adjusted isolated vaginal recurrence presented with a 1.2-year RS survival advantage (P < 0.03). An age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio model incorporating significant prognostic variables demonstrated that the only independent variable associated with worse OS and RS was increased histologic grade with a hazard ratio of 2.31 (95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.97) for RS and 2.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-4.62) for OS. Those patients with high-grade histology at the time of initial diagnosis manifest a decreased OS and RS, suggesting that the intrinsic biology of the tumor has the greatest prognostic importance.",Journal Article,3095.0,14.0,aimed examine pattern recurrence patients endometrioid endometrial identify clinically important prognostic factors recurrent population institutional review board approval retrospective review identified 1061 patients underwent primary surgery treatment endometrioid endometrial institution 1994 2007 cohort 77 7.2 patients developed recurrence Clinical factors recorded Spearman correlation coefficients χ test determine associations groups Kaplan-Meier survival estimates Cox proportional-hazards model determine prognostic variables affected survival recurrence RS overall survival OS 77 patients site recurrence available 5 patients distribution recurrence remaining 72 patients follows isolated vaginal 18 13/72 nonvaginal pelvic 12 9/72 distant 31 22/72 abdominal 24 17/72 nodal 15 11/72 overrepresentation advanced stage P 0.001 high-grade P 0.003 presentation recurrent group Median OS 3.4 years median RS 1.3 years Low-grade early stage 50 myometrial invasion associated significant OS RS advantage Age-adjusted isolated vaginal recurrence presented 1.2-year RS survival advantage P 0.03 age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio model incorporating significant prognostic variables demonstrated independent variable associated worse OS RS increased histologic grade hazard ratio 2.31 95 confidence interval 1.25-3.97 RS 2.44 95 confidence interval 1.41-4.62 OS patients high-grade histology time initial diagnosis manifest decreased OS RS suggesting intrinsic greatest prognostic importance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 1295, 6, 1004, 3, 1177, 1, 146, 4, 7, 5, 3151, 12, 2, 6, 255, 505, 305, 177, 130, 4, 3, 387, 266, 5, 1115, 206, 2620, 1814, 8, 459, 206, 108, 22601, 7, 54, 208, 86, 152, 2, 24, 1, 3151, 12, 28, 114, 731, 29, 3023, 6, 1307, 1, 26, 180, 849, 67, 18, 7, 276, 8, 146, 38, 130, 11, 1872, 2, 5061, 816, 5161, 2, 5112, 412, 11, 95, 6, 223, 685, 59, 271, 876, 882, 25, 1423, 2, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 11, 95, 6, 223, 832, 177, 682, 1424, 25, 50, 146, 2250, 2, 63, 25, 118, 1, 849, 7, 606, 1, 146, 10, 44, 390, 4, 33, 7, 3, 1395, 1, 146, 4, 3, 1844, 720, 7, 10, 22, 2962, 1355, 203, 233, 720, 60185, 1110, 133, 83, 720, 626, 456, 350, 720, 1467, 259, 269, 720, 2, 779, 167, 175, 720, 125, 10, 35, 19547, 1, 131, 82, 19, 13, 144, 2, 64, 88, 19, 13, 1421, 28, 1031, 4, 3, 387, 87, 52, 118, 10, 27, 39, 60, 2, 52, 2250, 10, 14, 27, 60, 154, 88, 57, 191, 82, 2, 135, 5, 299, 76, 212, 7327, 578, 11, 41, 5, 8, 93, 118, 2, 2250, 1874, 89, 586, 1355, 146, 917, 5, 8, 14, 18, 111, 2250, 25, 1874, 19, 13, 680, 35, 89, 586, 418, 831, 360, 197, 202, 2570, 93, 177, 682, 264, 17, 3, 158, 306, 1347, 41, 5, 639, 118, 2, 2250, 10, 101, 884, 88, 5, 8, 360, 197, 1, 18, 456, 48, 307, 268, 14, 243, 27, 1015, 9, 2250, 2, 18, 584, 48, 307, 268, 14, 605, 39, 744, 9, 118, 135, 7, 5, 64, 88, 784, 28, 3, 98, 1, 388, 147, 7633, 8, 340, 118, 2, 2250, 802, 17, 3, 2354, 891, 1, 3, 30, 71, 3, 2199, 177, 1187]",1883.0,21633304,Defining prognostic variables recurrent endometrioid endometrial 15-year single-institution review,0,0.0

Urogenital atrophy is frequently undiagnosed and untreated, particularly in breast cancer survivors. Symptoms of urogenital atrophy can usually be relieved with vaginal estrogen preparations, but risk of recurrence and safety is undefined in women with a history of breast cancer. Treatment with nonhormonal modalities including vaginal moisturizers or lubricants and lifestyle modification are the first lines of management. Low-dose vaginal 17 β-estradiol (vaginal estradiol tablets 10 μg or vaginal estradiol ring) can be considered for the treatment of symptomatic urogenital atrophy in women with a history of breast cancer after appropriate disclosure to the patient.

Pagetoid adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix with pagetoid spread into the vagina.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2011-08-01,"Pagetoid spread of adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix into vaginal epithelium is a rare phenomenon, mimicking Paget's disease of the vulva. We report a case of in situ squamous cell and in situ adenocarcinoma of the cervix in a 44-year-old woman who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and upper vaginectomy. Pathologic evaluation showed pagetoid endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ spreading into the vagina with positive margins.

Recurrence patterns and surveillance for patients with early stage endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol.

Patients undergoing primary surgery with final pathology consistent with a grade 1 endometrial cancer confined to the endometrium (FIGO 1988 stage IA) between 9/1997-12/2007 were retrospectively identified. Follow-up data for at least 2 years was also collected, including diagnosis of a recurrence, symptomatology at that time, and method of detection. Costs for vaginal cytology were estimated using Medicare charge-to-cost ratios adjusted to 2010 costs. One hundred fifty-four patients met study inclusion criteria. The mean age was 54.4 years and the mean follow-up was 46.9 months. Four recurrences were detected, occurring 16-73 months after the initial diagnosis. During a scheduled visit, one patient was found to have an asymptomatic vaginal cuff recurrence, detected on physical examination. The remaining three cases were diagnosed at an unscheduled visit after the presence of symptoms (vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, shortness of breath) prompted further evaluation. In all, cytology detected no cases of recurrence and the estimated cost associated with cytology alone for all patients over the study time frame was approximately $7,760 per year. Patients with grade 1 endometrial cancer confined to the endometrium have a low risk of recurrence (2.6%) and were detected on clinical findings alone.

Patients with low-risk RMS were nonrandomly assigned to receive radiotherapy doses dependent on the completeness of surgical resection of the primary tumor (clinical group) and the presence of involved regional lymph nodes. After resection, most patients with microscopic residual and uninvolved nodes received 36 Gy, those with involved nodes received 41.4 to 50.4 Gy, and those with orbital primary tumors received 45 Gy. All patients received vincristine and dactinomycin, with cyclophosphamide added for patient subsets with a higher risk of relapse in Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group III and IV studies. Three hundred forty-two patients were eligible for analysis; 172 received radiotherapy as part of their treatment. The cumulative incidence of local/regional failure was 15% in patients with microscopic involved margins when cyclophosphamide was not part of the treatment regimen and 0% when cyclophosphamide was included. The cumulative incidence of local/regional failure was 14% in patients with orbital tumors. Protocol-specified omission of radiotherapy in girls with Group IIA vaginal tumors (n = 5) resulted in three failures for this group.

Modified vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap vaginal reconstruction: an analysis of surgical outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-12-11,"To examine the early and late flap related morbidity and associated risk factors in patients with modified vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) flap neovaginal reconstruction at the time of pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancy. From January 1993 to January 2011, all patients were identified who underwent anterior, posterior, or total pelvic exenteration with VRAM flap neovaginal reconstruction. Patient records were systematically reviewed and demographic, clinicopathologic, operative details, flap related complications, and risk factors for wound healing were recorded and statistical analysis performed. 46 patients were identified who underwent exenteration with VRAM flap vaginal reconstruction. A risk factor for poor healing including obesity, diabetes, smoking, prior radiation, previous abdominal surgery, or poor nutritional status was present in 38 (82.6%) patients, and 24 (52.2%) had two or more risk factors. Flap complications occurred in 9 (19.6%) patients, one with complete flap necrosis that required re-operation, two with superficial flap necrosis, and three with superficial flap separation. Three patients (6.5%) suffered from vaginal stenosis, one of which was complete. Anterior abdominal wound separation occurred in 22 (47.8%) patients and pelvic abscess occurred in 14 (30.4%) patients. No individual risk factor was significantly associated with VRAM flap related morbidity; however obesity, prior radiation, and prior abdominal incision were present in nearly all the patients with flap complications.

The effect of body mass index on surgical outcomes and survival following pelvic exenteration.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-01-16,"We sought to evaluate whether preoperative body mass index (BMI) impacts surgical outcomes, complication rates, and/or recurrence rates in women undergoing pelvic exenteration. All women who underwent pelvic exenteration for gynecologic indications at our institution from 1993 through 2010 were included. Women were stratified into 3 groups based on BMI. Baseline characteristics, surgical outcomes, early (<60 days) and late (≥ 60 days) postoperative complications, and recurrence/survival outcomes were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using log-rank test. 161 patients were included (59 normal weight, 44 overweight, 58 obese). Median follow-up times were 22, 29, and 25 months. Most patients underwent total pelvic exenteration (68%); 64.6% had a vaginal reconstruction. On multivariate analysis, both overweight and obese patients had a higher risk of early superficial wound separation compared to normal weight patients - OR 10.74 (3.33-34.62, p<0.001) and OR 4.35 (1.40-13.52, p=0.011), respectively. Length of surgery was significantly longer for overweight (9.6h, OR 1.26, 1.02-1.55, p=0.032) and obese (10.1h, OR 1.24, 1.04-1.47, p=0.014) patients than for normal weight patients (8.7h). Late postoperative complications for patients in the normal weight, overweight, and obese groups were 47.5%, 45.5%, and 43.1% (p=0.144). There were no differences in time to recurrence (p=0.752) or overall survival (p=0.103) between groups. Although operative times were longer and risk for superficial wound separation was significantly higher, pelvic exenteration appears to be feasible and safe in overweight and obese women with overall complication rates and survival outcomes comparable to normal weight women.",Journal Article,2927.0,11.0,sought evaluate preoperative body mass index BMI impacts surgical outcomes complication rates and/or recurrence rates women undergoing pelvic exenteration women underwent pelvic exenteration gynecologic indications institution 1993 2010 included Women stratified 3 groups based BMI Baseline characteristics surgical outcomes early 60 days late ≥ 60 days postoperative complications recurrence/survival outcomes collected Multivariate logistic regression performed Kaplan-Meier survival curves compared log-rank test 161 patients included 59 normal weight 44 overweight 58 obese Median follow-up times 22 29 25 months patients underwent total pelvic exenteration 68 64.6 vaginal reconstruction multivariate overweight obese patients higher risk early superficial wound separation compared normal weight patients 10.74 3.33-34.62 p 0.001 4.35 1.40-13.52 p=0.011 respectively Length surgery significantly longer overweight 9.6h 1.26 1.02-1.55 p=0.032 obese 10.1h 1.24 1.04-1.47 p=0.014 patients normal weight patients 8.7h Late postoperative complications patients normal weight overweight obese groups 47.5 45.5 43.1 p=0.144 differences time recurrence p=0.752 overall survival p=0.103 groups operative times longer risk superficial wound separation significantly higher pelvic exenteration appears feasible safe overweight obese women overall complication rates survival outcomes comparable normal weight women,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 990, 6, 376, 317, 498, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 4719, 221, 123, 1447, 151, 2, 15, 146, 151, 4, 117, 479, 1110, 5668, 62, 117, 54, 208, 1110, 5668, 9, 1512, 2406, 28, 114, 731, 29, 3343, 298, 1120, 11, 159, 117, 11, 1173, 237, 27, 271, 90, 23, 1140, 330, 374, 221, 123, 191, 335, 162, 2, 807, 749, 335, 162, 573, 521, 2, 146, 25, 123, 11, 786, 331, 812, 320, 318, 11, 173, 876, 882, 25, 2400, 11, 72, 75, 1066, 1026, 412, 5377, 7, 11, 159, 728, 295, 924, 584, 3566, 717, 2209, 52, 166, 126, 1072, 11, 350, 462, 2, 243, 53, 96, 7, 208, 181, 1110, 5668, 806, 660, 49, 42, 8, 1470, 23, 331, 65, 110, 3566, 2, 2209, 7, 42, 8, 142, 43, 1, 191, 3562, 2689, 5422, 72, 6, 295, 924, 7, 15, 79, 794, 27, 466, 562, 744, 19, 13, 144, 2, 15, 39, 465, 14, 327, 233, 653, 19, 13, 3651, 106, 1318, 1, 152, 10, 97, 589, 9, 3566, 83, 31910, 15, 14, 432, 14, 588, 14, 614, 19, 13, 4708, 2, 2209, 79, 10147, 15, 14, 259, 14, 755, 14, 662, 19, 13, 3618, 7, 76, 9, 295, 924, 7, 66, 61018, 807, 573, 521, 9, 7, 4, 3, 295, 924, 3566, 2, 2209, 271, 11, 662, 33, 512, 33, 2, 601, 14, 19, 13, 4415, 125, 11, 77, 362, 4, 98, 6, 146, 19, 13, 11611, 15, 63, 25, 19, 13, 3283, 59, 271, 242, 1208, 1072, 11, 589, 2, 43, 9, 3562, 2689, 5422, 10, 97, 142, 1110, 5668, 1233, 6, 40, 1313, 2, 1165, 4, 3566, 2, 2209, 117, 5, 63, 1447, 151, 2, 25, 123, 1279, 6, 295, 924, 117]",1714.0,22261299,effect body mass index surgical outcomes survival following pelvic exenteration,0,0.0
A phase II study of bevacizumab in combination with definitive radiotherapy and cisplatin chemotherapy in untreated patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma: preliminary results of RTOG 0417.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-02-16,"Concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. RTOG 0417 was a Phase II study exploring the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to standard CRT. Eligible patients with bulky tumors (Stage IB-IIIB) were treated with once-weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) chemotherapy and standard pelvic radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for three cycles. Treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) and other adverse event (AE) rates within the first 90 days from treatment start were determined. Treatment-related SAEs were defined as any Grade ≥ 4 vaginal bleeding or thrombotic event or Grade ≥ 3 arterial event, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or bowel/bladder perforation, or any Grade 5 treatment-related death. Treatment-related AEs included all SAEs and Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity persisting for >2 weeks despite medical intervention, Grade 4 neutropenia or leukopenia persisting for >7 days, febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 or 4 other hematologic toxicity, and Grade 3 or 4 GI, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or neurologic AEs. All AEs were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v 3.0 (MedDRA version 6.0). A total of 60 patients from 28 institutions were enrolled between 2006 and 2009, and of these, 49 patients were evaluable. The median follow-up was 12.4 months (range, 4.6-31.4 months).The median age was 45 years (range, 22-80 years). Most patients had FIGO Stage IIB (63%) and were of Zubrod performance status of 0 (67%). 80% of cases were squamous. There were no treatment-related SAEs. There were 15 (31%) protocol-specified treatment-related AEs within 90 days of treatment start; the most common were hematologic (12/15; 80%). 18 (37%) occurred during treatment or follow-up at any time. 37 of the 49 patients (76%) had cisplatin and bevacizumab administered per protocol, and 46 of the 49 (94%) had both external beam and brachytherapy administered per protocol or with acceptable variation. Bevacizumab in addition to standard pelvic chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer is feasible and safe with respect to the protocol-specified treatment-related SAEs and AEs.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2896.0,57.0,Concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy CRT standard treatment locally advanced cervical RTOG 0417 Phase II exploring safety efficacy addition bevacizumab standard CRT Eligible patients bulky Stage IB-IIIB treated once-weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 chemotherapy standard pelvic radiotherapy brachytherapy Bevacizumab administered 10 mg/kg intravenously 2 weeks cycles Treatment-related adverse event SAE adverse event AE rates 90 days treatment start determined Treatment-related SAEs defined Grade ≥ 4 vaginal bleeding thrombotic event Grade ≥ 3 arterial event gastrointestinal GI bleeding bowel/bladder perforation Grade 5 treatment-related death Treatment-related AEs included SAEs Grade 3 4 GI toxicity persisting 2 weeks despite medical intervention Grade 4 neutropenia leukopenia persisting 7 days febrile neutropenia Grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity Grade 3 4 GI renal cardiac pulmonary hepatic neurologic AEs AEs scored National Institute Common Terminology Criteria CTCAE v 3.0 MedDRA version 6.0 total 60 patients 28 institutions enrolled 2006 2009 49 patients evaluable median follow-up 12.4 months range 4.6-31.4 months .The median age 45 years range 22-80 years patients FIGO Stage IIB 63 Zubrod performance status 0 67 80 cases squamous treatment-related SAEs 15 31 protocol-specified treatment-related AEs 90 days treatment start common hematologic 12/15 80 18 37 occurred treatment follow-up time 37 49 patients 76 cisplatin bevacizumab administered protocol 46 49 94 external beam brachytherapy administered protocol acceptable variation Bevacizumab addition standard pelvic chemoradiotherapy locally advanced cervical feasible safe respect protocol-specified treatment-related SAEs AEs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"[750, 540, 90, 1464, 1089, 16, 3, 260, 24, 9, 795, 131, 12, 3931, 31404, 10, 8, 124, 215, 45, 4378, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 3, 352, 1, 599, 6, 260, 1089, 625, 7, 5, 4112, 57, 82, 3180, 3036, 11, 73, 5, 1059, 709, 540, 327, 81, 188, 18, 56, 2, 260, 1110, 310, 2, 1536, 599, 10, 468, 28, 79, 81, 503, 1672, 454, 18, 244, 9, 169, 410, 24, 139, 1762, 290, 774, 29193, 2, 127, 290, 774, 3633, 151, 262, 3, 157, 424, 162, 29, 24, 2435, 11, 509, 24, 139, 11499, 11, 395, 22, 500, 88, 749, 39, 2294, 15, 6108, 774, 15, 88, 749, 27, 3127, 774, 2104, 2294, 15, 1659, 9685, 4854, 15, 500, 88, 33, 24, 139, 273, 24, 139, 1477, 159, 62, 11499, 2, 88, 27, 15, 39, 2104, 155, 12099, 9, 18, 244, 550, 484, 788, 88, 39, 778, 15, 3904, 12099, 9, 67, 162, 2498, 778, 88, 27, 15, 39, 127, 813, 155, 2, 88, 27, 15, 39, 2104, 1087, 939, 15, 2543, 1477, 62, 1477, 11, 3179, 75, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 3462, 371, 3898, 603, 27, 13, 35303, 2256, 49, 13, 8, 181, 1, 335, 7, 29, 339, 1764, 11, 346, 59, 1324, 2, 1238, 2, 1, 46, 739, 7, 11, 859, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 133, 39, 53, 184, 39, 49, 456, 39, 53, 3, 52, 89, 10, 512, 60, 184, 350, 493, 60, 96, 7, 42, 3837, 82, 3884, 676, 2, 11, 1, 10672, 528, 156, 1, 13, 598, 493, 1, 140, 11, 691, 125, 11, 77, 24, 139, 11499, 125, 11, 167, 456, 1182, 3575, 24, 139, 1477, 262, 424, 162, 1, 24, 2435, 3, 96, 186, 11, 813, 133, 167, 493, 203, 567, 489, 190, 24, 15, 166, 126, 28, 500, 98, 567, 1, 3, 739, 7, 846, 42, 540, 2, 599, 468, 379, 1182, 2, 641, 1, 3, 739, 960, 42, 110, 1455, 1345, 2, 1536, 468, 379, 1182, 15, 5, 1595, 1380, 599, 4, 352, 6, 260, 1110, 1464, 9, 795, 131, 12, 16, 1313, 2, 1165, 5, 2184, 6, 3, 1182, 3575, 24, 139, 11499, 2, 1477]",2140.0,22342094,phase II bevacizumab combination definitive radiotherapy cisplatin chemotherapy untreated patients locally advanced cervical carcinoma preliminary RTOG 0417,0,0.0
Sexual function after intracavitary vaginal brachytherapy for early-stage endometrial carcinoma.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-05-01,"To describe the effects of intracavitary brachytherapy (IVB) on sexual function and quality of life of women with early-stage endometrial cancer. Women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I to stage II endometrial cancer treated surgically with or without IVB were identified and mailed questionnaires. Quality of life and sexual function were measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and the cervical cancer disease-specific module. Pertinent data from prior surgery and radiation treatments were abstracted retrospectively. Linear transformation of the survey subscale scores was conducted per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines. Sixteen women in the IVB arm and 53 in the surgery-alone group completed the survey. Of the sexually active patients, 33% of the IVB patients and 42% of the surgery-alone patients felt their vagina was dry during sexual activity (P = 0.804) and 17% versus 20% felt their vagina was short (P = 0.884).

"Minireview: human ovarian cancer: biology, current management, and paths to personalizing therapy.",Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2012-03-13,"More than 90% of ovarian cancers have been thought to arise from epithelial cells that cover the ovarian surface or, more frequently, line subserosal cysts. Recent studies suggest that histologically similar cancers can arise from the fimbriae of Fallopian tubes and from deposits of endometriosis. Different histotypes are observed that resemble epithelial cells from the normal Fallopian tube (serous), endometrium (endometrioid), cervical glands (mucinous), and vaginal rests (clear cell) and that share expression of relevant HOX genes which drive normal gynecological differentiation. Two groups of epithelial ovarian cancers have been distinguished: type I low-grade cancers that present in early stage, grow slowly, and resist conventional chemotherapy but may respond to hormonal manipulation; and type II high-grade cancers that are generally diagnosed in advanced stage and grow aggressively but respond to chemotherapy. Type I cancers have wild-type p53 and BRCA1/2, but have frequent mutations of Ras and Raf as well as expression of IGFR and activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Virtually all type II cancers have mutations of p53, and almost half have mutation or dysfunction of BRCA1/2, but other mutations are rare, and oncogenesis appears to be driven by amplification of several growth-regulatory genes that activate the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy with platinum compounds and taxanes have improved 5-yr survival, but less than 40% of all stages can be cured. Novel therapies are being developed that target high-grade serous cancer cells with PI3Kness or BRCAness as well as the tumor vasculature. Both in silico and animal models are needed that more closely resemble type I and type II cancers to facilitate the identification of novel targets and to predict response to combinations of new agents.",Journal Article,2870.0,177.0,90 ovarian thought arise epithelial cover ovarian surface frequently line subserosal cysts Recent studies suggest histologically similar arise fimbriae Fallopian tubes deposits endometriosis Different histotypes observed resemble epithelial normal Fallopian tube serous endometrium endometrioid cervical glands mucinous vaginal rests clear share expression relevant HOX drive normal gynecological differentiation groups epithelial ovarian distinguished type low-grade present early stage grow slowly resist conventional chemotherapy respond hormonal manipulation type II high-grade generally diagnosed advanced stage grow aggressively respond chemotherapy Type wild-type p53 BRCA1/2 frequent Ras Raf expression IGFR activation phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase PI3K pathway Virtually type II p53 half dysfunction BRCA1/2 rare oncogenesis appears driven amplification growth-regulatory activate Ras/MAPK PI3K pathways Cytoreductive surgery combination chemotherapy platinum compounds taxanes improved 5-yr survival 40 stages cured Novel therapies developed target high-grade serous PI3Kness BRCAness vasculature silico animal models needed closely resemble type type II facilitate identification novel targets predict response combinations new agents,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[80, 76, 424, 1, 163, 47, 85, 2739, 6, 3043, 29, 701, 37, 17, 8308, 3, 1255, 15, 80, 746, 328, 23477, 4395, 435, 94, 309, 17, 2161, 288, 163, 122, 3043, 29, 3, 61226, 1, 6193, 2, 29, 7626, 1, 7915, 338, 13101, 32, 164, 17, 8247, 701, 37, 29, 3, 295, 2330, 1744, 3151, 3966, 2391, 2, 14405, 885, 31, 2, 17, 4349, 55, 1, 867, 14722, 214, 92, 3279, 295, 6324, 910, 100, 271, 1, 701, 163, 47, 85, 4735, 267, 70, 154, 88, 163, 17, 364, 4, 191, 82, 6265, 7681, 2, 13010, 809, 56, 84, 68, 1892, 6, 1761, 6239, 2, 267, 215, 64, 88, 163, 17, 32, 1228, 265, 4, 131, 82, 2, 6265, 8503, 84, 1892, 6, 56, 267, 70, 163, 47, 955, 267, 624, 2, 766, 18, 84, 47, 908, 138, 1, 1102, 2, 2212, 22, 149, 22, 55, 1, 35049, 2, 363, 1, 3, 3415, 27, 216, 974, 308, 5860, 62, 267, 215, 163, 47, 138, 1, 624, 2, 2214, 1303, 47, 258, 15, 1527, 1, 766, 18, 84, 127, 138, 32, 622, 2, 4503, 1233, 6, 40, 1621, 20, 1073, 1, 392, 129, 1253, 214, 17, 2977, 3, 1102, 1748, 2, 974, 460, 2604, 152, 2, 150, 56, 5, 828, 2411, 2, 2961, 47, 231, 33, 2830, 25, 84, 299, 76, 327, 1, 62, 1153, 122, 40, 3733, 229, 235, 32, 486, 276, 17, 283, 64, 88, 1744, 12, 37, 5, 47123, 15, 16971, 22, 149, 22, 3, 30, 3805, 110, 4, 6648, 2, 2026, 274, 32, 575, 17, 80, 3210, 8247, 267, 70, 2, 267, 215, 163, 6, 1876, 3, 911, 1, 229, 637, 2, 6, 678, 51, 6, 1247, 1, 217, 183]",1789.0,22416079,Minireview human ovarian current management paths personalizing therapy,157,0.7889447236180904

Phys.,2012-04-28,"The optimal adjuvant therapy for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I papillary serous (UPSC) or clear cell (CC) endometrial cancer is unknown. We report on the largest single-institution experience using adjuvant high-dose-rate vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) for surgically staged women with FIGO stage I UPSC or CC endometrial cancer. From 1998-2011, 103 women with FIGO 2009 stage I UPSC (n=74), CC (n=21), or mixed UPSC/CC (n=8) endometrial cancer underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by adjuvant high-dose-rate VBT. Nearly all patients (n=98, 95%) also underwent extended lymph node dissection of pelvic and paraortic lymph nodes. All VBT was performed with a vaginal cylinder, treating to a dose of 2100 cGy in 3 fractions. Thirty-five patients (34%) also received adjuvant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up time of 36 months (range, 1-146 months), 2 patients had experienced vaginal recurrence, and the 5-year Kaplan Meier estimate of vaginal recurrence was 3%. The rates of isolated pelvic recurrence, locoregional recurrence (vaginal+pelvic), and extrapelvic recurrence (including intraabdominal) were similarly low, with 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of 4%, 7%, and 10%, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival was 84%. On univariate analysis, delivery of chemotherapy did not affect recurrence or survival. VBT is effective at preventing vaginal relapse in women with surgical stage I UPSC or CC endometrial cancer.

Orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2012-06-01,"Locally advanced and recurrent colorectal cancers pose a significant therapeutic challenge. Orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy provides one potential means of improving disease control at the time of surgery. This study sought to analyze outcomes and identify prognostic factors of patients treated with orthovoltage intraoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. This study is a retrospective chart review conducted at a tertiary medical center. Between January 1990 and July 2009, 55 patients underwent intraoperative radiotherapy to a total of 61 sites for locally advanced (n = 14) or recurrent (n = 41) cancers of colon (n = 18) or rectum/rectosigmoid junction (n = 37). Median dose was 12 Gy (range, 7.5-20 Gy). Among locally advanced rectal/rectosigmoid cases, surgery included abdominoperineal resection (n = 3) or low anterior resection (n = 9). Seven treated sites had gross residual (R2) disease, 28 had pathologic or clinical microscopic residual disease (R1), and 15 were complete resections (R0). Treated sites included sacrum (n = 22), anterior pelvis/pelvic sidewall (19), sacrum and sidewall (n = 1), aortic bifurcation (n = 2), vaginal cuff (n = 2), psoas (n = 3), perivesicular region (n = 2), and other (n = 10). Outcomes measures included in-field local control, locoregional control, overall survival, and grade ≥3 toxicity. At a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 4-237) among living patients, 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of in-field local control, locoregional control, and overall survival were 69%, 51%, and 59%. Margin status predicted for improved locoregional control (p = 0.01) and overall survival (p = 0.01).

Rhabdomyosarcoma of the cervix in adult women and younger patients.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-05-15,"Cervical rhabdomyosarcoma is extremely rare, and there is a paucity of literature on the subject. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma who presented to our institution from 1980 to 2010. We reviewed pathologic, demographic, and clinical information. During the study period, 11 females presented with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma. The median age at presentation was 18.4 years, and 6 patients were <19 years old at diagnosis. Vaginal bleeding was the most common presenting symptom, and a vaginal mass was often a co-presenting symptom. Eight patients (73%) presented with stage IB disease, and 8 (73%) presented with the embryonal (botryoid) histologic subtype. Nine patients (82%) received multimodal therapy consisting of surgery with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. All patients were without evidence of disease after completion of primary therapy, but 3 patients experienced local recurrence. At a median follow-up of 23 months, 6 patients (55%) were without evidence of disease, 1 (9%) was alive with disease, 1 (9%) had died of disease, and 3 (27%) had died of other causes. Three patients (27%) had other primary malignancies in addition to rhabdomyosarcoma-1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, 1 had a Sertoli-Leydig tumor and a pinealoblastoma, and 1 had thyroid cancer and a parotid adenocarcinoma. With multimodal therapy, cervical rhabdomyosarcoma appears to be associated with a good prognosis.

Reproducibility and genital sparing with a vaginal dilator used for female anal cancer patients.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2012-07-26,"Acute vulvitis, acute urethritis, and permanent sexual dysfunction are common among patients treated with chemoradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Avoidance of the genitalia may reduce sexual dysfunction. A vaginal dilator may help delineate and displace the vulva and lower vagina away from the primary tumor. The goal of this study was to evaluate the positional reproducibility and vaginal sparing with the use of a vaginal dilator. Ten female patients treated with IMRT for anal cancer were included in this study. A silicone vaginal dilator measuring 29 mm in diameter and 114 mm in length was inserted into the vagina before simulation and each treatment. The reproducibility of dilator placement was investigated with antero-posterior and lateral images acquired daily. Weekly cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging was used to confirm coverage of the GTV, which was typically posterior and inferior to the dilator apex. Finally, a planning study was performed to compare the vaginal doses for these 10 patients to a comparable group of 10 female patients who were treated for anal cancer with IMRT without vaginal dilators. The absolute values of the location of the dilator apex were 7.0 ± 7.8mm in the supero-inferior direction, 7.5 ± 5.5 mm in the antero-posterior, and 3.8 ± 3.1mm in the lateral direction. Coverage of the GTV and CTV was confirmed from CBCT images. The mean dose to the vagina was lower by 5.5 Gy, on average, for the vaginal dilator patients, compared to patients treated without vaginal dilators. The vaginal dilator tended to be inserted more inferiorly during treatment than during simulation. For these ten patients, this did not compromise tumor coverage. Combined with IMRT treatment planning, use of a vaginal dilator could allow for maximum sparing of female genitalia for patients undergoing radiation therapy for anal cancer.",Journal Article,2735.0,10.0,Acute vulvitis acute urethritis permanent sexual dysfunction common patients treated chemoradiation squamous carcinoma anal canal Avoidance genitalia reduce sexual dysfunction vaginal dilator help delineate displace vulva lower vagina away primary goal evaluate positional reproducibility vaginal sparing use vaginal dilator female patients treated IMRT anal included silicone vaginal dilator measuring 29 mm diameter 114 mm length inserted vagina simulation treatment reproducibility dilator placement investigated antero-posterior lateral images acquired daily Weekly cone beam CT CBCT imaging confirm coverage GTV typically posterior inferior dilator apex Finally planning performed compare vaginal doses 10 patients comparable group 10 female patients treated anal IMRT vaginal dilators absolute values location dilator apex 7.0 ± 7.8mm supero-inferior direction 7.5 ± 5.5 mm antero-posterior 3.8 ± 3.1mm lateral direction Coverage GTV CTV confirmed CBCT images mean dose vagina lower 5.5 Gy average vaginal dilator patients compared patients treated vaginal dilators vaginal dilator tended inserted inferiorly treatment simulation patients compromise coverage Combined IMRT treatment planning use vaginal dilator allow maximum sparing female genitalia patients undergoing radiation therapy anal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 61711, 286, 47311, 2, 4377, 2232, 1527, 32, 186, 107, 7, 73, 5, 975, 9, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 5614, 5863, 1, 3, 33952, 68, 969, 2232, 1527, 8, 17967, 68, 987, 5092, 2, 17651, 3, 9263, 2, 280, 7553, 6565, 29, 3, 86, 30, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 16788, 4688, 2, 1851, 5, 3, 119, 1, 8, 17967, 1618, 1061, 7, 73, 5, 964, 9, 12, 11, 159, 4, 26, 45, 8, 18762, 17967, 2978, 462, 321, 4, 2549, 2, 3803, 321, 4, 1318, 10, 9882, 237, 3, 7553, 348, 4026, 2, 296, 24, 3, 4688, 1, 17967, 2613, 10, 565, 5, 35407, 3028, 2, 3855, 1572, 1294, 391, 709, 6939, 1345, 425, 5187, 270, 10, 95, 6, 1843, 2139, 1, 3, 4046, 92, 10, 1969, 3028, 2, 1663, 6, 3, 17967, 8670, 1368, 8, 1349, 45, 10, 173, 6, 932, 3, 415, 9, 46, 79, 7, 6, 8, 1279, 87, 1, 79, 1061, 7, 54, 11, 73, 9, 12, 5, 964, 187, 47312, 3, 1766, 1030, 1, 3, 1147, 1, 3, 17967, 8670, 11, 67, 13, 810, 67, 39737, 4, 3, 38987, 1663, 4651, 67, 33, 810, 33, 33, 321, 4, 3, 35407, 3028, 2, 27, 66, 810, 27, 22731, 4, 3, 3855, 4651, 2139, 1, 3, 4046, 2, 3402, 10, 557, 29, 5187, 1572, 3, 313, 61, 6, 3, 7553, 10, 280, 20, 33, 33, 381, 23, 1011, 9, 3, 17967, 7, 72, 6, 7, 73, 187, 47312, 3, 17967, 3886, 6, 40, 9882, 80, 25313, 190, 24, 76, 190, 4026, 9, 46, 1618, 7, 26, 205, 44, 4665, 30, 2139, 397, 5, 964, 24, 1349, 119, 1, 8, 17967, 359, 1700, 9, 689, 1851, 1, 1061, 33952, 9, 7, 479, 121, 36, 9, 12]",1748.0,22841019,Reproducibility genital sparing vaginal dilator female anal patients,0,0.0
Five-year outcomes of adjuvant carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy and intravaginal radiation for stage I-II papillary serous endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-07-28,"The purpose of this study is to report our single-institution experience with concurrent adjuvant intravaginal radiation (IVRT) and carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy for early stage uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). From 10/2000 to 12/2009, 41 women with stage I-II UPSC underwent surgery followed by IVRT (median dose of 21 Gy in 3 fractions) and concurrent carboplatin (AUC=5-6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) for six planned cycles. IVRT was administered on non-chemotherapy weeks. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and the log-rank test was used for comparisons. Median patient age was 67 years (51-80 years). Surgery included hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal washings, omental biopsy, and pelvic and paraaortic lymph node sampling. FIGO 2009 stage was IA in 73%, IB in 10%, and II in 17%. Histology was pure serous in 71% of cases. Thirty-five patients (85%) completed all planned treatment. With a median follow-up time of 58 months, the 5-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 85% (95%CI, 73-96%) and 90% (95%CI, 80-100%). The 5-year pelvic, para-aortic, and distant recurrence rates were 9%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. There were no vaginal recurrences. Of the 4 pelvic recurrences, 2 were isolated and were successfully salvaged.

Severe late toxicities following concomitant chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone in cervical cancer: an inter-era analysis.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-08-14,"To compare rates of severe late toxicities following concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone for cervical cancer. Patients with cervical cancer were treated at a single institution with radiotherapy alone or concomitant chemoradiotherapy for curative intent. Severe late toxicity was defined as grade≥3 vaginal, urologic, or gastrointestinal toxicity or any pelvic fracture, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE), occurring ≥6 months from treatment completion and predating any salvage therapy. Severe late toxicity rates were compared after adjusting for pertinent covariates. At 3 years, probability of vaginal severe late toxicity was 20.2% for radiotherapy alone and 35.1% for concomitant chemoradiotherapy (P=.026). At 3 years, probability of skeletal severe late toxicity was 1.6% for radiotherapy alone and 7.5% for concomitant chemoradiotherapy (P=.010). After adjustment for case mix, concomitant chemoradiotherapy was associated with higher vaginal (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-5.2, P<.001), and skeletal (HR 7.0, 95% CI 1.4-34.1, P=.016) severe late toxicity. Compared to high dilator compliance, moderate (HR 3.6, 95% CI 2.0-6.5, P<.001) and poor (HR 8.5, 95% CI 4.3-16.9, P<.001) dilator compliance was associated with higher vaginal severe late toxicity. Age>50 was associated with higher vaginal (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, P=.013) and skeletal (HR 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-27.0, P=.028) severe late toxicity. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy was not associated with higher gastrointestinal (P=.886) or urologic (unadjusted, P=.053; adjusted, P=.063) severe late toxicity. Compared to radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy is associated with higher rates of severe vaginal and skeletal late toxicities.

An international series on abdominal radical trachelectomy: 101 patients and 28 pregnancies.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-09-01,"Abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) is a type C resection (uterine vessels ligated at origin from the hypogastric vessels). Questions arise as to whether fertility is maintained after ART, particularly when uterine vessels are sacrificed. We report an international series on ART to describe fertility and oncologic outcomes. Databases at 3 institutions were queried to identify patients planned for ART from 1999 to 2011. Clinical and demographic data were gathered. One hundred one patients underwent ART. Mean age was 31 years (range, 19-43 years). Histologic classifications were adenocarcinoma (n = 54), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 40), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 6), and clear cell carcinoma (n = 1). Twenty patients (20%) required conversion to hysterectomy (10 margins and 10 nodes). Eight patients underwent completion hysterectomy owing to the following: positive margins on final pathology (n = 3), patient's choice (n = 4), or recurrence (n = 1). Postoperatively, 20 patients (20%) received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation (4 final pathology margins and 16 nodes). Four patients (4%) had recurrence and lived 22 to 35 months after diagnosis. Of the 70 women who had neither hysterectomy nor adjuvant therapy, 38 (54%) attempted pregnancy and 28 (74%) achieved pregnancy. Thirty-one pregnancies resulted in 16 (52%) third trimester deliveries. Six patients are currently pregnant with outcomes pending. These data demonstrate that ART preserves fertility and maintains excellent oncologic outcomes. Most women (74%) attempting pregnancy after ART are able to achieve pregnancy and deliver in the third trimester (52%). Preservation of the uterine vasculature is not necessary for fertility; obstetrical outcomes are similar to those of the historical vaginal radical trachelectomy cohorts.",Journal Article,2698.0,61.0,Abdominal radical trachelectomy ART type C resection uterine vessels ligated origin hypogastric vessels Questions arise fertility maintained ART particularly uterine vessels sacrificed report international series ART fertility oncologic outcomes Databases 3 institutions queried identify patients planned ART 1999 2011 Clinical demographic gathered patients underwent ART Mean age 31 years range 19-43 years Histologic classifications adenocarcinoma n 54 squamous carcinoma n 40 adenosquamous carcinoma n 6 clear carcinoma n 1 patients 20 required conversion hysterectomy 10 margins 10 nodes patients underwent completion hysterectomy owing following positive margins final pathology n 3 patient 's choice n 4 recurrence n 1 Postoperatively 20 patients 20 received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation 4 final pathology margins 16 nodes patients 4 recurrence lived 22 35 months diagnosis 70 women hysterectomy adjuvant therapy 38 54 attempted pregnancy 28 74 achieved pregnancy Thirty-one pregnancies resulted 16 52 trimester deliveries patients currently pregnant outcomes pending demonstrate ART preserves fertility maintains excellent oncologic outcomes women 74 attempting pregnancy ART able achieve pregnancy deliver trimester 52 Preservation uterine vasculature necessary fertility obstetrical outcomes similar historical vaginal radical trachelectomy cohorts,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1467, 711, 5760, 4363, 16, 8, 267, 256, 170, 3102, 18971, 28, 1938, 29, 3, 21449, 3102, 1937, 3043, 22, 6, 317, 2954, 16, 1955, 50, 4363, 823, 198, 3102, 32, 15470, 21, 414, 35, 944, 988, 23, 4363, 6, 897, 2954, 2, 1998, 123, 2348, 28, 27, 1764, 11, 3547, 6, 255, 7, 1465, 9, 4363, 29, 2043, 6, 1132, 38, 2, 1540, 74, 11, 7546, 104, 1128, 104, 7, 208, 4363, 313, 89, 10, 456, 60, 184, 326, 601, 60, 884, 5787, 11, 449, 78, 667, 691, 31, 134, 78, 327, 8067, 134, 78, 49, 2, 885, 31, 134, 78, 14, 737, 7, 179, 616, 3111, 6, 2622, 79, 1012, 2, 79, 502, 659, 7, 208, 1438, 2622, 3421, 6, 3, 366, 109, 1012, 23, 1457, 1117, 78, 27, 69, 292, 1866, 78, 39, 15, 146, 78, 14, 3541, 179, 7, 179, 103, 249, 56, 2, 15, 121, 39, 1457, 1117, 1012, 2, 245, 502, 294, 7, 39, 42, 146, 2, 4813, 350, 6, 465, 53, 50, 147, 1, 3, 431, 117, 54, 42, 2174, 2622, 2110, 249, 36, 519, 667, 4098, 2290, 2, 339, 794, 513, 2290, 977, 104, 8746, 627, 4, 245, 653, 1282, 12693, 26092, 437, 7, 32, 694, 6086, 5, 123, 9453, 46, 74, 608, 17, 4363, 16221, 2954, 2, 8107, 1503, 1998, 123, 96, 117, 794, 9632, 2290, 50, 4363, 32, 1665, 6, 1359, 2290, 2, 3392, 4, 3, 1282, 12693, 653, 2224, 1, 3, 3805, 16, 44, 1493, 9, 2954, 21031, 123, 32, 288, 6, 135, 1, 3, 2252, 711, 5760, 736]",1690.0,22914213,international series abdominal radical trachelectomy 101 patients 28 pregnancies,1,0.005025125628140704
Postoperative pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in intermediate- and high-risk cervical cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-11-15,"According to national surveys, the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in gynecologic cancers is on the rise, yet there is still some reluctance to adopt adjuvant IMRT as standard practice. The purpose of this study is to report a single-institution experience using postoperative pelvic IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy in intermediate- and high-risk early stage cervical cancer. From 1/2004 to 12/2009, 34 patients underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (28 median nodes were removed) for early stage cervical cancer. Median dose of postoperative pelvic IMRT was 50.4 Gy (range, 45-50.4). All patients received concurrent cisplatin. With a median follow-up of 44 months, 3 patients have recurred; 1 vaginal recurrence, 1 regional and distant, and 1 distant. The 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 91.2% (95% CI, 81.4-100%) and overall survival (OS) was 91.1% (95% CI, 81.3-100%). All failures and all deaths were in the high-risk group (n=3/26). There was 32.3% G3-4 hematologic toxicity, 2.9% acute G3 gastrointestinal toxicity, and no acute G3 or higher genitourinary toxicity. There were no chronic G3 or higher toxicities.

Postoperative pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy in high risk endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-11-20,"According to national surveys, the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in gynecologic cancers is on the rise, yet there is still some reluctance to adopt adjuvant IMRT as standard practice. The purpose of this study is to report a single-institution experience using postoperative pelvic IMRT with or without chemotherapy in high-risk endometrial cancer. From 11/2004 to 12/2009, 46 patients underwent hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for stage I-III (22% stage I/II and 78% stage III) endometrial cancer. Median IMRT dose was 50.4Gy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 30 (65%) patients. With a median follow-up of 52months, 4 patients recurred: 1 vaginal plus lung metastasis, 2 isolated para-aortic recurrences, and 1 lungs and liver metastasis. Five-year relapse rate was 9% (95% CI, 0-13.6%). Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 88% (95% CI, 77-98%) and overall survival (OS) was 97% (95% CI, 90-100%). There were 2 patients with non-hematological grade 3 toxicity: 1 (2%) acute and 1 (2%) chronic gastrointestinal toxicity. In patients treated with IMRT and chemotherapy (n=30), 5 had grade 3 leukopenia, 8 grade 2 anemia, and 2 grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Oncologic outcomes with postoperative IMRT were very good, with DFS and OS rates of >88% at median follow-up of 52months, despite a preponderance (78%) of stage III disease.

Oncol.,2012-12-20,"This two-stage phase II study was designed to assess the activity of the combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma (EMC). Eligible patients had persistent or recurrent EMC after receiving 1-2 prior cytotoxic regimens, measurable disease, and Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2. Treatment consisted of bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every other week and temsirolimus 25 mg IV weekly until disease progression or prohibitory toxicity. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at six months and overall response rate using RECIST criteria. Fifty-three patients were enrolled. Forty-nine patients were eligible and evaluable. Median age was 63 years, and prior treatment consisted of one or two regimens in 40 (82%) and 9 (18%), respectively. Twenty (41%) received prior radiation. Adverse events were consistent with those expected with bevacizumab and temsirolimus treatment. Two gastrointestinal-vaginal fistulas, one grade 3 epistaxis, two intestinal perforations and 1 grade 4 thrombosis/embolism were seen. Three patient deaths were possibly treatment related. Twelve patients (24.5%) experienced clinical responses (one complete and 11 partial responses), and 23 patients (46.9%) survived progression free for at least six months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.6 and 16.9 months, respectively. Combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab is deemed active based on both objective tumor response and PFS at six months in recurrent or persistent EMC. However, this treatment regimen was associated with significant toxicity in this pretreated group.

Exemestane versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: NCIC CTG MA.27--a randomized controlled phase III trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-01-28,"In patients with hormone-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer, standard adjuvant therapy involves 5 years of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole. The steroidal inhibitor exemestane is partially non-cross-resistant with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors and is a mild androgen and could prove superior to anastrozole regarding efficacy and toxicity, specifically with less bone loss. We designed an open-label, randomized, phase III trial of 5 years of exemestane versus anastrozole with a two-sided test of superiority to detect a 2.4% improvement with exemestane in 5-year event-free survival (EFS). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival, distant disease-free survival, incidence of contralateral new primary breast cancer, and safety. In the study, 7,576 women (median age, 64.1 years) were enrolled. At median follow-up of 4.1 years, 4-year EFS was 91% for exemestane and 91.2% for anastrozole (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.18; P = .85). Overall, distant disease-free survival and disease-specific survival were also similar. In all, 31.6% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of adverse effects, concomitant disease, or study refusal. Osteoporosis/osteopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, vaginal bleeding, and hypercholesterolemia were less frequent on exemestane, whereas mild liver function abnormalities and rare episodes of atrial fibrillation were less frequent on anastrozole. Vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were similar between arms. This first comparison of steroidal and nonsteroidal classes of aromatase inhibitors showed neither to be superior in terms of breast cancer outcomes as 5-year initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer by two-way test. Less toxicity on bone is compatible with one hypothesis behind MA.27 but requires confirmation.

Gynecol.,2013-02-01,"The purpose of this study was to review a large cohort of patients with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) and to analyze the epidemiology and outcomes with various treatment modalities. A retrospective chart review was performed that encompassed patients who were treated for VAIN at a single center from 1990-2007. Demographics, disease characteristics, referring cytology, and histologic information were recorded. Primary outcome was recurrence or progression to carcinoma. Statistical analyses were performed with statistical software. One hundred sixty-three women were included in the study: median age, 50 years (range, 21-84 years); white, 87%; current or previous smokers, 35%. At the time of diagnosis, 23% of the women had VAIN1; 37% of the women had VAIN2, and 35% of the women had VAIN3. Referral Papanicolaou smear results of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or atypical glandular cells revealed VAIN2 or VAIN3 in 89% of cases (P = .0019) vs 53% of cases with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The median follow-up period was 18 months (range, 1-194 months). VAIN1 was observed in 70% of cases; 71% of patients who were treated for VAIN1 had recurrence or progression. VAIN2 was treated in 77% of patients; 53% of those who were treated had recurrence or progression. VAIN3 was treated in 94% of cases; 31% of them had recurrence or progression. Risk of recurrence was not correlated to VAIN type (P = .3). Six carcinomas were discovered in patients with VAIN2 and VAIN3. Median time to progression was 17 months for VAIN1, 11 months for VAIN2, and 11 months for VAIN3 (P = .036).

"The physical consequences of gynecologic cancer surgery and their impact on sexual, emotional, and quality of life issues.",The journal of sexual medicine,J Sex Med,2013-02-01,"Surgical management of gynecologic cancer can cause short- and long-term effects on sexuality, reproductive function, and overall quality of life (QOL) (e.g., sexual dysfunction, infertility, lymphedema). However, innovative approaches developed over the past several decades have improved oncologic outcomes and reduced treatment sequelae. To provide an overview of the standards of care and major advancements in gynecologic cancer surgery, with a focus on their direct physical impact, as well as emotional, sexual, and QOL issues. This overview will aid researchers and clinicians in the conceptualization of future clinical care strategies and interventions to improve sexual/vaginal/reproductive health and QOL in gynecologic cancer patients. Comprehensive overview of the literature on gynecologic oncology surgery. Conceptual framework for this overview follows the current standards of care and recent surgical approaches to treat gynecologic cancer, with a brief overview describing primary management objectives and the physical, sexual, and emotional impact on patients. Extensive literature support is provided. The type and radicality of surgical treatment for gynecologic cancer can influence sexual function and play a significant role in QOL. Psychological, sexual, and QOL outcomes improve as surgical procedures continue to evolve. Procedures for fertility preservation, laparoscopy, sentinel lymph node mapping, and robotic and risk-reducing surgery have advanced the field while reducing treatment sequelae. Nevertheless, interventions that address sexual and vaginal health issues are limited. It is imperative to consider QOL and sexuality during the treatment decision-making process.

Anastrozole-associated joint pain and other symptoms in patients with breast cancer.,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,J Pain,2013-03-01,"More than a third of breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment report joint pain. We conducted a longitudinal study to characterize the course of AI-induced joint pain and other symptoms and to identify potential predictors for developing these symptoms. Patients were recruited before AI initiation. The Brief Pain Inventory, M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, and a joint-pain questionnaire were administered at baseline and then biweekly for 1 year. Analysis included logistic regression, Cox models, and mixed-effects models. Of 47 patients assessed, 16 (34%) reported joint pain at least once. Median time to first report of joint pain was 7 weeks (range, 1-38). Baseline pain was the only predictor for both incidence of joint pain and time to first event. In the first 6 weeks, emergence of joint pain was associated with increase in general pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased sexual activity. After week 6, having joint pain was associated with increase in general pain and with persistently high fatigue. Having AI-associated joint pain correlated with increase in or persistence of other symptoms likely related to AI therapy. Further research is needed to validate predictors of AI-associated symptoms. We demonstrate for the first time that AI-induced joint pain associates with development of other symptoms and that pretreatment pain level is a potential, measurable predictor of symptom development during treatment. Because baseline pain is easily assessed with a brief questionnaire, it can be applied clinically with minimal patient burden.",Journal Article,2517.0,14.0,breast patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor AI treatment report joint pain conducted longitudinal characterize course AI-induced joint pain symptoms identify potential predictors developing symptoms Patients recruited AI initiation Brief Pain Inventory M.

Sixty-five patients were treated at a single institution with IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy for localized squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Radiotherapy was delivered with a simultaneous integrated boost technique, with dose based on the T stage. The median dose to the primary tumor and pelvis were 54 Gy (range, 50 to 58.8 Gy) and 45 Gy (range, 40.5 to 50.4 Gy), respectively. The most common concurrent chemotherapy regimens were 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (75%), capecitabine and oxaliplatin (11%), and 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C (5%).

A retrospective chart review was performed at 2 institutions to identify women receiving treatment for vaginal cancer between 1990 and 2004. Demographics, risk factors, histology, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, treatment, and treatment-related complications were recorded. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.2 was used. A total of 110 patients were identified in the 2 university databases. Median age was 63 years (range = 36-93 years), and 84% were white; 73% had squamous cell carcinoma, 40% were ever users of tobacco, and 64% had no abnormal Pap smear results. Of the patients, 83% had early-stage (I or II) disease. Treatment varied by stage with increasing use of radiation with advancing stage. Recurrence was 24%, 32%, and 53% for stage I, II, and III/IV disease, respectively. After a median follow-up of 21 months, progression-free survival was 59, 35, and 23 months for stage I, II, and III/IV disease, respectively.

Age greater than 60 years (p = .0339; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.162), advanced stage (p = .0004; HR = 2.475), and tobacco use (p = .0004; HR = 1.02) were negatively associated with survival. Thirty percent developed a significant complication (fistula, stricture, cystitis, or proctitis), and 21% developed a vesicovaginal and/or rectovaginal fistula.

Postoperative pain medication requirements in patients undergoing computer-assisted (“Robotic”) and standard laparoscopic procedures for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2013-10-01,"Laparoscopy (LSC) offers superior patient outcomes compared to laparotomy. Small retrospective/prospective series have suggested robotics offers further reduction in postoperative pain and pain medication use compared to standard LSC. Our objective was to compare postoperative pain in patients undergoing robotically assisted (RBT) versus standard LSC for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. All preoperative endometrial cancer cases scheduled for RBT and LSC from May 1, 2007 to June 9, 2010 were identified. For this analysis, we only included cases not requiring conversion to laparotomy. All patients were offered intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively. Intraoperative equivalent fentanyl doses (IEFDs) and pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were assessed. IV PCA was used in 206 RBTs (86 %) and 208 LSCs (88 %). Median IEFD was 425 μg for LSCs and 500 μg for RBTs (P = 0.03). Median pain scores on PACU arrival were similar in both groups. Median highest pain score was 5 for LSCs and 4 for RBTs (P = 0.007). Linear regression demonstrated that the IEFD was not correlated with the highest pain score (R = 0.09; P = 0.07). Fentanyl was used postoperatively in 196 of 206 RBTs (95 %) and 187 of 208 LSCs (90 %). The total fentanyl doses were 242.5 (range 0-2705) μg and 380 (range 0-2625) μg, respectively (P < 0.001). The median hourly fentanyl doses were 16.7 (range 0-122.5) μg and 23.5 (range 0-132.4) μg, respectively (P = 0.005). Simultaneous multiple regression analysis further demonstrated RBT was independently associated with a lower total fentanyl dose compared to LSC (P = 0.02). RBT is independently associated with significantly lower postoperative pain and pain medication requirements compared to LSC. The amount of intraoperative fentanyl analgesia does not appear to correlate with postoperative pain.Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with an estimated 47,130 new cases in 2012.1 An estimated 287,100 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide in 2008.2 Surgery is the primary treatment of choice for the majority of these women.3 The standard surgical approach has been total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging via laparotomy. Multiple retrospective series have shown that a less invasive surgical approach via laparoscopy (LSC) is feasible and safe, and also associated with improved perioperative outcomes compared to laparotomy in these patients.4 The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) published results of the largest randomized trial (LAP2) comparing LSC to laparotomy in patients with newly diagnosed endometrial carcinoma in 2009.5,6 This landmark study essentially changed the accepted standard surgical approach in this group. Postoperative complications, median blood loss, and median length of stay (LOS), despite increased operative time, were significantly lower in LSC patients despite 25 % requiring conversion to laparotomy.5 The first 802 eligible patients randomized in LAP2 also participated in a quality-of-life (QOL) study. Within 6 weeks of surgery, patients assigned to LSC reported significantly better QOL on all scales other than fear of recurrence.6 Overall, during this 6-week postoperative period, patients assigned to LSC had superior QOL, fewer physical symptoms, less pain and pain-related interference with functioning, better physical functioning and emotional state, earlier resumption of normal activities, earlier return to work, and better body image compared to those assigned to laparotomy.6 Recurrence-free and overall survivals were the same in both groups.7 Multiple published retrospective series have shown possible benefits, such as reduced postoperative pain, using the robotic (RBT) platform compared to LSC or laparotomy in patients with endometrial cancer.8-11 In a randomized trial, LSC was found to be associated with less postoperative pain compared to vaginal approaches in patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease.12 A small retrospective series reported further reductions in postoperative pain in patients who had undergone an RBT hysterectomy compared to a standard total LSC hysterectomy for benign indications.13 A recent cost analysis suggested that patients experienced less pain and required less pain medication use after RBT procedures compared to LSC for endometrial cancer.14 Based on these reports, we sought to analyze postoperative pain and the use of pain medication in patients undergoing RBT compared to standard transperitoneal LSC procedures for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer during a concurrent time period. Of note, current RBT surgery is not truly robotic in that it is not autonomous. A more appropriate term is “computer-assisted surgery,” but to satisfy current convention, we refer to it as “robotic surgery” in this manuscript.",Comparative Study,2303.0,36.0,"Laparoscopy LSC

Postoperative external beam radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel for stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-06-22,"The optimal adjuvant therapy in advanced endometrial cancer is controversial. One regimen is concurrent external beam pelvic irradiation (RT) and cisplatin, then carboplatin/paclitaxel. This study reports an institutional experience using this approach in stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer. Patients with stage III (FIGO 2009) endometrial cancer who underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at a single institution from 01/2004 to 12/2009 were identified retrospectively. Those treated with adjuvant RT/cisplatin, followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel comprised the study population. Of the 40 eligible patients, 7 (18%) were stage IIIA and 33 (82%) IIIC. Nineteen patients (48%) were ≥ 60 years of age. Twenty-three (58%) had ≥ 50% myometrial invasion, 30 (75%) lymphovascular invasion, 11 (28%) cervical stromal invasion, and 5 (12%) positive peritoneal cytology. Histology was endometrioid in 32 (80%), serous in 6 (15%), and clear cell in 2 (5%). At a median follow-up of 49 months, the 5-year freedom from relapse was 79% and overall survival 85%. The 5-year rate of vaginal recurrence was 3%, non-vaginal pelvic recurrence 3%, para-aortic recurrence 11%, peritoneal recurrence 5%, and other distant recurrence 11%.

Oncol.,2013-08-15,"Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the vagina is a rare malignancy with limited data to guide treatment. We evaluated prognostic factors and outcomes for patients with primary vaginal SCCA treated with definitive radiation therapy at a single institution. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients treated for primary vaginal SCCA from 1959 to 2011. Ninety-one patients with primary vaginal SCCA were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Thirty-eight patients had FIGO stage I, 28 stage II, 13 stage III, and 12 stage IV disease. The mean total dose was 70.1 Gy. Two-year overall survival (OS), locoregional control rate (LRC), and distant metastasis-free survival by stage were, respectively: stage I: 96.2%, 80.6%, 87.5%; stage II: 92.3%, 64.7%, 84.6%; stage III: 66.6%, 44.4%, 50.0%; and stage IV: 25.0%, 14.3%, 25.0%. Treatment with total dose over 70 Gy was associated with improved OS (p=0.0956) and LRC (p=0.055). There was a significant difference in median dose received by patients who developed grade 3/4 toxicity compared to those who did not (82.9 Gy versus 70.0 Gy, p=0.0019). None of the 10 patients treated with IMRT experienced locoregional recurrence or grade 3/4 toxicity. Tumor size larger than 4 cm was associated with worse OS (p=0.0034) and LRC (p=0.006). Our analysis suggests that the optimal dose for definitive treatment of SCCA of the vagina lies between 70 and 80 Gy. Treatment with IMRT may allow for dose escalation with reduced toxicity and excellent LRC.

Oncol.,2013-09-20,"To evaluate patterns of relapse in early stage uterine papillary carcinoma (UPSC) patients receiving adjuvant intravaginal radiotherapy (IVRT) with or without chemotherapy. From 1/1996 to 12/2010, 77 women with stage I-II UPSC underwent surgery followed by IVRT (median 21Gy). Stage IA patients without residual disease at surgery were excluded. IVRT and chemotherapy (carboplatin/taxane) was given to 61 (79%) patients and IVRT alone to 16 (21%). The median follow-up was 62 months for surviving patients. Of the 77 patients, 11 (14%) relapsed as follows: vaginal 2 (3%), pelvic 5 (6%), para-aortic 5 (6%), peritoneal 6 (8%), and other distant sites 8 (10%). Of the 5 pelvic relapses, 2 were isolated and were salvaged. In those treated without chemotherapy, only 1/16 developed recurrence (mediastinal). The 5-year vaginal, pelvic, para-aortic, peritoneal, and distant recurrence rates were 2.7% (C.I. 0-6.2%), 5.8% (C.I. 0.6-11.0%), 5.4% (C.I. 0.6-10.1%), 5.3% (C.I. 0.5-10.1%) and 6.6% (C.I. 1.4-11.8%), respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 88% (C.I. 81-95%), and 91% (C.I. 84-97%), respectively. The only predictor of worse 5-year pelvic control was stage (96.2% stage IA vs 87.7% for stage IB-II, p=0.043).

Reducing readmissions after robotic surgical management of endometrial cancer: a potential for improved quality care.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-10-04,"To describe readmission patterns after robotic surgery for endometrial cancer and identify risk factors for readmission within 90 days of discharge. Patients with endometrial cancer who underwent robotic surgical management at an academic institution from 2006 to 2010 were identified. Patient characteristics, intraoperative data, and postoperative complications were analyzed. Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare patients readmitted within 90 days to those who were not. Three hundred ninety-five patients were included. Thirty (7.6%) were readmitted within 90 days of surgical discharge. Length of stay greater than one day (40.0% vs. 23.0%, p=0.04) and postoperative complication (63.3% vs. 13.4%, p<0.01) were associated with readmission. The median interval to readmission was 9.5 days and median duration of subsequent hospitalization was 2.5 days. Fever (31.3%) and workup for vaginal drainage (25.0%) were the most common reasons for readmission. Only 2 of the 10 patients readmitted with fever had culture-proven infection, and no patients readmitted for vaginal drainage had a confirmed urinary tract injury. Of the 30 patients readmitted, 5 required a second operation - 3 for vaginal cuff dehiscence and 2 for port site hernia. Robotic surgery for endometrial cancer was associated with a 7.6% readmission rate.

Outcomes in patients with mucosal melanomas.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2013-10-16,"Our goal was to evaluate the different subtypes of mucosal melanoma and describe specific variables that predict outcomes. Prospective review of two tertiary care center databases identified 76 mucosal melanoma patients; 73 with complete records were included. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Cox regression determined variables impacting recurrence and survival. In the 73 patients, the mean age was 64 years, and 74% were female. Sixty-seven percent presented with lymph node involvement, and 73% had ulcerated tumors. Major sites affected were nasal/palate/oral (36%), vulvar/vaginal/cervical (48%), and anorectal (15%). Mean overall and disease-free survival were 56.9 and 27.2 months. Variables associated with decreased survival included: lymphovascular invasion (HR17.70, P = 0.0093), Caucasian race (HR3.02, P = 0.0362), nasal/palate/oral sub-group (HR1.85, P = 0.026), Breslow thickness (HR1.23, P = 0.00004), T stage (HR1.34, P = 0.0075), M stage (HR3.03, P = 0.0039), and chemotherapy (HR3.13, P = 0.0002). The worst prognosis was seen in the nasal/palate/oral sub-group, with a median overall survival of 9.7 months and recurrence-free time of 4.5 months.

Phase II trial of vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed by chemotherapy in early stage endometrial cancer patients with high-intermediate risk factors.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-11-09,"To determine the progression free survival (PFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure for early stage, high-intermediate risk (H-IR) patients in a phase II trial with adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCB) and three cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Surgically staged patients with stage I-IIb endometrial cancer with H-IR factors were treated with VCB (2100cGy) followed by three cycles of carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)). The primary endpoint was PFS at 2 years, with toxicity and sites of failure as secondary endpoints. Toxicity was assessed by patient report (CTCAE v. 3) as well as by delays or dose modifications in treatment. All patients completed VCB and 19/23 (83%) completed both VCB and 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Mean time to complete VCB was 14.5 days with minimal acute toxicity noted. At 6 months, all toxicity related to VCB had resolved. In total 60 cycles of chemotherapy were given, with one dose reduction (1.6%) for grade 2 neuropathy and seven delays (11.6%) in treatment due to hematologic toxicity. At a median follow-up of 44.5 months, 91% of patients remained progression free at 2 years. Four patients experienced a recurrence; they recurred both locally and distant. Adjuvant therapy with VCB and chemotherapy is well tolerated in a population of patients with H-IR endometrial carcinoma and provides 2 year PFS of 91%. A randomized trial is currently underway to assess whether combined VCB and chemotherapy reduces the rate of recurrence compared to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in this patient population.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2264.0,20.0,determine progression free survival PFS toxicity patterns failure early stage high-intermediate risk H-IR patients phase II trial adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy VCB cycles carboplatin paclitaxel Surgically staged patients stage I-IIb endometrial H-IR factors treated VCB 2100cGy followed cycles carboplatin AUC 6 paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 primary endpoint PFS 2 years toxicity sites failure secondary endpoints Toxicity assessed patient report CTCAE v. 3 delays dose modifications treatment patients completed VCB 19/23 83 completed VCB 3 cycles chemotherapy Mean time complete VCB 14.5 days minimal acute toxicity noted 6 months toxicity related VCB resolved total 60 cycles chemotherapy given dose reduction 1.6 grade 2 neuropathy seven delays 11.6 treatment hematologic toxicity median follow-up 44.5 months 91 patients remained progression free 2 years patients experienced recurrence recurred locally distant Adjuvant therapy VCB chemotherapy tolerated population patients H-IR endometrial carcinoma provides 2 year PFS 91 randomized trial currently underway assess combined VCB chemotherapy reduces rate recurrence compared external beam radiation therapy EBRT patient population,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 91, 115, 25, 300, 155, 2, 764, 1, 496, 9, 191, 82, 64, 919, 43, 555, 2123, 7, 4, 8, 124, 215, 160, 5, 249, 11445, 1536, 25573, 2, 169, 410, 1, 927, 2, 490, 2350, 2930, 7, 5, 82, 70, 3884, 12, 5, 555, 2123, 130, 11, 73, 5, 25573, 63608, 370, 20, 169, 410, 1, 927, 1376, 49, 2, 490, 3300, 81, 188, 18, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 300, 28, 18, 60, 5, 155, 2, 633, 1, 496, 22, 568, 1387, 155, 10, 275, 20, 69, 414, 3898, 603, 27, 22, 149, 22, 20, 3257, 15, 61, 2916, 4, 24, 62, 7, 781, 25573, 2, 326, 382, 852, 781, 110, 25573, 2, 27, 410, 1, 56, 313, 98, 6, 236, 25573, 10, 213, 33, 162, 5, 1048, 286, 155, 1051, 28, 49, 53, 62, 155, 139, 6, 25573, 42, 3862, 4, 181, 335, 410, 1, 56, 11, 447, 5, 104, 61, 628, 14, 49, 9, 88, 18, 1751, 2, 648, 3257, 175, 49, 4, 24, 520, 6, 813, 155, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 584, 33, 53, 970, 1, 7, 958, 91, 115, 28, 18, 60, 294, 7, 592, 8, 146, 491, 3363, 110, 795, 2, 626, 249, 36, 5, 25573, 2, 56, 16, 149, 421, 4, 8, 266, 1, 7, 5, 555, 2123, 134, 2, 777, 18, 111, 300, 1, 970, 8, 384, 160, 16, 694, 3948, 6, 423, 317, 397, 25573, 2, 56, 2389, 3, 116, 1, 146, 72, 6, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 1883, 4, 26, 69, 266]",1489.0,24219982,Phase II trial vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed chemotherapy early stage endometrial patients high-intermediate risk factors,3,0.01507537688442211

Baseline characteristics, surgical outcomes, early (<60 days) and late (≥ 60 days) postoperative complications, and recurrence/survival outcomes were ascertained. Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared. 161 patients were included (58 young, 62 in the middle, and 41 senior). Women in the young group predominately had a diagnosis of cervical cancer (82.8%) while women in the senior group primarily had a diagnosis of vulvar or vaginal cancer (70.7%). Senior women were also more likely to have hypertension (p < 0.0001) and pulmonary disease (p = 0.040). Operative time was significantly shorter for women in the senior group (8.5h) compared with the middle (9.5h) and young group (10.1h) (p = 0.0089). There were no significant differences in early or late complications when stratified by age. The overall survival did not differ between age groups (p = 0.3760).

Causes and palliation of transfusion-associated vaginal bleeding in patients with metastatic cancer.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-01-01,"The current study was undertaken (1) to capture a clinically relevant, systematically collected series of patients with metastatic cancer and transfusion-associated vaginal bleeding and (2) to provide insight into how best to palliate this bleeding. As part of a single-institution review, 46 patients with metastatic cancer and transfusion-associated vaginal bleeding were identified. In a minority, 14 (30%), the cancer itself was directly responsible for the bleeding, and under these circumstances, gynecological cancer was the most frequent cause. In 13 patients (28%), more than 1 palliative intervention was attempted. Of all the interventions, a hysterectomy was performed most frequently and was successful in 11 patients.

We hypothesize that mucosal melanoma shows predilection for separate and unique metastatic pathways. This was a retrospective analysis of 19 patients (5 men and 14 women; median age 60 years, range 38-76 years) with metastatic mucosal melanoma presenting to a tertiary oncology center between 2005 and 2010. We performed a review of medical records and histologic and imaging studies to evaluate the natural history, metastatic patterns and the role of imaging in the management of patients with advanced mucosal melanoma. At presentation, disease was confined to the primary site (58%, n = 11) or to the regional lymph nodes (32%, n = 6) in most patients. The most common site of metastasis was the lungs (89%, n = 16), followed by the liver (67%, n = 12) and peritoneum (44%, n = 8). Sinonasal melanoma preferentially spread to the liver (100%, n = 4), vaginal melanoma to the lungs (100%, n = 7) and anal melanoma to the inguinal lymph nodes (100%, n = 4).

Each survey was composed of the Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors instrument, Menopause Symptom Scale, and questions aimed at obtaining pertinent background information. One thousand ninety patients completed the survey. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 39.5 years; median years from diagnosis was 6.6 years. Distress related to vaginal dryness (P = .0002) and pain from intercourse (P = .0014) was significantly higher in patients who were < 5 years from diagnosis compared with those > 10 years from diagnosis. In the area of financial problems, black women had greater distress than did white women (P = .0010). Compared with white women, Hispanic women had worse family distress scores (P = .0028) and summary cancer-specific scores (P = .0076).

Key clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based guideline on endometrial cancer were identified. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify studies that included no adjuvant therapy, or pelvic radiation or vaginal brachytherapy with or without systemic chemotherapy. Outcomes included local control, survival rates, and overall assessment of quality of life. Patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with either no invasion or <50% myometrial invasion (MI), especially when no other high risk features are present, can be safely observed after hysterectomy. Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence for patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with ≥50% MI or grade 3 tumors with <50% MI. Patients with grade 3 cancer with ≥50% MI or cervical stroma invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence. There is limited evidence for a benefit to vaginal cuff brachytherapy following pelvic radiation.

Data are often extrapolated from other cutaneous melanomas, which may or may not be appropriate. Surgery remains the primary treatment modality at initial diagnosis and in select recurrent cases. Wide local excision of the primary lesion not requiring an exenteration, along with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, should be routinely considered in vulvar melanomas. Local excision and SLN mapping is difficult and often not considered for vaginal melanomas. Primary exenterative procedures should not be routinely offered. In locally advanced cases potentially requiring an exenterative procedure, radiation therapy with or without concurrent immunotherapy is a consideration. The role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Surgery or radiation therapy can be considered in recurrent cases. Systemic chemotherapy agents have a modest response rate with associated poor survival outcomes.

Treatment-related amenorrhea and sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-05-28,"Sexual dysfunction is a known complication of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and an important determinant of quality of life. However, few studies have explored how treatment and other factors affect sexual functioning in young breast cancer survivors. Four hundred sixty-one premenopausal women with stage 0 through III breast cancer were surveyed an average of 1 year after diagnosis as part of a prospective cohort study of women who were aged ≤40 years at diagnosis. Sexual interest and dysfunction were assessed using the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES). Mean CARES scores were compared and multiple regression models were fit to assess treatment and a range of menopausal and somatic symptoms in relation to sexual functioning. Mean CARES sexual interest and dysfunction scores were both highest (indicating poorer functioning) among women who received chemotherapy and were amenorrheic from treatment. After accounting for menopausal and somatic symptoms, treatment-associated amenorrhea remained associated with decreased interest but was no longer an independent predictor of dysfunction. In the multivariable analysis, independent predictors of dysfunction included vaginal pain symptoms, poorer body image, and fatigue. Sexual interest was associated with vaginal pain symptoms, body image, and weight problems.

Patient preferences for side effects associated with cervical cancer treatment.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-07-01,"The aim of this study was to assess patient preferences regarding side effects associated with cervical cancer treatment. The visual analog scale (VAS) and modified standard gamble (SG) were used to elicit preferences of women with no evidence of disease after primary treatment of cervical cancer. Higher scores on VAS and SG indicated more favorable ratings for a given health state. Health states (HS) included vaginal shortening, diarrhea, dietary changes, menopause, moderate nausea/vomiting, rectal bleeding, sexual dysfunction, and urinary self-catheterization. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests and correlation coefficients were used for statistical analysis. Seventy-eight patients participated in the study. Median age was 44.1 years (range, 24.9-67.8 years). Median time since treatment completion was 31.2 months (range, 1.0-113.3 months). The HSs rated as most favorable by VAS were also rated as most favorable by SG. Increasing age was associated with higher VAS scores for menopause and vaginal shortening (P = 0.04 and 0.036). African Americans had higher VAS scores for dietary changes (P = 0.05), sexual dysfunction (P = 0.028), and diarrhea (P = 0.05) when compared with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. Women receiving radiation had more favorable VAS scores for menopause compared with women undergoing radical hysterectomy (P = 0.05). Women receiving chemotherapy rated urinary self-catheterization less favorably by VAS score compared with those not receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.045).

Extended therapy with letrozole and ovarian suppression in premenopausal patients with breast cancer after tamoxifen.,Clinical breast cancer,Clin. Breast Cancer,2014-06-02,"In premenopausal women with breast cancer, standard adjuvant endocrine therapy has been 5 years of tamoxifen. This study sought to investigate the safety and feasibility of treating patients who remain premenopausal after adjuvant tamoxifen with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) concurrent with an aromatase inhibitor, mimicking the strategy that has proven effective in postmenopausal patients. This phase II single-arm clinical trial aimed to enroll 50 premenopausal women who had completed > 4.5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen for a 2-year course of leuprolide (7.5 mg intramuscularly monthly or 22.5 mg intramuscularly every 3 months) and letrozole (2.5 mg orally daily). Zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 6 months) was offered optionally to help prevent bone loss. Despite aggressive recruitment strategies at the 3 participating sites (including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), poor accrual over 3.5 years ultimately led to early study closure after only 16 patients began therapy. Of the 16, 4 stopped treatment before 1 year, owing to toxicity; 5 completed 2 years of protocol-directed therapy; and 7 remained on treatment as of September 1, 2013, for an average of 53.5 weeks (SD, 17.2 weeks). Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and pain were common toxicities. Extended therapy with GnRH-a and an aromatase inhibitor (plus optional bisphosphonate) is associated with substantial side effects in premenopausal women who have already completed > 4.5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. This study's poor accrual suggests that young women may not be highly motivated to pursue lengthier courses of endocrine therapy and that future studies of this approach may be challenging.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2059.0,8.0,premenopausal women breast standard adjuvant endocrine therapy 5 years tamoxifen sought investigate safety feasibility treating patients remain premenopausal adjuvant tamoxifen gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist GnRH-a concurrent aromatase inhibitor mimicking strategy proven effective postmenopausal patients phase II single-arm clinical trial aimed enroll 50 premenopausal women completed 4.5 years adjuvant tamoxifen 2-year course leuprolide 7.5 mg intramuscularly monthly 22.5 mg intramuscularly 3 months letrozole 2.5 mg orally daily Zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously 6 months offered optionally help prevent bone loss Despite aggressive recruitment strategies 3 participating sites including Dana-Farber Institute poor accrual 3.5 years ultimately led early closure 16 patients began therapy 16 4 stopped treatment 1 year owing toxicity 5 completed 2 years protocol-directed therapy 7 remained treatment September 1 2013 average 53.5 weeks SD 17.2 weeks Hot flashes vaginal dryness pain common toxicities Extended therapy GnRH-a aromatase inhibitor plus optional bisphosphonate associated substantial effects premenopausal women completed 4.5 years adjuvant tamoxifen 's poor accrual suggests young women highly motivated pursue lengthier courses endocrine therapy future studies approach challenging,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 2710, 117, 5, 12, 260, 249, 1293, 36, 71, 85, 33, 60, 1, 1105, 26, 45, 990, 6, 963, 3, 367, 2, 1437, 1, 1367, 7, 54, 918, 2710, 50, 249, 1105, 5, 6501, 5586, 785, 3821, 7926, 8, 750, 5, 35, 2106, 230, 8191, 3, 692, 17, 71, 1930, 323, 4, 1679, 7, 26, 124, 215, 226, 475, 38, 160, 1295, 6, 6559, 212, 2710, 117, 54, 42, 781, 39, 33, 60, 1, 249, 1105, 9, 8, 18, 111, 906, 1, 13106, 67, 33, 81, 12800, 3889, 15, 350, 33, 81, 12800, 454, 27, 53, 2, 2800, 18, 33, 81, 1428, 391, 4055, 971, 39, 81, 1672, 454, 49, 53, 10, 2216, 40486, 6, 987, 1682, 407, 550, 571, 3202, 422, 28, 3, 27, 3052, 633, 141, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 334, 2262, 252, 27, 33, 60, 2050, 836, 6, 191, 45, 4830, 50, 158, 245, 7, 4603, 36, 1, 3, 245, 39, 4403, 24, 348, 14, 111, 3421, 6, 155, 33, 781, 18, 60, 1, 1182, 1166, 36, 2, 67, 958, 23, 24, 22, 1, 2636, 14, 1346, 9, 35, 1011, 1, 699, 33, 244, 1270, 269, 18, 244, 2859, 4193, 15822, 2, 559, 11, 186, 385, 1747, 36, 5, 7926, 8, 2, 35, 2106, 230, 349, 9281, 7110, 16, 41, 5, 1281, 1152, 176, 4, 2710, 117, 54, 47, 3298, 781, 39, 33, 60, 1, 249, 1105, 26, 45, 292, 334, 2262, 844, 17, 1169, 117, 68, 44, 40, 561, 9252, 6, 7874, 64553, 1993, 1, 1293, 36, 2, 17, 508, 94, 1, 26, 353, 68, 40, 1950]",1632.0,24970714,Extended therapy letrozole ovarian suppression premenopausal patients breast tamoxifen,0,0.0

We conducted a single institution retrospective review of patients who had undergone a complete PE for locally recurrent gynecologic cancer. Demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected. 32 patients were identified (2000-2012); 21 (66%) cervical cancer, 8 (25%) vaginal, and 3 (9%) vulvar cancer. All patients were previously irradiated. Twenty-one (66%) received IORT. Mean age was 51. Eight patients had a LEER, all with IORT. Median PFS and OS, respectively, for those with PE alone was 33 and 41 vs. 10 and 10 months for PE+IORT compared to 9 and 17 months for LEER+IORT (P=.04). Increasing tumor size negatively impacted PFS (hazard ratio 1.3; 95%CI 1.12-1.52). Margin status was not associated with survival. No patients undergoing LEER+IORT recurred only locally whereas 62% recurred with a distant component (+/- local). Patients with PE alone had mainly local (36%) and few (9%) distant recurrences compared to 31% local and 38% distant (+/- local) recurrences for those with PE+IORT. We failed to demonstrate that IORT changes survival and recurrence outcomes.

Definitive salvage for vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer: the impact of modern intensity-modulated-radiotherapy with image-based HDR brachytherapy and the interplay of the PORTEC 1 risk stratification.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2014-09-18,"Data for salvage radiotherapy for recurrent endometrial cancer are limited especially in the era of modern radiotherapy including IMRT and 3-dimensional image-based HDR brachytherapy. Theoretically, modern radiotherapy reduces the dose to critical organs-at-risk and maximizes dose to the target volume, possibly decreasing morbidity and increasing tumor control. Forty-one patients completing definitive salvage radiotherapy for vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer from June 2004 to December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. HDR Brachytherapy was completed using image-based planning with contouring/optimization with each fraction to a median dose of 23.75 Gy in 5 fractions. HDR brachytherapy was preceded by external beam radiotherapy predominately using an IMRT technique (90%) to a median dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Toxicity was reported according to CTCAEv4. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range: 3-78), the clinical complete response rate was 95%. The 3-year local control, distant control, recurrence free survival, and overall survival were 95%, 61%, 68%, and 67%.

Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) consensus review for uterine and ovarian carcinosarcoma.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2014-11-01,"Carcinosarcomas (also known as malignant mixed müllerian tumors) are rare and highly aggressive epithelial malignancies that contain both malignant sarcomatous and carcinomatous elements. Uterine carcinosarcomas (UCs) are uncommon with approximately more than 35% presenting with extra uterine disease at diagnosis. Up to 90% ovarian carcinosarcomas (OCs) will have disease that has spread beyond the ovary. Prognosis for localized stage disease is poor with a high risk of recurrences, both local and distant, occurring within 1 year. The survival of women with advanced UC or OC is worse than survival of endometrioid or high-grade serous histologies. No improvement in survival rates has been observed in the past few decades with an overall median survival of less than 2 years. Currently, there is no clear evidence to establish consensus guidelines for therapeutic management of carcinosarcomas. Until recently, gynecological carcinosarcomas were considered as a subtype of sarcoma and treated as such. However, carcinosarcomas are now known to be metaplastic carcinomas and so should be treated as endometrial or ovarian high-risk carcinomas, despite the lack of specific data. For UCs, a comprehensive approach to management is recommended with complete surgical staging followed by systemic chemotherapy in patients with both early and advanced stage disease. Active agents include paraplatin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel. The combination of carboplatin-paclitaxel is the most commonly used regimen in the adjuvant and advanced setting. Adjuvant radiotherapy (external beam irradiation and/or vaginal brachytherapy) has not shown any overall survival benefit but has been reported to decrease local recurrences. For OCs and for other ovarian epithelial cancer, the mainstay of treatment remains cytoreductive surgical effort followed, even in early stage, by platinum-based chemotherapy, usually carboplatin-paclitaxel.

Clinical and treatment factors associated with vaginal stenosis after definitive chemoradiation for anal canal cancer.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2014-10-30,"We sought to evaluate the incidence of vaginal stenosis (VS) and identify clinical and treatment factors that predict for VS in female patients with anal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation. The cohort included 95 consecutive women receiving definitive chemoradiation between 2003 and 2012. All but 1 received intensity modulated radiation therapy; median primary tumor dose 50.4 Gy (range, 41.4-60). A modified National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 was used to score VS based on the medical record description of dyspareunia, pain with dilator use, vaginal dryness, or difficult pelvic examination. Ordered logistic regression was performed to assess VS predictors. Median age was 60.4 years (range, 19-97). With median follow-up of 2.5 years, 70 women (74%) had adequate information to assess VS. Of these, VS grade distribution was 21.4% grade 0, 14.3% grade 1, 27.1% grade 2, and 37.1% grade 3. By multivariable ordered logistic regression, younger age (P = .02), higher tumor dose (P = .06), and earlier treatment year (P = .04) were associated with higher grade of VS. VS is a common late complication in women treated definitively with chemoradiation for anal canal cancer. Younger age, higher tumor dose, and earlier year of treatment were associated with a higher grade of stenosis.

Detection of somatic TP53 mutations in tampons of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2014-11-01,"To investigate whether tumor cells could be detected in the vagina of women with serous ovarian cancer through TP53 analysis of DNA samples collected by placement of a vaginal tampon. Women undergoing surgery for a pelvic mass were identified in the gynecologic oncology clinic. They placed a vaginal tampon before surgery, which was removed in the operating room. Cells were isolated and DNA was extracted from both the cells trapped within the tampon and the primary tumor. In patients with serous carcinoma, the DNA was interrogated for the presence of TP53 mutations using a method capable of detecting rare mutant alleles in a mixture of mutant and wild-type DNA. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. Eight patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer were included for analysis. Three had a prior tubal ligation. TP53 mutations were identified in all eight tumor samples. Analysis of the DNA from the tampons revealed mutations in three of the five patients with intact tubes (sensitivity 60%) and in none of the three patients with tubal ligation. In all three participants with mutation detected in the tampon specimen, the tumor and the vaginal DNA harbored the exact same TP53 mutation. The fraction of DNA derived from exfoliated tumor cells ranged from 0.01% to 0.07%. In this pilot study, DNA derived from tumor was detected in the vaginas of 60% of patients with ovarian cancer with intact fallopian tubes.

Image-based multichannel vaginal cylinder brachytherapy for vaginal cancer.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2014-11-12,"To investigate the clinical feasibility and treatment outcomes of image-based high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy using an intracavitary multichannel vaginal cylinder for the definitive treatment of vaginal cancers. A total of 41 patients with vaginal cancer (24% primary vaginal and 76% recurrence from other gynecologic primaries) treated with definitive radiotherapy ± chemotherapy including image-based HDR brachytherapy with a multichannel vaginal cylinder were included in the study. Image-based brachytherapy was completed using either CT- (41%) or MR-based planning (59%) with each fraction. The high-risk clinical target volume was defined based on the pre- and postexternal beam radiotherapy gross tumor volume. Doses were converted to equivalent dose of 2Gy per fraction. Endpoints examined were dose-volume parameters and early clinical outcomes. The median high-risk clinical target volume was 24.2 cc (interquartile range [IQR], 12.6), with a median dose to 90% (D90) of 77.1 Gy (IQR, 3.4). The median dose to 2 cc (D(2 cc)) for the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid were 59.4 Gy (IQR, 5.6), 58.2 Gy (IQR, 4.1), and 52.3 Gy (IQR, 5.5), respectively. After a median followup of 16 months (range, 3-35), complete clinical response was documented in 98% of the patients. The 2-year local, regional, and distant control; and disease-free and overall survival were 93%, 100%, 81%, 78%, and 88%, respectively.

Recurrence patterns and survival endpoints in women with stage II uterine endometrioid carcinoma: a multi-institution study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-12-12,"There is paucity of data in regard to prognostic factors and outcome of women with 2009 FIGO stage II disease. The objective of this study was to investigate prognostic factors, recurrence patterns and survival endpoints in this group of patients. Data from four academic institutions were analyzed. 130 women were identified with 2009 FIGO stage II. All patients underwent hysterectomy, oophorectomy and lymph node evaluation with or without pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissections and peritoneal cytology. The Kaplan-Meier approach and Cox regression analysis were used to estimate recurrence-free (RFS), disease-specific (DSS) and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 44months. 120 patients (92%) underwent simple hysterectomy, 78% had lymph node dissection and 95% had peritoneal cytology examination. 99 patients (76%) received adjuvant radiation treatment (RT). 5-year RFS, DSS and OS were 77%, 90%, and 72%, respectively. On multivariate analysis of RFS, adjuvant RT, the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and high tumor grades were significant predictors. For DSS, LVSI and high tumor grades were significant predictors while older age and high tumor grade were the only predictors of OS. In this multi-institutional study, disease-specific survival for women with FIGO stage II uterine endometrioid carcinoma is excellent. High tumor grade, lymphovascular space invasion, adjuvant radiation treatment and old age are important prognostic factors.

Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy decreases the risk of vaginal recurrence in patients with stage I non-invasive uterine papillary serous carcinoma. A multi-institutional study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-01-07,"To investigate the impact of adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy on vaginal recurrence in stage I non-invasive uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). This is a retrospective multi-institutional study from 2000-2012. 103 patients who underwent surgical treatment with non-invasive stage IA UPSC were included. 85% and 55% underwent staging lymphadenectomy and omentectomy respectively. 28.2% (29/103) developed recurrence. Vaginal, pelvic and extra-pelvic recurrences developed in 7.8% (8/103), 3.9% (4/103) and 16.5% (17/103) respectively. Among patients who were observed or received only chemotherapy, the rate of vaginal recurrence was 10.9% (7/64) compared to 2.6% (1/39) among those who received vaginal brachytherapy +/- chemotherapy (p=0.035). The rate of vaginal recurrence was not different between those who were observed and those who received only chemotherapy (9.3% vs. 14.3%, p=0.27). The 5-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 88.3% and 90.6%. Patients who underwent surgical staging had longer PFS (p=0.001) and OS (p=0.0005) compared to those who did not. In multivariable analysis controlling for age, histology, chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and staging lymphadenectomy, only lymphadenectomy was an independent predictor of PFS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.71, p=0.0037) and OS (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.71, p=0.0035). Neither chemotherapy nor brachytherapy were predictors of PFS or OS. This is the largest study reported in stage I non-invasive UPSC. The majority of recurrences were extra-pelvic. Vaginal brachytherapy has a significant role in reducing the risk of vaginal recurrence and surgical staging was the only predictor of outcome.

Optimizing packing contrast for MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy planning for cervical cancer.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2015-01-22,"We prospectively tested five variations in vaginal gauze packing in an effort to improve contrast between the packing, cervix, and applicator for MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy planning. Five patients enrolled on a prospective study from May 2013 to October 2013 received MRI-based intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer with variations of impregnated gauze packing. Substances tested included antibiotic cream alone, antibiotic cream mixed with ultrasound gel, conjugated estrogens cream mixed with ultrasound gel, ultrasound gel alone, and gadolinium. Images from the T2-weighted pelvic MRI were used to obtain signal intensity measurements at points within the packing, cervix, and applicator. Signal intensity values were normalized using the signal-to-noise ratio and compared using an unpaired t-test. Ultrasound gel-impregnated gauze allowed for the greatest contrast between the packing and the cervix with a difference in mean normalized signal intensity of 38.2 (p < 0.01). Conjugated estrogens cream mixed with ultrasound gel and gadolinium also provided contrast when compared with cervix, with differences in mean normalized signal intensity of 25.3 and -16.2, respectively (p < 0.01 for both). For all variations but gadolinium, the normalized mean signal intensity of the packing was found to be significantly different from the applicator, with the ultrasound gel again demonstrating the greatest contrast with a difference of 42.5 (p < 0.01).

Cancer,2015-03-01,"The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of patients with stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and vaginal cuff brachytherapy. We retrospectively identified 83 patients treated for 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma at our institution between 2003 and 2010. All patients underwent comprehensive surgical staging. Adjuvant therapy was carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6 cycles and vaginal cuff brachytherapy. For analysis, patients were grouped into type I (FIGO grade 1-2 endometrioid histology, n = 41) or type II (FIGO grade 3, clear cell or papillary serous histology, n = 42) disease. Forty-three patients (52%) had node-positive disease, with similar node-positive rates for type I (n = 21, 51.2%) and type II (n = 22, 52.4%). The median follow-up was 38.6 months. There were no isolated vaginal failures. The estimated 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for type I versus type II were 92.4% versus 58.0% (P = 0.001) and 97.2% versus 65.8% (P = 0.002), respectively. The 3-year DFS and OS for node negative versus node positive were 85.0% versus 63.6% (P = 0.02) and 84.2% versus 78.0% (P = 0.02), respectively. Associations between type I histology and node-negative disease with improved DFS and OS persisted on multivariate analysis. Our institutional approach of adjuvant chemotherapy and vaginal cuff brachytherapy for stage III endometrial cancer seemed acceptable for patients with low-risk histology or node-negative disease. In contrast, higher rates of failure among those with high-risk histology and/or node-positive disease support intensification of therapy in these subsets.",Journal Article,1787.0,9.0,aim evaluate outcomes patients stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma treated surgery followed adjuvant chemotherapy vaginal cuff brachytherapy retrospectively identified 83 patients treated 1988 International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics FIGO stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma institution 2003 2010 patients underwent comprehensive surgical staging Adjuvant therapy carboplatin paclitaxel 6 cycles vaginal cuff brachytherapy patients grouped type FIGO grade 1-2 endometrioid histology n 41 type II FIGO grade 3 clear papillary serous histology n 42 disease Forty-three patients 52 node-positive disease similar node-positive rates type n 21 51.2 type II n 22 52.4 median follow-up 38.6 months isolated vaginal failures estimated 3-year disease-free survival DFS overall survival OS type versus type II 92.4 versus 58.0 P 0.001 97.2 versus 65.8 P 0.002 respectively 3-year DFS OS node negative versus node positive 85.0 versus 63.6 P 0.02 84.2 versus 78.0 P 0.02 respectively Associations type histology node-negative disease improved DFS OS persisted multivariate institutional approach adjuvant chemotherapy vaginal cuff brachytherapy stage III endometrial acceptable patients low-risk histology node-negative disease contrast higher rates failure high-risk histology and/or node-positive disease support intensification therapy subsets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 123, 1, 7, 5, 82, 316, 449, 73, 5, 152, 370, 20, 249, 56, 2, 11445, 1536, 21, 894, 108, 852, 7, 73, 9, 3314, 944, 7303, 1, 6429, 2, 7407, 3837, 82, 316, 449, 28, 114, 731, 59, 1522, 2, 1120, 62, 7, 208, 949, 221, 632, 249, 36, 10, 927, 2, 490, 9, 49, 410, 2, 11445, 1536, 9, 65, 7, 11, 3706, 237, 267, 70, 3837, 88, 14, 18, 3151, 784, 78, 605, 15, 267, 215, 3837, 88, 27, 885, 31, 15, 1796, 1744, 784, 78, 595, 34, 1213, 169, 7, 653, 42, 289, 109, 34, 5, 288, 289, 109, 151, 9, 267, 70, 78, 239, 725, 18, 2, 267, 215, 78, 350, 653, 39, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 519, 49, 53, 125, 11, 77, 1355, 3368, 3, 661, 27, 111, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 2, 63, 25, 118, 9, 267, 70, 185, 267, 215, 11, 937, 39, 185, 717, 13, 19, 13, 144, 2, 1015, 18, 185, 556, 66, 19, 13, 1111, 106, 3, 27, 111, 1010, 2, 118, 9, 289, 199, 185, 289, 109, 11, 772, 13, 185, 676, 49, 19, 13, 588, 2, 874, 18, 185, 833, 13, 19, 13, 588, 106, 685, 59, 267, 70, 784, 2, 289, 199, 34, 5, 231, 1010, 2, 118, 3760, 23, 331, 65, 114, 1115, 353, 1, 249, 56, 2, 11445, 1536, 9, 82, 316, 12, 5025, 1595, 9, 7, 5, 154, 43, 784, 15, 289, 199, 34, 4, 748, 142, 151, 1, 496, 107, 135, 5, 64, 43, 784, 2, 15, 289, 109, 34, 538, 5091, 1, 36, 4, 46, 1890]",1605.0,25621409,Adjuvant carboplatin paclitaxel vaginal cuff brachytherapy stage III endometrial outcomes patterns recurrence based pathologic characteristics,0,0.0
Impact of adjuvant chemotherapy and pelvic radiation on pattern of recurrence and outcome in stage I non-invasive uterine papillary serous carcinoma. A multi-institution study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-01-29,"To determine the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy or pelvic radiation on risk of recurrence and outcome in stage IA non-invasive uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). This is a multi-institutional retrospective study for 115 patients with stage IA non-invasive UPSC (confined to endometrium) treated between 2000 and 2012. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling were used. Staging lymphadenectomy and omentectomy were performed in 84% and 57% respectively. Recurrence was seen in 26% (30/115). Sites of recurrences were vaginal in 7.8% (9/115), pelvic in 3.5% (4/115) and extra-pelvic in 14.7% (17/115). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not impact risk of recurrence (25.5% vs. 26.9%, p=0.85) even in subset of patients who underwent lymphadenectomy (20% vs. 23.5%, p=0.80). These findings were consistent for pattern of recurrence. Among those who underwent lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy did not impact progression-free survival (p=0.34) and overall survival (p=0.12). However among patients who did not have lymphadenectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy or pelvic radiation was associated with longer progression-free survival (p=0.04) and overall survival (p=0.025). In multivariable analysis, only staging lymphadenectomy was associated with improved progression-free survival (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.95, p=0.04) and overall survival (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-1.0, p=0.05). Neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor pelvic radiation were predictors of progression-free or overall survivals. In stage IA non-invasive UPSC, staging lymphadenectomy was significantly associated with recurrence and outcome and therefore, should be performed in all patients.

Detection of endometrial cancer via molecular analysis of DNA collected with vaginal tampons.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-02-10,"We demonstrate the feasibility of detecting EC by combining minimally-invasive specimen collection techniques with sensitive molecular testing. Prior to hysterectomy for EC or benign indications, women collected vaginal pool samples with intravaginal tampons and underwent endometrial brushing. Specimens underwent pyrosequencing for DNA methylation of genes reported to be hypermethylated in gynecologic cancers and recently identified markers discovered by profiling over 200 ECs. Methylation was evaluated individually across CpGs and averaged across genes. Differences between EC and benign endometrium (BE) were assessed using two-sample t-tests and area under the curve (AUC). Thirty-eight ECs and 28 BEs were included. We evaluated 97 CpGs within 12 genes, including previously reported markers (RASSF1, HSP2A, HOXA9, CDH13, HAAO, and GTF2A1) and those identified in discovery work (ASCL2, HTR1B, NPY, HS3ST2, MME, ADCYAP1, and additional CDH13 CpG sites). Mean methylation was higher in tampon specimens from EC v. BE for 9 of 12 genes (ADCYAP1, ASCL2, CDH13, HS3ST2, HTR1B, MME, HAAO, HOXA9, and RASSF1) (all p<0.05). Among these genes, relative hypermethylation was observed in EC v. BE across CpGs. Endometrial brush and tampon results were similar. Within tampon specimens, AUC was highest for HTR1B (0.82), RASSF1 (0.75), and HOXA9 (0.74). This is the first report of HOXA9 hypermethylation in EC. DNA hypermethylation in EC tissues can also be identified in vaginal pool DNA collected via intravaginal tampon.

Vaginal brachytherapy for early-stage carcinosarcoma of the uterus.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2015-04-15,"Uterine carcinosarcoma (CS) is an aggressive malignancy and the optimal adjuvant treatment is not well-established. We report outcomes with vaginal brachytherapy (VB) for women with early-stage CS. A multi-institutional retrospective study of Stage I-II CS treated with hysterectomy, surgical staging, and adjuvant high-dose-rate VB without external-beam pelvic radiotherapy was performed. Rates of vaginal control, pelvic control, locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. 33 patients were identified. Prescribed VB dose was 21 Gy in three fractions (n = 15 [45%]) or 24 Gy in six fractions (n = 18 [55%]). Eighteen patients (55%) received chemotherapy. Median followup was 2.0 years. Twenty-seven patients (82%) underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy, 5 (15%) had nodal sampling, and 1 (3%) had no lymph node assessment. Relapse occurred in 11 patients (33%), all of whom had lymph node evaluation. Locoregional relapse was a component of failure in 6 patients (18%), of whom 3 (9%) failed in the pelvis alone. Three patients (9%) had simultaneous distant and locoregional relapse (two vaginal, one pelvic). Five additional patients (15%) had distant relapse. Six of the 11 patients (55%) with disease recurrence received chemotherapy. Two-year vaginal control and pelvic control were 94% and 87%. Two-year locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 81%, 66%, and 79%.

Patient-reported outcomes with adjuvant exemestane versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women with early breast cancer undergoing ovarian suppression (TEXT and SOFT): a combined analysis of two phase 3 randomised trials.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-06-16,"The combined efficacy analysis of the TEXT and SOFT trials showed a significant disease-free survival benefit with exemestane plus ovarian function suppression (OFS) compared with tamoxifen plus OFS. We present patient-reported outcomes from these trials. Between Nov 7, 2003, and April 7, 2011, 4717 premenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer were enrolled in TEXT or SOFT to receive unmasked adjuvant treatment with 5 years of exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral ovarian irradiation were used to achieve OFS. Chemotherapy use was optional. Randomisation with permuted blocks was done with the International Breast Cancer Study Group's internet-based system and was stratified by chemotherapy use and status of lymph nodes. Patients completed a quality of life (QoL) form comprising several global and symptom indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and then every year during years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two treatments were tested at 6 months, 24 months, and 60 months with mixed-models for repeated measures for each trial with and without chemotherapy and overall. The analysis was by intention to treat. At the time of analysis, the median follow-up was 5·7 years (IQR 3·7-6·9); treatment and follow-up of patients continue. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, as NCT00066703 (TEXT) and NCT00066690 (SOFT). Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more affected by hot flushes and sweats over 5 years than were those on exemestane plus OFS, although these symptoms improved. Patients on exemestane plus OFS reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and difficulties becoming aroused than did patients on tamoxifen plus OFS; these differences persisted over time. An increase in bone or joint pain was more pronounced, particularly in the short term, in patients on exemestane plus OFS than patients on tamoxifen plus OFS. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the 5 years. Overall, from a QoL perspective, there is no strong indication to favour either exemestane plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS. The distinct effects of the two treatments on the burden of endocrine symptoms need to be addressed with patients individually.

""The Role of Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer: An ASTRO Evidence-Based Guideline"" by Klopp et al, published in 2014 in Practical Radiation Oncology, was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline content and recommendations were further reviewed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Endorsement Panel. The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the ASTRO guideline are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the ASTRO guideline with several qualifying statements. Surveillance without adjuvant radiation therapy is a reasonable option for women without residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen and for women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and < 50% myometrial invasion, especially when no other high-risk features are present. For women with grade 1 or 2 cancer and ≥ 50% myometrial invasion or grade 3 cancer and < 50% myometrial invasion, vaginal brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence and is preferred. Patients with grade 3 cancer and ≥ 50% myometrial invasion or cervical stroma invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to prevent pelvic recurrence. For women with high-risk early-stage disease and advanced disease, the ASCO Endorsement Panel added qualifying statements to the ASTRO recommendations to provide stronger statements in favor of chemotherapy (with or without radiation therapy).",Journal Article,1660.0,45.0,provide guidance role adjuvant radiation therapy treatment endometrial `` Role Postoperative Radiation Therapy Endometrial ASTRO Evidence-Based Guideline '' Klopp published 2014 Practical Radiation Oncology reviewed developmental rigor methodologists American Society Radiation Oncology ASTRO guideline content recommendations reviewed American Society Clinical Oncology ASCO Endorsement Panel ASCO Endorsement Panel determined recommendations ASTRO guideline clear thorough based relevant scientific evidence ASCO endorsed ASTRO guideline qualifying statements Surveillance adjuvant radiation therapy reasonable option women residual disease hysterectomy specimen women grade 1 2 50 myometrial invasion especially high-risk features present women grade 1 2 ≥ 50 myometrial invasion grade 3 50 myometrial invasion vaginal brachytherapy effective pelvic radiation therapy preventing vaginal recurrence preferred Patients grade 3 ≥ 50 myometrial invasion cervical stroma invasion benefit pelvic radiation prevent pelvic recurrence women high-risk early-stage disease advanced disease ASCO Endorsement Panel added qualifying statements ASTRO recommendations provide stronger statements favor chemotherapy radiation therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 377, 2753, 23, 3, 200, 1, 249, 121, 36, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12, 3, 200, 1, 573, 121, 36, 9, 12, 35, 7709, 241, 90, 2009, 522, 20, 66420, 2022, 2171, 983, 4, 1409, 4, 3320, 121, 413, 10, 446, 9, 4566, 13117, 20, 19827, 3, 597, 1174, 9, 121, 413, 7709, 2009, 2457, 2, 883, 11, 195, 446, 20, 3, 597, 1174, 1, 38, 413, 2697, 11049, 993, 3, 2697, 11049, 993, 509, 17, 3, 883, 29, 3, 7709, 2009, 32, 885, 5506, 2, 90, 23, 3, 96, 867, 3138, 241, 2697, 6864, 3, 7709, 2009, 5, 392, 14646, 7072, 617, 187, 249, 121, 36, 16, 8, 3203, 1501, 9, 117, 187, 753, 34, 4, 3, 2622, 2360, 2, 9, 117, 5, 88, 14, 15, 18, 12, 2, 212, 7327, 578, 1093, 198, 77, 127, 64, 43, 404, 32, 364, 9, 117, 5, 88, 14, 15, 18, 12, 2, 749, 212, 7327, 578, 15, 88, 27, 12, 2, 212, 7327, 578, 1536, 16, 22, 323, 22, 1110, 121, 36, 28, 3017, 146, 2, 16, 2514, 7, 5, 88, 27, 12, 2, 749, 212, 7327, 578, 15, 2477, 578, 68, 247, 29, 1110, 121, 6, 1682, 1110, 146, 9, 117, 5, 64, 43, 191, 82, 34, 2, 131, 34, 3, 2697, 11049, 993, 1953, 14646, 7072, 6, 3, 7709, 883, 6, 377, 3355, 7072, 4, 4283, 1, 56, 5, 15, 187, 121, 36]",1554.0,26150442,Postoperative Radiation Therapy Endometrial American Society Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Endorsement American Society Radiation Oncology Evidence-Based Guideline,0,0.0
Survivors of gynecologic malignancies: impact of treatment on health and well-being.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2015-08-06,"While overall survival from gynecologic malignancies has greatly improved over the last three decades, required treatments can lead to multiple health issues for survivors. Our objective was to identify health concerns that gynecologic cancer survivors face. A systematic, stratified sample of women with gynecologic malignancies was surveyed for 18 health issues occurring before, during, or after treatment. The impact of clinical features and treatment modality on health issues was assessed through multivariate logistic regression models. Of 2,546 surveys mailed, 622 were not received by eligible subjects secondary to invalid address, incorrect diagnosis, or death. Thus, 1924 survivors potentially received surveys. Of the 1,029 surveys (53.5%) completed, median age was 59 years; diagnoses included 29% cervical, 26% endometrial, 26% ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube, 12.1% vulvar, and 5.4% vaginal cancers. The most frequently reported health issues included fatigue (60.6%), sleep disturbance (54.9%), urinary difficulties (50.9%), sexual dysfunction (48.4%), neurologic issues (45.4%), bowel complaints (42.0%), depression (41.3%), and memory problems (41.2%). These rankings were consistent with patients' self-reported rankings of ""highest impact"" personal issues.

Pros and cons of vaginal brachytherapy after external beam radiation therapy in endometrial cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-09-30,"A large number of studies have looked at the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of endometrial cancer. One particular radiation strategy in common practice is the use of adjuvant external beam (EB) radiotherapy followed by vaginal brachytherapy (VB). While the addition of VB to EB provides a theoretical benefit of a localized boost with higher focused dose to an area of potentially high recurrence risk, a randomized clinical trial to compare outcomes and toxicities of EB+VB vs. EB alone is lacking. The goal of this review is to present the current data for and against the use of this combined radiation modality and to provide some preliminary evidence regarding which patient populations may be most likely to benefit.

The Impact of Adjuvant Therapy on Survival and Recurrence Patterns in Women With Early-Stage Uterine Carcinosarcoma: A Multi-institutional Study.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2016-01-01,"The aim of the study was to characterize the impact of adjuvant therapy on survival in women with stage I/II uterine carcinosarcoma after primary surgery. We reviewed records of 118 consecutively treated women with 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I/II uterine carcinosarcoma who underwent hysterectomy between 1990 and 2014 at 4 academic institutions. Patients were categorized by adjuvant treatment group into observation, chemotherapy only, radiation only, and combined chemotherapy and radiation. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Median follow-up was 28 months (range, 1-244 months). Lymphadenectomy was performed in 94 patients (80%). Postoperative management included observation (n = 37 [31%]), chemotherapy alone (n = 19 [16%]), radiation therapy (RT) alone (n = 24 [20%]), and combined RT and chemotherapy (n = 38 [32%]). Radiation therapy modality included vaginal brachytherapy in 22 patients, pelvic external beam RT in 21 patients, and combination in 19 patients. In 58% of women, chemotherapy consisted of carboplatin/paclitaxel. Median overall survival for all women was 97 months. On univariate analysis, adjuvant treatment group was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.96; p = 0.02), freedom from vaginal recurrence (HR, 0.55; CI, 0.37-0.82]; p = 0.004), and freedom from any recurrence (HR, 0.70; CI, 0.54-0.92; p = 0.01). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated a significant benefit to chemoradiation over other adjuvant treatments. Adjuvant treatment group remained a significant covariate for all 3 end points on multivariate analysis as well. In addition, lymphadenectomy improved overall survival on multivariate analysis (HR, 0.24; CI, 0.09-0.61; p = 0.003). Of patients under observation only who had a recurrence, 8 (44%) of 18 had a recurrence in the vagina as the sole site of recurrence. By contrast, of women who received vaginal brachytherapy, significantly fewer had a recurrence in the vagina (1/42 [2.3%]; p < 0.003, log-rank test). In women with early-stage uterine carcinosarcoma, our data suggest superior survival end points with combined RT and chemotherapy. The frequency of vaginal recurrence suggests a role for incorporating vaginal brachytherapy in the adjuvant management of this disease.",Journal Article,1481.0,10.0,aim characterize impact adjuvant therapy survival women stage I/II uterine carcinosarcoma primary surgery reviewed records 118 consecutively treated women 2009 International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics stage I/II uterine carcinosarcoma underwent hysterectomy 1990 2014 4 academic institutions Patients categorized adjuvant treatment group observation chemotherapy radiation combined chemotherapy radiation Survival conducted Kaplan-Meier Cox proportional hazards models Median follow-up 28 months range 1-244 months Lymphadenectomy performed 94 patients 80 Postoperative management included observation n 37 31 chemotherapy n 19 16 radiation therapy RT n 24 20 combined RT chemotherapy n 38 32 Radiation therapy modality included vaginal brachytherapy 22 patients pelvic external beam RT 21 patients combination 19 patients 58 women chemotherapy consisted carboplatin/paclitaxel Median overall survival women 97 months univariate adjuvant treatment group associated improved overall survival hazard ratio HR 0.74 confidence interval CI 0.58-0.96 p 0.02 freedom vaginal recurrence HR 0.55 CI 0.37-0.82 p 0.004 freedom recurrence HR 0.70 CI 0.54-0.92 p 0.01 Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant benefit chemoradiation adjuvant treatments Adjuvant treatment group remained significant covariate 3 end points multivariate addition lymphadenectomy improved overall survival multivariate HR 0.24 CI 0.09-0.61 p 0.003 patients observation recurrence 8 44 18 recurrence vagina sole site recurrence contrast women received vaginal brachytherapy significantly fewer recurrence vagina 1/42 2.3 p 0.003 log-rank test women early-stage uterine carcinosarcoma suggest superior survival end points combined RT chemotherapy frequency vaginal recurrence suggests role incorporating vaginal brachytherapy adjuvant management disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 3, 45, 10, 6, 1507, 3, 345, 1, 249, 36, 23, 25, 4, 117, 5, 82, 70, 215, 5623, 50, 86, 152, 21, 446, 1064, 1, 4002, 7380, 73, 117, 5, 1238, 944, 7303, 1, 6429, 2, 7407, 82, 70, 215, 5623, 54, 208, 2622, 59, 2289, 2, 1409, 28, 39, 1916, 1764, 7, 11, 2320, 20, 249, 24, 87, 237, 1664, 56, 158, 121, 158, 2, 397, 56, 2, 121, 25, 318, 11, 426, 75, 876, 882, 2, 418, 831, 1017, 274, 52, 166, 126, 10, 339, 53, 184, 14, 6567, 53, 2048, 10, 173, 4, 960, 7, 493, 573, 284, 159, 1664, 78, 567, 456, 56, 279, 78, 326, 245, 121, 36, 240, 279, 78, 259, 179, 2, 397, 240, 2, 56, 78, 519, 531, 121, 36, 1396, 159, 1536, 4, 350, 7, 1110, 1455, 1345, 240, 4, 239, 7, 2, 150, 4, 326, 7, 4, 717, 1, 117, 56, 1695, 1, 927, 490, 52, 63, 25, 9, 62, 117, 10, 1015, 53, 23, 880, 65, 249, 24, 87, 10, 41, 5, 231, 63, 25, 360, 197, 168, 13, 794, 307, 268, 58, 13, 717, 13, 921, 19, 13, 588, 3060, 29, 146, 168, 13, 614, 58, 13, 567, 13, 878, 19, 13, 1520, 2, 3060, 29, 500, 146, 168, 13, 431, 58, 13, 667, 13, 937, 19, 13, 355, 8716, 2213, 264, 8, 93, 247, 6, 975, 252, 127, 249, 640, 249, 24, 87, 958, 8, 93, 6322, 9, 62, 27, 396, 862, 23, 331, 65, 22, 149, 4, 352, 2048, 231, 63, 25, 23, 331, 65, 168, 13, 259, 58, 13, 1730, 13, 713, 19, 13, 1421, 1, 7, 669, 1664, 158, 54, 42, 8, 146, 66, 584, 1, 203, 42, 8, 146, 4, 3, 7553, 22, 3, 4991, 606, 1, 146, 20, 748, 1, 117, 54, 103, 1536, 97, 1497, 42, 8, 146, 4, 3, 7553, 14, 595, 18, 27, 19, 13, 1421, 1066, 1026, 412, 4, 117, 5, 191, 82, 5623, 114, 74, 309, 1123, 25, 396, 862, 5, 397, 240, 2, 56, 3, 675, 1, 146, 844, 8, 200, 9, 2570, 1536, 4, 3, 249, 284, 1, 26, 34]",2196.0,26509850,Impact Adjuvant Therapy Survival Recurrence Patterns Women Early-Stage Uterine Carcinosarcoma Multi-institutional,2,0.010050251256281407
"Patient-reported outcomes with anastrozole versus tamoxifen for postmenopausal patients with ductal carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy plus radiotherapy (NSABP B-35): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial.","Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2015-12-11,"The NSABP B-35 trial compared 5 years of treatment with anastrozole versus tamoxifen for reducing subsequent occurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients with ductal carcinoma in situ. This report assesses the effect of these drugs on quality of life and symptoms. The study was done at 333 hospitals in North America. Postmenopausal women with hormone-positive ductal carcinoma in situ treated by lumpectomy with clear resection margins and whole breast irradiation were randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or anastrazole (1 mg/day) for 5 years, stratified by age (<60 years vs ≥60 years). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Patients completed questionnaires at baseline and every 6 months thereafter for 6 years. The primary outcomes were SF-12 physical and mental health component scale scores, and vasomotor symptoms (as per the BCPT symptom scale). Secondary outcomes were vaginal symptoms and sexual functioning. Exploratory outcomes were musculoskeletal pain, bladder symptoms, gynaecological symptoms, cognitive symptoms, weight problems, vitality, and depression. We did the analyses by intention to treat, including patients who completed questionnaires at baseline and at least once during follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00053898. Between Jan 6, 2003, and June 15, 2006, 3104 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 1193 were included in the quality-of-life substudy: 601 assigned to tamoxifen and 592 assigned to anastrozole. We detected no significant difference between treatment groups for: physical health scores (mean severity score 46·72 for tamoxifen vs 45·85 for anastrozole; p=0·20), mental health scores (52·38 vs 51·48; p=0·38), energy and fatigue (58·34 vs 57·54; p=0·86), or symptoms of depression (6·19 vs 6·39; p=0·46) over 5 years. Vasomotor symptoms (1·33 vs 1·17; p=0·011), difficulty with bladder control (0·96 vs 0·80; p=0·0002), and gynaecological symptoms (0·29 vs 0·18; p<0·0001) were significantly more severe in the tamoxifen group than in the anastrozole group. Musculoskeletal pain (1·50 vs 1·72; p=0·0006) and vaginal symptoms (0·76 vs 0·86; p=0·035) were significantly worse in the anastrozole group than in the tamoxifen group. Sexual functioning did not differ significantly between the two treatments (43·65 vs 45·29; p=0·56). Younger age was significantly associated with more severe vasomotor symptoms (mean severity score 1·45 for age <60 years vs 0·65 for age ≥60 years; p=0·0006), vaginal symptoms (0·98 vs 0·65; p<0·0001), weight problems (1·32 vs 1·02; p<0·0001), and gynaecological symptoms (0·26 vs 0·22; p=0·014). Given the similar efficacy of tamoxifen and anastrozole for women older than age 60 years, decisions about treatment should be informed by the risk for serious adverse health effects and the symptoms associated with each drug. For women younger than 60 years old, treatment decisions might be driven by efficacy (favouring anastrozole); however, if the side-effects of anastrozole are intolerable, then switching to tamoxifen is a good alternative.

Dying well: How equal is end of life care among gynecologic oncology patients?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-12-17,"To identify disparities in utilization of end of life (EoL) resources by gynecologic oncology (GO) patients. This retrospective analysis of the medical records of GO patients treated 1/2007-12/2011 and deceased 1/2012-8/2014 evaluated patient demographics, disease characteristics, and utilization of EoL resources. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. Of 189 patients analyzed, 113 (60%) were white, 38 (20%) Hispanic, 31 (16%) black, and seven (4%) Asian. Ninety-five (48%) had ovarian cancer, 51 (26%) uterine, 47 (23%) cervical, seven (3%) vulvar/vaginal. In the last 30days of life (DoL), 18 (10%) had multiple hospital admissions, 10 (5%) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 30 (16%) multiple Emergency Room (ER) visits, 45 (24%) received aggressive medical care and eight (4%) received chemotherapy in the final 14 DoL. Furthermore, 54 (29%) had no Supportive Care referral and 29 (15%) no hospice referral. Only 46 (24%) had a Medical Power of Attorney (PoA) or Living Will (LW) on file. Non-white race was associated with increased odds of dying without hospice (OR 3.07; 95%CI [1.27, 2.46], p=0.013). However, non-white patients who enrolled in hospice did so earlier than white patients (42 v. 27days before death, p=0.054). Non-white patients were also significantly less likely to have PoA/LW documentation (24% v. 76%, p=0.009) even if enrolled in hospice (12% v. 31%, p=0.007).

Impact of Robotic Platforms on Surgical Approach and Costs in the Management of Morbidly Obese Patients with Newly Diagnosed Uterine Cancer.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-01-07,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is associated with decreased complication rates, length of hospital stay, and cost compared with laparotomy. Robotic-assisted surgery-a method of laparoscopy-addresses many of the limitations of standard laparoscopic instrumentation, thus leading to increased rates of MIS. We sought to assess the impact of robotics on the rates and costs of surgical approaches in morbidly obese patients with uterine cancer. Patients who underwent primary surgery at our institution for uterine cancer from 1993 to 2012 with a BMI ≥40 mg/m(2) were identified. Surgical approaches were categorized as laparotomy (planned or converted), laparoscopic, robotic, or vaginal. We identified two time periods based on the evolving use of MIS at our institution: laparoscopic (1993-2007) and robotic (2008-2012). Direct costs were analyzed for cases performed from 2009 to 2012. We identified 426 eligible cases; 299 performed via laparotomy, 125 via MIS, and 2 via a vaginal approach. The rates of MIS for the laparoscopic and robotic time periods were 6 % and 57 %, respectively. The rate of MIS was 78 % in this morbidly obese cohort in 2012; 69 % were completed robotically. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (range 2-37) for laparotomy cases and 1 day (range 0-7) for MIS cases (P < 0.001). The complication rate was 36 and 15 %, respectively (P < 0.001). The rate of wound-related complications was 27 and 6 %, respectively (P < 0.001). Laparotomy was associated with the highest cost.

Surgical Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Extrafascial Hysterectomy After Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy With or Without Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Endometrial Cancer Clinically Extending to the Cervix or Parametria.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2017-07-01,"Recent data have shown high rates of clinical and pathologic responses to neoadjuvant radiation therapy for locally advanced endometrial cancer. There are limited data on the surgical outcomes of these patients in the era of modern radiation and surgical techniques. We sought to characterize surgical outcomes after extrafascial hysterectomy in this population. Patients with endometrial cancer of all histologies clinically involving the cervix or parametria treated with neoadjuvant brachytherapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy from 1999 to 2014 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for data regarding treatment characteristics and postoperative outcomes. Pearson χ and logistic regression analyses were used to assess correlations between surgical complications and treatment-related variables. Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Mean operating time for the cohort was 115 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 100 mL. No visceral injuries occurred. Mean length of hospital stay was 1 and 4 days for the minimally invasive and laparotomy groups, respectively. Rates of postoperative ileus, blood transfusion, wound infection, and readmission were 3%, 3%, 6%, and 3%, respectively. No case of prolonged urodynamic dysfunction was noted.

Stage I and II Endometrial Adenocarcinoma: Analysis of 2009 FIGO Staging Revision and Impact on Survival by Adjuvant Therapy.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-03-01,"In 2009, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics revised the staging classification for endometrial cancer. Mucosal cervical involvement was eliminated from the criteria and only those with stromal cervical involvement were considered stage II. We examined the implications of the staging changes and the survival impact of adjuvant therapy in stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma. Data were obtained from the National Oncology Data Alliance. Stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2008 were identified and grouped according to the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was performed using proportional hazards model; comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves was based on the log-rank statistic. A total of 14,158 patients with stage I to II endometrial adenocarcinoma were identified with a median follow-up of 41 months. Adjuvant external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VB) were positive predictors for overall survival (OS) only in IC, IIA, and IIB. On MVA, stages IA and IB OS did not differ (P=0.17), IIA had worse OS compared with IC (P<0.05), and IIA OS did not differ from IIB (P=0.57). Neither IA nor IB benefited from adjuvant radiotherapy on MVA. However, both IC and IIA had OS improvements with VB±EBRT (P<0.05) with the greatest impact from the VB. Mucosal cervical involvement represents a risk factor and should be considered when determining adjuvant therapy.

We present the patient-reported outcomes. The quality-of-life (QoL) analysis includes 1,722 of 2,045 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to receive adjuvant treatment with 5 years of tamoxifen plus OFS or tamoxifen alone. Chemotherapy use before enrollment was optional. Patients completed a QoL form consisting of global and symptom indicators at baseline, every 6 months for 24 months, and annually during years 3 to 6. Differences in the change of QoL from baseline between the two treatments were tested at 6, 24, and 60 months with mixed models for repeated measures with and without chemotherapy and overall. Patients on tamoxifen plus OFS were more affected than patients on tamoxifen alone by hot flushes at 6 and 24 months, by loss of sexual interest and sleep disturbance at 6 months, and by vaginal dryness up to 60 months. Without prior chemotherapy, patients on tamoxifen alone reported more vaginal discharge over the 5 years than patients on tamoxifen plus OFS. Symptom-specific treatment differences at 6 months were less pronounced in patients with prior chemotherapy. Changes in global QoL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the whole treatment period. Overall, OFS added to tamoxifen resulted in worse endocrine symptoms and sexual functioning during the first 2 years of treatment, with variable magnitudes of treatment differences.

High rates of early detection are attributed to warning symptoms; however, the prevalence of such symptoms has not been well defined. A case-control study was conducted assessing the prevalence of symptoms in EC patients at a large cancer center compared with healthy controls. Controls included patients seen for an annual gynecologic care visit (AV) or for a gynecological problem-based visit (PV). A self-administered questionnaire was given to all participants addressing EC-associated symptoms, at the time of initial clinic visit. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare prevalence of symptoms between EC cases and controls. Logistic regression was used to determine the impact of menopausal status and obesity on symptom prevalence. The cases (n = 75) were significantly older than the AV (n = 203) and PV (n = 151) controls (59.7 vs. 49.8 vs. 51.0 years, p < 0.01), had a higher body mass index (35.5 vs. 29.4 vs. 30.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p < 0.01), and were more likely to be postmenopausal (76% vs. 53.7% vs. 52.0%, p < 0.01).

American Brachytherapy Task Group Report: Adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy for early-stage endometrial cancer: A comprehensive review.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2016-05-31,"This article aims to review the risk stratification of endometrial cancer, treatment rationale, outcomes, treatment planning, and treatment recommendations of vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) in the postoperative management of endometrial cancer patients. The authors performed a thorough review of the literature and reference pertinent articles pertaining to the aims of this review. Adjuvant VBT for early-stage endometrial cancer patients results in very low rates of vaginal recurrence (0-3.1%) with low rates of late toxicity which are primarily vaginal in nature. Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Cancer 2 (PORTEC-2) supports that VBT results in noninferior rates of vaginal recurrence compared to external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of high-intermediate risk patients. VBT as a boost after external beam radiotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, and for high-risk histologies have shown excellent results as well though randomized data do not exist supporting VBT boost. There are many different applicators, dose-fractionation schedules, and treatment planning techniques which all result in favorable clinical outcomes and low rates of toxicity. Recommendations have been published by the American Brachytherapy Society and the American Society of Radiation Oncology to help guide practitioners in the use of VBT. Data support that patients and physicians prefer joint decision making regarding the use of VBT, and patients often desire additional treatment for a marginal benefit in risk of recurrence.

Perioperative Outcomes for Laparotomy Compared to Robotic Surgical Staging of Endometrial Cancer in the Elderly: A Retrospective Cohort.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2016-11-01,"This study aimed to compare outcomes of endometrial cancer (EMCA) staging in elderly patients performed either robotically or via laparotomy. A retrospective, multi-institutional chart review was conducted of all robotic and laparotomy staging surgeries for EMCA between 2003 and 2009. Charts were reviewed for intraoperative and postoperative complications and morbidities. Seven hundred forty-six women were identified who had undergone EMCA staging either robotically or via laparotomy; 89 and 93 patients 70 years or older underwent staging for EMCA via robotic and laparotomy, respectively. Both groups had similar age and body mass index. Among elderly patients being staged robotically, a higher incidence of pelvic lymphadenectomy, and decreased blood loss, incidence of blood transfusion, and overall complications were seen compared to laparotomy. Postoperatively, elderly patients staged robotically had a shorter median hospital stay (1 vs 4 days, P < 0.001), with no increase in readmission or return to the operating theater. No vessel, bowel, or genitourinary injuries occurred. Vaginal cuff dehiscence after robotic surgery was not significantly different, but wound and fascial complications were significantly increased in patients undergoing laparotomy. Thromboembolism rates were similar between both groups. Elderly patients can safely undergo robotic EMCA staging with improved outcomes compared to laparotomy. The benefits of robotic staging include higher incidence of completion of lymphadenectomy, decreased hospital stay (without an increase in readmissions or reoperations), decreased transfusions, and decreased wound and fascial complications.",Comparative Study,1176.0,8.0,aimed compare outcomes endometrial EMCA staging elderly patients performed robotically laparotomy retrospective multi-institutional chart review conducted robotic laparotomy staging surgeries EMCA 2003 2009 Charts reviewed intraoperative postoperative complications morbidities Seven forty-six women identified undergone EMCA staging robotically laparotomy 89 93 patients 70 years older underwent staging EMCA robotic laparotomy respectively groups similar age body mass index elderly patients staged robotically higher incidence pelvic lymphadenectomy decreased blood loss incidence blood transfusion overall complications seen compared laparotomy Postoperatively elderly patients staged robotically shorter median hospital stay 1 vs 4 days P 0.001 increase readmission return operating theater vessel bowel genitourinary injuries occurred Vaginal cuff dehiscence robotic surgery significantly different wound fascial complications significantly increased patients undergoing laparotomy Thromboembolism rates similar groups Elderly patients safely undergo robotic EMCA staging improved outcomes compared laparotomy benefits robotic staging include higher incidence completion lymphadenectomy decreased hospital stay increase readmissions reoperations decreased transfusions decreased wound fascial complications,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 1295, 6, 932, 123, 1, 12, 32645, 632, 4, 1216, 7, 173, 361, 15573, 15, 847, 3274, 8, 459, 1414, 1115, 2937, 206, 10, 426, 1, 62, 2895, 2, 3274, 632, 5305, 9, 32645, 59, 1522, 2, 1238, 4413, 11, 446, 9, 1720, 2, 573, 521, 2, 5655, 648, 1128, 1213, 437, 117, 11, 108, 54, 42, 1989, 32645, 632, 361, 15573, 15, 847, 3274, 887, 2, 966, 7, 431, 60, 15, 434, 208, 632, 9, 32645, 847, 2895, 2, 3274, 106, 110, 271, 42, 288, 89, 2, 642, 782, 558, 107, 1216, 7, 486, 2930, 15573, 8, 142, 287, 1, 1110, 2048, 2, 340, 315, 407, 287, 1, 315, 2785, 2, 63, 521, 11, 527, 72, 6, 3274, 3541, 1216, 7, 2930, 15573, 42, 8, 985, 52, 702, 2020, 14, 105, 39, 162, 19, 13, 144, 5, 77, 344, 4, 3146, 15, 4656, 6, 3, 2584, 68895, 77, 3685, 1659, 15, 4109, 13063, 489, 11445, 11811, 50, 2895, 152, 10, 44, 97, 338, 84, 2689, 2, 15027, 521, 11, 97, 101, 4, 7, 479, 3274, 3501, 151, 11, 288, 59, 110, 271, 1216, 7, 122, 2268, 1251, 2895, 32645, 632, 5, 231, 123, 72, 6, 3274, 3, 1141, 1, 2895, 632, 643, 142, 287, 1, 1438, 1, 2048, 340, 702, 2020, 187, 35, 344, 4, 5319, 15, 10691, 340, 4987, 2, 340, 2689, 2, 15027, 521]",1617.0,27575633,Perioperative Outcomes Laparotomy Compared Robotic Surgical Staging Endometrial Elderly Retrospective Cohort,0,0.0
Extended mortality results for ovarian cancer screening in the PLCO trial with median 15years follow-up.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-09-09,"The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial originally reported no mortality benefit of ovarian cancer screening after a median of 12.4years of follow-up. The UKCTOCS screening trial failed to show a statistically significant mortality reduction in the primary analysis but reported an apparent increased mortality benefit in trial years 7-14 compared to 0-7. Here we report an updated analysis of PLCO with extended mortality follow-up. Participants were randomized from 1993 to 2001 at ten U.S. centers to an intervention or usual care arm. Intervention arm women were screened for ovarian cancer with annual trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVU) (4years) and CA-125 (6years), with a fixed cutoff at 35U/mL for CA-125. The original follow-up period was for up to 13years (median follow-up 12.4years); in this analysis follow-up for mortality was extended by up to 6years. 39,105 (intervention) and 39,111 (usual care) women were randomized, of which 34,253 and 34,304, respectively, had at least one ovary at baseline. Median follow-up was 14.7years in each arm and maximum follow-up 19.2years in each arm. A total of 187 (intervention) and 176 (usual care) deaths from ovarian cancer were observed, for a risk-ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87-1.30). Risk-ratios were similar for study years 0-7 (RR=1.04), 7-14 (RR=1.06) and 14+ (RR=1.09). The risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97-1.05).

Menopausal hormone therapy in cancer survivors: A narrative review of the literature.,Maturitas,Maturitas,2016-07-27,"Decision making regarding the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for the treatment of bothersome menopausal symptoms in a cancer survivor can be complex, and includes assessment of its impact on disease-free or overall survival. Estrogen receptors are present in several cancer types, but this does not always result in estrogen-mediated tumor proliferation and adverse cancer-related outcomes. Estrogen may even be protective against certain cancers. Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after diagnosis of some cancer types, but not others. We provide a narrative review of the medical literature regarding the risk of cancer recurrence and associated mortality with initiation of MHT after the diagnosis of breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, hematologic cancers, and melanoma. Menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for management of bothersome menopausal symptoms in women with some cancer types (e.g., colorectal and hematologic cancer, localized melanoma, and most cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers), while nonhormonal treatment options may be preferred for others (e.g., breast cancer). In women with other cancer types, recommendations are less straightforward, and the use of MHT must be individualized.

One week later, an inappropriate β-hCG level rise to 10,937 milli-international units/mL was noted, prompting a second dose of methotrexate and computed tomography imaging, leading to the discovery of gastric and liver lesions. Pathology from gastric biopsies revealed nongestational choriocarcinoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, with death from cardiac arrest 7 months after diagnosis. Malignancies that can secrete β-hCG include gestational trophoblastic disease, gonadal and extragonadal germ cell tumors, and malignancies with choriocarcinoma differentiation. Although ectopic pregnancy compromises approximately 2% of first-trimester pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and gestational choriocarcinoma can be seen in 1 of 1,500 and 1 of 20,000 pregnancies, respectively.

Reduction of cyclophosphamide dose for patients with subset 2 low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma is associated with an increased risk of recurrence: A report from the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-02-17,"Failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were found to improve on Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) IV (IRS-IV) compared with IRS-III for patients with subset 2 (IRS stage 1, group III nonorbit or stage 3, group I/II) low-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma with the addition of cyclophosphamide (total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 26.4 g/m<sup>2</sup> ) to the combination of vincristine and dactinomycin (VAC). The goal of Children's Oncology Group ARST0331 for subset 2 low-risk patients was to reduce the total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose without compromising FFS. Therapy included 4 cycles of VAC (total cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 4.8 g/m<sup>2</sup> ) followed by 12 cycles of vincristine and dactinomycin over 46 weeks. Patients with group II or III tumors received radiotherapy, except for girls with group III vaginal tumors who enrolled before September 2009 and achieved a complete response with chemotherapy with or without delayed surgical resection. Among 66 eligible patients who were followed for a median of 3.5 years, there were 20 failures versus 10.53 expected failures. The estimated 3-year FFS and OS rates were 70% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 57%-80%) and 92% (95% CI, 83%-97%), respectively. The estimated 3-year FFS rate was 57% (95% CI, 33%-75%) for girls with subset 2 genital tract embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (21 patients) and 77% (95% CI, 61%-87%) for all other subset 2 patients (45 patients) (P = .02). The authors observed suboptimal FFS among patients with subset 2 low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma using reduced total cyclophosphamide. Eliminating radiotherapy for girls with group III vaginal tumors in combination with reduced total cyclophosphamide appeared to contribute to the suboptimal outcome.

A pilot randomized trial to prevent sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors starting adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2017-02-22,"A randomized pilot trial evaluated the hypothesis that early intervention lessens sexual dysfunction in the first year on aromatase inhibitors. A secondary aim was comparing the efficacy of two vaginal moisturizers. Fifty-seven postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer starting aromatase inhibitors were randomized to three treatment groups. All received a handout on managing sexual and other side effects. The Usual Care group received no additional therapy. The Active Treatment groups received a 6-month supply of a vaginal moisturizer (hyaluronic acid-based in Active Group-H and prebiotic in Active Group-P) and a vaginal lubricant and dilator, plus access to an educational website and phone coaching. Questionnaires completed at baseline, 6, and 12 months included the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Menopausal Sexual Interest Questionnaire (MSIQ), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R), and a menopausal symptom scale. Forty-nine women (86%) provided follow-up data. Mean age was 59 and 77% were non-Hispanic Caucasian. Sexual function was impaired at baseline, but remained stable over 12 months for all groups. The combined active treatment group had less dyspareunia (P = 0.07) and sexual distress (P = 0.02) at 6 months than the Usual Care group. At 6 months, the Active-H group improved significantly more than the Active-P group on FSFI total score (P = 0.04).

Impact of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on Management of Early Stage Clear Cell and Papillary Serous Carcinoma of the Uterus.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2017-05-01,"The aim of the study was to assess interaction of lymph node dissection (LND), adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), and radiotherapy (RT) in stage I uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) and uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCC). The National Cancer Data Base was queried for women diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I UPSC and UCC from 1998 to 2012. Overall survival (OS) was estimated for combinations of RT and CT by the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by histology and LND. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were generated. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma: 5432 women with UPSC were identified. Uterine papillary serous carcinoma had the highest 5-year OS with CT + RT with (83%) or without LND (76%). On multivariate analyses, CT [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; P = 0.01] and vaginal cuff brachytherapy (HR, 0.68; P = 0.003) with LND were independently associated with OS. Without LND, vaginal cuff brachytherapy (HR, 0.53; P = 0.03), but not CT (HR, 1.21; P = 0.92), was associated with OS. Uterine clear cell carcinoma: 2516 women with UCC were identified.

Urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor disorders after radiation therapy in endometrial cancer survivors.,Maturitas,Maturitas,2017-03-18,"To investigate radiation therapy as a risk factor for urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and sexual dysfunction in endometrial cancer survivors. We performed a retrospective cohort study of endometrial cancer survivors. Data were collected using a mailed survey and the medical record. Validated questionnaires were used to generate rates of urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor disorders. The incidence rates of pelvic floor disorders were compared across groups with different exposures to radiation. Of the 149 endometrial cancer survivors, 41% received radiation therapy. Fifty-one percent of women reported urine leakage. The rates of urinary incontinence in women exposed and not exposed to vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) or whole-pelvis radiation were 48% and 58%, respectively (p=0.47). The incidence of fecal incontinence did not differ between groups, but the score for overall sexual function was significantly higher in women who did not undergo radiation therapy. On multivariable analysis, significant risk factors for urinary incontinence were age (AOR 1.06 95% CI 1.02, 1.10) and BMI (AOR 1.07 95% CI 1.02, 1.11), but treatment with radiation was not significantly associated with urinary incontinence, or fecal incontinence (p>0.05).

Missing documentation in breast cancer survivors: genitourinary syndrome of menopause.,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",Menopause,2017-12-01,"Breast cancer survivors often take hormonal treatments to prevent the recurrence of breast cancer, particularly aromatase inhibitors that can worsen the symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) such as dyspareunia, dysuria, and urinary incontinence, all of which may adversely affect survivors' quality of life. Few breast cancer survivors experiencing GSM receive adequate assessment or treatment. In this descriptive study, we reviewed medical records for documented GSM and any treatments administered or referrals for treatment in 800 female patients who visited the Breast Cancer Survivorship Clinic at a comprehensive cancer center between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, either at least 5 years after completion of treatment for invasive breast cancer or at least 6 months after completion of treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ. Of the 279 patients with documented symptoms of vaginal atrophy, only 111 (39.8%) had documentation of having received any form of treatment or referral. Of the 71 patients with documented symptoms of urinary tract atrophy, only 33.8% had documentation of having received treatment or referral for treatment. Breast cancer survivors often experience GSM due to lack of estrogen. The worrisome lack of documentation of assessment or treatment for GSM in a large breast cancer survivorship practice reveals missed opportunities to improve quality of life.

Demographic and clinical information was abstracted on chart review. The primary outcome was ORT risk level (low vs. moderate or high). Chi-square tests were performed for categorical variables. A total of 118 women were screened. Most women were Caucasian (79%) with a median age of 57years. Ovarian cancer patients comprised 46% of the cohort with fewer endometrial (25%), cervical (23%), vulvar (4%), and vaginal (2%) cancer patients. The median ORT score was 1.0 (range, 0-10) out of a possible 26. Overall, 87% of patients were categorized as low-risk for opioid misuse, 7% as moderate-risk, and 6% as high-risk. Patients who were at moderate or high-risk of opioid misuse were significantly younger (47 vs. 58years, p=0.02), more likely to have cervical cancer (p=0.02), be smokers (p=0.01) and be uninsured or on Medicare (p=0.03).

American Brachytherapy Society recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium task force patterns of care and review of the literature.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2017-09-06,"The purpose of this American Brachytherapy Society task force is to present a literature review and patterns of care by a panel of experts for the management of vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer. In 2016, the American Brachytherapy Society Board selected a panel of experts in gynecologic brachytherapy to update our current state of knowledge for managing vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer. Practice patterns were evaluated via an online survey and clinical updates occurred through a combination of literature review and clinical experience and/or expertise. There are various retrospective series of patients treated with radiation for vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer, which include a varied group of patients, multiple treatment techniques, and a range of total doses and demonstrate a wide scope of local control and overall survival outcomes. In the era of image-guided brachytherapy, high local control rates with low significant late-term morbidities can be achieved. Lower rates of local control and higher late-term toxicity are reported in the retreatment setting. In patients with no previous history of radiation treatment, external beam radiation therapy followed by brachytherapy boost should be used.

Role of Radiation Therapy in the Multidisciplinary Management of Uterine Carcinosarcoma.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2018-01-01,"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of radiation therapy on outcomes for patients with uterine carcinosarcoma (UC). We retrospectively reviewed the records of 155 women with stage I (98), II (11), or III (46) UC who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at our institution between 1990 and 2011. Survival rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Seventy-six patients (49%) received radiation therapy: 38 (50%) had vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VBT) alone and 38 had external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) ± VBT. Seventy patients (45%) received chemotherapy (12 concurrent, 49 adjuvant, 9 both). The 5-year overall survival rate was 48.6% (stage I, 53.8%; II, 30.0%; and III, 42.5%). The disease-specific survival (DSS) rate was 57.2% (stage I, 60.9%; II, 44.4%; and III, 51.8%). Patients treated with EBRT had a higher 5-year pelvic disease control rate (88.3%) than did patients treated with VBT only (67.4%) or no radiation (71.2%; P = 0.04). In stage III patients, EBRT was associated with higher 5-year pelvic disease control (90.0% vs 55.5%, P = 0.046), DSS (64.6% vs 46.4%, P = 0.13), and overall survival (64.6% vs 34.0%, P = 0.04) rates. For all 155 patients, age at least 65 years, cervical involvement, and lymph vascular space invasion were correlated with lower DSS on univariate and multivariate analyses. In addition, treatment with concurrent chemoradiation therapy was independently associated with a higher DSS rate on multivariate analysis. Patients with UC have a high rate of relapse in the regional nodes and distant sites. External beam radiation therapy improves locoregional control in all stages and may improve survival in stage III patients who are at the highest risk of pelvic relapse.",Journal Article,750.0,2.0,aimed evaluate impact radiation therapy outcomes patients uterine carcinosarcoma UC retrospectively reviewed records 155 women stage 98 II 11 III 46 UC underwent total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy institution 1990 2011 Survival rates assessed Kaplan-Meier log-rank test Univariate multivariate Cox regression performed Seventy-six patients 49 received radiation therapy 38 50 vaginal cuff brachytherapy VBT 38 external beam radiation therapy EBRT ± VBT Seventy patients 45 received chemotherapy 12 concurrent 49 adjuvant 9 5-year overall survival rate 48.6 stage 53.8 II 30.0 III 42.5 disease-specific survival DSS rate 57.2 stage 60.9 II 44.4 III 51.8 Patients treated EBRT higher 5-year pelvic disease control rate 88.3 patients treated VBT 67.4 radiation 71.2 P 0.04 stage III patients EBRT associated higher 5-year pelvic disease control 90.0 vs 55.5 P 0.046 DSS 64.6 vs 46.4 P 0.13 overall survival 64.6 vs 34.0 P 0.04 rates 155 patients age 65 years cervical involvement lymph vascular space invasion correlated lower DSS univariate multivariate addition treatment concurrent chemoradiation therapy independently associated higher DSS rate multivariate Patients UC high rate relapse regional nodes distant sites External beam radiation therapy improves locoregional control stages improve survival stage III patients highest risk pelvic relapse,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 1295, 6, 376, 3, 345, 1, 121, 36, 23, 123, 9, 7, 5, 5623, 2417, 21, 894, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 3735, 117, 5, 82, 70, 1096, 215, 175, 15, 316, 641, 2417, 54, 208, 181, 1467, 2622, 1607, 5690, 3470, 28, 114, 731, 59, 2289, 2, 1132, 25, 151, 11, 275, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 1066, 1026, 412, 880, 2, 331, 418, 320, 318, 11, 173, 2073, 437, 7, 739, 103, 121, 36, 519, 212, 42, 11445, 1536, 15050, 279, 2, 519, 42, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 1883, 810, 15050, 2073, 7, 512, 103, 56, 133, 750, 739, 249, 83, 110, 3, 33, 111, 63, 25, 116, 10, 576, 49, 82, 70, 699, 66, 215, 201, 13, 2, 316, 595, 33, 3, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 116, 10, 696, 18, 82, 70, 335, 83, 215, 584, 39, 2, 316, 725, 66, 7, 73, 5, 1883, 42, 8, 142, 33, 111, 1110, 34, 182, 116, 889, 27, 76, 205, 7, 73, 5, 15050, 158, 598, 39, 15, 77, 121, 792, 18, 19, 13, 755, 4, 82, 316, 7, 1883, 10, 41, 5, 142, 33, 111, 1110, 34, 182, 424, 13, 105, 614, 33, 19, 13, 4902, 1788, 660, 49, 105, 641, 39, 19, 13, 233, 2, 63, 25, 660, 49, 105, 562, 13, 19, 13, 755, 151, 9, 62, 3735, 7, 89, 28, 506, 556, 60, 799, 2, 263, 756, 3865, 578, 11, 438, 5, 280, 1788, 23, 880, 2, 331, 318, 4, 352, 24, 5, 750, 975, 36, 10, 1042, 41, 5, 8, 142, 1788, 116, 23, 331, 65, 7, 5, 2417, 47, 8, 64, 116, 1, 429, 4, 3, 951, 502, 2, 626, 633, 1455, 1345, 121, 36, 1804, 1325, 182, 4, 62, 1153, 2, 68, 401, 25, 4, 82, 316, 7, 54, 32, 28, 3, 1076, 43, 1, 1110, 429]",1714.0,28930812,Role Radiation Therapy Multidisciplinary Management Uterine Carcinosarcoma,49,0.24623115577889448
Life after endometrial cancer: A systematic review of patient-reported outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-11-14,"Women with endometrial cancer (EC) are the second largest population of female cancer survivors in the United States. However, the outcomes of EC survivors, from the patient perspective, are not well-understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following an EC diagnosis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and reference lists to identify published observational studies that examined PROs among women with EC. Reviewers independently reviewed eligible full-text study articles and conducted data extraction. We qualitatively summarized included articles according to exposures [e.g. body mass index (BMI), treatment, etc.] or specific PROs (e.g. sexual function). Of 1722 unique studies, 102 full-text articles were reviewed, of which a total of 27 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The most commonly used PRO questionnaires were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) (n=9), Short Form 36 Questionnaire (SF-36, n=8), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G, n=5), and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI, n=4). Obesity was associated with lower quality of life (QOL) and physical functioning. Treatment type affected several outcomes. Laparoscopy generally resulted in better QOL outcomes than laparotomy. Likewise, vaginal brachytherapy was associated with better outcomes compared to external beam radiation. Sexual function outcomes were dependent on age, time since diagnosis, and having consulted a physician before engaging in sexual activities. In addition, a physical activity intervention was associated with improved sexual interest but not sexual function. Our review provides insight into the experience of EC survivors from the patient perspective. Factors that contribute to QOL, such as pain, fatigue, emotional and social functioning, should be monitored following an EC diagnosis.",Journal Article,798.0,9.0,Women endometrial EC second largest population female survivors United States outcomes EC survivors patient perspective well-understood conducted systematic review patient-reported outcomes PROs following EC diagnosis searched MEDLINE EMBASE Scopus CINAHL reference lists identify published observational studies examined PROs women EC Reviewers independently reviewed eligible full-text articles conducted extraction qualitatively summarized included articles according exposures e.g body mass index BMI treatment specific PROs e.g sexual function 1722 unique studies 102 full-text articles reviewed total 27 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria commonly PRO questionnaires European Organization Research Treatment Quality Life Questionnaire-Core 30 EORTC QLQ-C30 n=9 Short Form 36 Questionnaire SF-36 n=8 Functional Assessment Therapy-General FACT-G n=5 Female Sexual Function Index FSFI n=4 Obesity associated lower quality life QOL physical functioning Treatment type affected outcomes Laparoscopy generally resulted better QOL outcomes laparotomy Likewise vaginal brachytherapy associated better outcomes compared external beam radiation Sexual function outcomes dependent age time diagnosis consulted physician engaging sexual activities addition physical activity intervention associated improved sexual sexual function review provides insight experience EC survivors patient perspective Factors contribute QOL pain fatigue emotional social functioning monitored following EC diagnosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[117, 5, 12, 2180, 32, 3, 419, 2166, 266, 1, 1061, 12, 332, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 137, 3, 123, 1, 2180, 332, 29, 3, 69, 3727, 32, 44, 149, 1784, 673, 21, 426, 8, 1556, 206, 1, 69, 210, 123, 4660, 366, 35, 2180, 147, 21, 3080, 3388, 4995, 11347, 14657, 2, 2482, 11471, 6, 255, 983, 2495, 94, 17, 409, 4660, 107, 117, 5, 2180, 7171, 1042, 446, 625, 1647, 6153, 45, 2384, 2, 426, 74, 5763, 21, 8040, 3989, 159, 2384, 768, 6, 3401, 563, 499, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 24, 9188, 15, 112, 4660, 563, 499, 2232, 343, 1, 26081, 991, 94, 2867, 1647, 6153, 2384, 11, 446, 1, 92, 8, 181, 1, 428, 94, 9091, 3, 1680, 371, 3, 96, 841, 95, 1805, 2956, 11, 3, 1865, 2533, 9, 389, 2, 24, 1, 12, 372, 1, 358, 1770, 1793, 201, 4359, 5144, 6273, 78, 83, 978, 1297, 511, 1770, 4086, 511, 78, 66, 3, 583, 455, 1, 12, 36, 1083, 1991, 499, 78, 33, 2, 3, 1061, 2232, 343, 558, 22278, 78, 39, 1661, 10, 41, 5, 280, 372, 1, 358, 1001, 2, 900, 2702, 24, 267, 1424, 392, 123, 3553, 1228, 627, 4, 380, 1001, 123, 76, 3274, 6269, 1536, 10, 41, 5, 380, 123, 72, 6, 1455, 1345, 121, 2232, 343, 123, 11, 470, 23, 89, 98, 1192, 147, 2, 1041, 12824, 8, 1473, 348, 8534, 4, 2232, 2042, 4, 352, 8, 900, 128, 788, 10, 41, 5, 231, 2232, 1333, 84, 44, 2232, 343, 114, 206, 777, 2670, 237, 3, 730, 1, 2180, 332, 29, 3, 69, 3727, 130, 17, 1248, 6, 1001, 225, 22, 559, 613, 2671, 2, 2032, 2702, 257, 40, 2909, 366, 35, 2180, 147]",1878.0,29150143,Life endometrial systematic review patient-reported outcomes,5,0.02512562814070352
Development of a goat model for evaluation of withaferin A: Cervical implants for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,Experimental and molecular pathology,Exp. Mol. Pathol.,2017-11-21,"Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). The disease develops over many years through a series of precancerous lesions. Cervical cancer can be prevented by HPV-vaccination, screening and treatment of precancer before development of cervical cancer. The treatment of high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN <sup>2+</sup>) has traditionally been by cervical conization. Surgical procedures are associated with increased risk of undesirable side effects including bleeding, infection, scarring (stenosis), infertility and complications in later pregnancies. An inexpensive, non-invasive method of delivering therapeutics locally will be favorable to treat precancerous cervical lesions without damaging healthy tissue. The feasibility and safety of a sustained, continuous drug-releasing cervical polymeric implant for use in clinical trials was studied using a large animal model. The goat (Capra hircus), non-pregnant adult female Boer goats, was chosen due to similarities in cervical dimensions to the human. Estrus was induced with progesterone CIDR® vaginal implants for 14days followed by the administration of chorionic gonadotropins 48h prior to removal of the progesterone implants to relax the cervix to allow for the placement of the cervical implant. Cervical implants, containing 2% and 4% withaferin A (WFA), with 8 coats of blank polymer, provided sustained release for a long duration and were used for the animal study. The 'mushroom'-shaped cervical polymeric implant, originally designed for women required redesigning to be accommodated within the goat cervix. The cervical implants were well tolerated by the animals with no obvious evidence of discomfort, systemic or local inflammation or toxicity. In addition, we developed a new method to analyze tissue WFA levels by solvent extractions and LS/MS-MS.

Systemic and local effects of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): NCCTG N10C1 (Alliance).,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2017-11-21,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is helpful for treating vaginal symptoms. This secondary analysis evaluated the impact of vaginal DHEA on hormone concentrations, bone turnover, and vaginal cytology in women with a cancer history. Postmenopausal women, diagnosed with breast or gynecologic cancer, were eligible if they reported at least moderate vaginal symptoms. Participants could be on tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Women were randomized to 3.25 versus 6.5 mg/day of DHEA versus a plain moisturizer (PM) control. Sex steroid hormone levels, biomarkers of bone formation, vaginal pH, and maturation index were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. Analysis included independent t tests and Wilcoxon rank tests, comparing each DHEA arm with the control. Three hundred forty-five women contributed evaluable blood and 46 contributed evaluable cytology and pH values. Circulating DHEA-S and testosterone levels were significantly increased in those on vaginal DHEA in a dose-dependent manner compared to PM. Estradiol was significantly increased in those on 6.5 mg/day DHEA but not in those on 3.25 mg/day DHEA (p < 0.05 and p = 0.05, respectively), and not in those on AIs. Biomarkers of bone formation were unchanged in all arms. Maturation of vaginal cells was 100% (3.25 mg/day), 86% (6.5 mg/day), and 64% (PM); pH decreased more in DHEA arms. DHEA resulted in increased hormone concentrations, though still in the lowest half or quartile of the postmenopausal range, and provided more favorable effects on vaginal cytology, compared to PM. Estrogen concentrations in women on AIs were not changed. Further research on the benefit of vaginal DHEA is warranted in hormone-dependent cancers.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",791.0,5.0,Dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA helpful treating vaginal symptoms secondary evaluated impact vaginal DHEA hormone concentrations bone turnover vaginal cytology women history Postmenopausal women diagnosed breast gynecologic eligible reported moderate vaginal symptoms Participants tamoxifen aromatase inhibitors AIs Women randomized 3.25 versus 6.5 mg/day DHEA versus plain moisturizer PM control Sex steroid hormone levels biomarkers bone formation vaginal pH maturation index collected baseline 12 weeks included independent tests Wilcoxon rank tests comparing DHEA arm control forty-five women contributed evaluable blood 46 contributed evaluable cytology pH values Circulating DHEA-S testosterone levels significantly increased vaginal DHEA dose-dependent manner compared PM Estradiol significantly increased 6.5 mg/day DHEA 3.25 mg/day DHEA p 0.05 p 0.05 respectively AIs Biomarkers bone formation unchanged arms Maturation vaginal 100 3.25 mg/day 86 6.5 mg/day 64 PM pH decreased DHEA arms DHEA resulted increased hormone concentrations lowest half quartile postmenopausal range provided favorable effects vaginal cytology compared PM Estrogen concentrations women AIs changed research benefit vaginal DHEA warranted hormone-dependent,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12317, 10850, 16, 3951, 9, 1367, 507, 26, 568, 65, 194, 3, 345, 1, 10850, 23, 785, 1003, 5445, 2, 2045, 4, 117, 5, 8, 12, 532, 1679, 117, 265, 5, 15, 1512, 12, 11, 625, 492, 491, 210, 28, 506, 1163, 507, 776, 359, 40, 23, 1105, 15, 2106, 222, 3826, 117, 11, 384, 6, 27, 243, 185, 49, 33, 81, 218, 1, 10850, 185, 8, 15858, 34860, 3377, 182, 1035, 3853, 785, 148, 582, 1, 1264, 2058, 2, 4537, 558, 11, 786, 28, 330, 2, 133, 244, 65, 159, 306, 102, 895, 2, 3896, 1026, 895, 1430, 296, 10850, 475, 5, 3, 182, 169, 1128, 1213, 365, 117, 3447, 859, 315, 2, 641, 3447, 859, 2045, 2, 2058, 1030, 1033, 10850, 695, 2, 2660, 148, 11, 97, 101, 4, 135, 23, 10850, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 72, 6, 3377, 4507, 10, 97, 101, 4, 135, 23, 49, 33, 81, 218, 10850, 84, 44, 4, 135, 23, 27, 243, 81, 218, 10850, 19, 13, 474, 2, 19, 13, 474, 106, 2, 44, 4, 135, 23, 3826, 582, 1, 1264, 11, 4639, 4, 62, 1335, 4537, 1, 37, 10, 394, 27, 243, 81, 218, 868, 49, 33, 81, 218, 2, 660, 3377, 2058, 340, 80, 4, 10850, 1335, 10850, 627, 4, 101, 785, 1003, 2471, 1234, 4, 3, 2101, 1303, 15, 3708, 1, 3, 1679, 184, 2, 1052, 80, 913, 176, 23, 2045, 72, 6, 3377, 808, 1003, 4, 117, 23, 3826, 11, 44, 2368, 195, 389, 23, 3, 247, 1, 10850, 16, 1197, 4, 785, 470, 163]",1553.0,29164377,Systemic local effects vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA NCCTG N10C1 Alliance,0,0.0

We describe a new surgical approach employing a minimally-invasive resection and immediate reconstruction. Records from 4 consecutive patients with localized vaginal RMS managed in 4 major pediatric referral centers were reviewed. All cases were performed with a standardized technique. Patients were diagnosed at a median age of 24months. Each underwent a total/subtotal vaginectomy with autologous buccal graft vaginal replacement. Final margins were focally positive in one patient and negative in three. None received radiotherapy. To date, all patients have patent buccal neovaginas, enjoy a favorable aesthetic result, and remain disease-free at a median follow-up of 35months. We report 4 cases of localized vaginal RMS successfully treated with a minimally invasive surgical approach. All patients have avoided radiation and remain disease-free.

Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant intravaginal brachytherapy in high-intermediate risk endometrial carcinoma.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2017-12-21,"We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant intravaginal brachytherapy (IVBT) vs. observation after total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TH/BSO) for high-intermediate risk (HIR) endometrial carcinoma. A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of IVBT by comparing average cumulative costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between patients allocated to (1) 'observation' or (2) 'IVBT' after TH/BSO. We used a prototype Post-Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma (PORTEC)-defined HIR patient in the base case analysis. We calibrated the model to match the outcomes reported in the PORTEC-1 and PORTEC-2 trials. Utilities were obtained from published estimates, and costs were calculated based on Medicare reimbursement ($5445 for IVBT). The societal willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY. The time horizon was 5 years. IVBT was associated with a net increase of 0.094 QALYs (4.512 vs. 4.418) as well as an increase in mean cost ($17,453 vs. $15,620) relative to observation. The ICER for IVBT was $19,500 per QALY. On one-way sensitivity analysis, IVBT remained cost-effective when its cost was less than $12,937. If the probability of vaginal recurrence in the observation arm was increased or decreased by 25%, the ICER became $1335 per QALY and $87,925 per QALY, respectively.

Uterine rhabdomyosarcoma in adults.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-01-07,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor most commonly diagnosed in the pediatric population, and when occurring in adults, tends to develop in the deep soft tissue of the limbs. Primary uterine RMS comprises an even more restricted subset, with little known or reported when compared to most other gynecologic sarcomas. Our goal with this study was to retrospectively evaluate cases from two academic institutions and describe the main histopathologic findings of this rare gynecologic malignancy. A total of 8 cases were identified, consisting of 4 pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas (PRMS), 2 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS), and 2 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS). They occurred in patients ranging from 22 to 70 years old, and the most common presenting symptom was vaginal bleeding. Most patients presented with advanced stage at diagnosis, including metastatic disease to lymph nodes and to distant sites.

Minimally invasive hysterectomy surgery rates for endometrial cancer performed at National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Centers.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-01-12,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a quality measure for endometrial cancer (EC) established by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American College of Surgeons. Our study objective was to assess the proportion of EC cases performed by MIS at National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) centers and evaluate perioperative outcomes. A retrospective cohort study of women who underwent surgical treatment for EC from 2013 to 2014 was conducted at four NCCN centers. Multivariable mixed logistic regression models analyzed factors associated with failure to perform MIS and perioperative complications. In total 1621 patients were evaluated; 86.5% underwent MIS (robotic-assisted 72.5%, laparoscopic 20.9%, vaginal 6.6%). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with failure to undergo MIS were uterine size >12cm (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.9), stage III (OR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.49) and IV disease (OR: 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.22). For stage I/II disease, complications occurred in 5.1% of MIS and 21.7% of laparotomy cases (p<0.01). Laparotomy was associated with increases in any complication (OR: 6.0, 95% CI 3.3-10.8), gastrointestinal (OR: 7.2, 95% CI 2.6-19.5), wound (OR: 3.7, 95% CI 1.5-9.2), respiratory (OR 37.5, 95% CI 3.9-358.0), VTE (OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.3-82.8) and 30-day readmission (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.9) compared to MIS. At NCCN-designated centers, the MIS hysterectomy rate in EC is higher than the published national average, with low perioperative complications. Previously identified disparities of age, race, and BMI were not observed.

"Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Radical Surgery Versus Concomitant Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Patients With Stage IB2, IIA, or IIB Squamous Cervical Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-02-12,"Purpose We compared the efficacy and toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery versus standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced squamous cervical cancer. Patients and Methods This was a single-center, phase III, randomized controlled trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00193739). Eligible patients were between 18 and 65 years old and had stage IB2, IIA, or IIB squamous cervical cancer. They were randomly assigned, after stratification by stage, to receive either three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin once every 3 weeks followed by radical hysterectomy or standard radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin once every week for 5 weeks. Patients in the neoadjuvant group received postoperative adjuvant radiation or concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if indicated. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as survival without relapse or death related to cancer, and secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. Results Between September 2003 and February 2015, 635 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 633 (316 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group and 317 patients in the concomitant chemoradiation group) were included in the final analysis, with a median follow-up time of 58.5 months. The 5-year DFS in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group was 69.3% compared with 76.7% in the concomitant chemoradiation group (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.87; P = .038), whereas the corresponding 5-year OS rates were 75.4% and 74.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.025; 95% CI, 0.752 to 1.398; P = .87). The delayed toxicities at 24 months or later after treatment completion in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group versus the concomitant chemoradiation group were rectal (2.2% v 3.5%, respectively), bladder (1.6% v 3.5%, respectively), and vaginal (12.0% v 25.6%, respectively). Conclusion Cisplatin-based concomitant chemoradiation resulted in superior DFS compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery in locally advanced cervical cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",708.0,61.0,Purpose compared efficacy toxicity neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed radical surgery versus standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation patients locally advanced squamous cervical Patients Methods single-center phase III randomized controlled trial ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00193739 Eligible patients 18 65 years old stage IB2 IIA IIB squamous cervical randomly assigned stratification stage receive cycles neoadjuvant chemotherapy paclitaxel carboplatin 3 weeks followed radical hysterectomy standard radiotherapy concomitant cisplatin week 5 weeks Patients neoadjuvant group received postoperative adjuvant radiation concomitant chemotherapy radiotherapy indicated primary end point disease-free survival DFS defined survival relapse death related secondary end points included overall survival toxicity September 2003 February 2015 635 patients randomly assigned 633 316 patients neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group 317 patients concomitant chemoradiation group included final median follow-up time 58.5 months 5-year DFS neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group 69.3 compared 76.7 concomitant chemoradiation group hazard ratio 1.38 95 CI 1.02 1.87 P .038 corresponding 5-year OS rates 75.4 74.7 respectively hazard ratio 1.025 95 CI 0.752 1.398 P .87 delayed toxicities 24 months later treatment completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery group versus concomitant chemoradiation group rectal 2.2 v 3.5 respectively bladder 1.6 v 3.5 respectively vaginal 12.0 v 25.6 respectively Cisplatin-based concomitant chemoradiation resulted superior DFS compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed radical surgery locally advanced cervical,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[743, 21, 72, 3, 209, 2, 155, 1, 536, 56, 370, 20, 711, 152, 185, 260, 540, 90, 975, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 691, 12, 7, 2, 636, 26, 10, 8, 226, 574, 124, 316, 384, 1149, 160, 1252, 1239, 3719, 72140, 625, 7, 11, 59, 203, 2, 556, 60, 1095, 2, 42, 82, 9537, 4088, 15, 3884, 691, 12, 491, 11, 1108, 896, 50, 1541, 20, 82, 6, 560, 361, 169, 410, 1, 536, 56, 75, 490, 2, 927, 1059, 454, 27, 244, 370, 20, 711, 2622, 15, 260, 310, 5, 1781, 540, 1059, 454, 647, 9, 33, 244, 7, 4, 3, 536, 87, 103, 573, 249, 121, 15, 1781, 56, 2, 310, 492, 1103, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 34, 115, 25, 1010, 395, 22, 25, 187, 429, 15, 273, 139, 6, 12, 2, 568, 396, 862, 159, 63, 25, 2, 155, 99, 59, 2636, 1522, 2, 3010, 1483, 12254, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 1, 953, 11967, 8500, 7, 4, 3, 536, 56, 349, 152, 87, 2, 7869, 7, 4, 3, 1781, 975, 87, 11, 159, 4, 3, 1457, 65, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 98, 1, 717, 33, 53, 3, 33, 111, 1010, 4, 3, 536, 56, 349, 152, 87, 10, 790, 27, 72, 5, 846, 67, 4, 3, 1781, 975, 87, 360, 197, 14, 519, 48, 58, 14, 588, 6, 14, 912, 19, 5215, 547, 3, 1734, 33, 111, 118, 151, 11, 481, 39, 2, 794, 67, 106, 360, 197, 14, 4067, 48, 58, 13, 11611, 6, 14, 8336, 19, 912, 3, 1612, 385, 28, 259, 53, 15, 1559, 50, 24, 1438, 4, 3, 536, 56, 349, 152, 87, 185, 3, 1781, 975, 87, 11, 18, 18, 603, 27, 33, 106, 14, 49, 603, 27, 33, 106, 2, 133, 13, 603, 243, 49, 106, 1221, 540, 90, 1781, 975, 627, 4, 1123, 1010, 72, 5, 536, 56, 370, 20, 711, 152, 4, 795, 131, 12]",2031.0,29432076,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed Radical Surgery Versus Concomitant Chemotherapy Radiotherapy Patients Stage IB2 IIA IIB Squamous Cervical Randomized Controlled Trial,2,0.010050251256281407
Factors Predictive of Receiving Adjuvant Radiotherapy in High-Intermediate-Risk Stage I Endometrial Cancer.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2018-06-01,"Randomized trials have shown a local control benefit with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients, although not all such patients receive RT. We reviewed the National Cancer Data Base to investigate which patient/tumor-related factors are associated with delivery of adjuvant RT. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage I endometrioid adenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2012 who underwent surgery +/- adjuvant RT. Exclusion criteria were unknown stage/grade, nonsurgical primary therapy, less than 30 days' follow-up, RT of more than 6 months after surgery, or palliative treatment. High-intermediate risk was defined based on Post Operative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma 2 criteria: older than 60 years with stage IA grade 3 or stage IB grade 1-2. Seventeen thousand five hundred twenty-four met inclusion criteria, and the 13,651 patients with complete data were subjected to a multiple logistic regression analysis; 7814 (57.2%) received surgery alone, and 5837 (42.8%) received surgery + RT. Receipt of adjuvant RT was more likely among black women and women with higher income, Northeastern residence, diagnosis after 2010, greater than 50% myometrial invasion, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Patients older than 80 years or those undergoing lymph node dissection were less likely to receive adjuvant RT (P < 0.05). Of those treated with RT, 44.0% received external beam therapy, 54.8% received vaginal cuff brachytherapy, and 0.6% received both. Among irradiated women, patients older than 80 years and those with Northeastern residence, treatment at academic facilities, diagnosis after 2004, and lymph node dissection were more likely to undergo brachytherapy over external beam radiation therapy (P < 0.05).

Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with or at high risk for breast cancer: consensus recommendations from The North American Menopause Society and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health.,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",Menopause,2018-06-01,"The objective of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) Expert Consensus Panel was to create a point of care algorithm for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women with or at high risk for breast cancer. The consensus recommendations will assist healthcare providers in managing GSM with a goal of improving the care and quality of life for these women. The Expert Consensus Panel is comprised of a diverse group of 16 multidisciplinary experts well respected in their fields. The panelists individually conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in their respective areas of expertise. They then met to discuss the latest treatment options for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in survivors of breast cancer and review management strategies for GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involved presentations summarizing the current literature, debate, and discussion of divergent opinions concerning GSM assessment and management, leading to the development of consensus recommendations for the clinician.Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is more prevalent in survivors of breast cancer, is commonly undiagnosed and untreated, and may have early onset because of cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety of vaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer has resulted in avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality of life and intimate relationships. Factors influencing decision-making regarding treatment for GSM include breast cancer recurrence risk, severity of symptoms, response to prior therapies, and personal preference.We review current evidence for various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities in women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer and highlight the substantial gaps in the evidence for safe and effective therapies and the need for future research. Treatment of GSM is individualized, with nonhormone treatments generally being first line in this population. The use of local hormone therapies may be an option for some women who fail nonpharmacologic and nonhormone treatments after a discussion of risks and benefits and review with a woman's oncologist. We provide consensus recommendations for an approach to the management of GSM in specific patient populations, including women at high risk for breast cancer, women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, women with triple-negative breast cancers, and women with metastatic disease.",Consensus Development Conference,599.0,26.0,objective North American Menopause Society NAMS International Society Women 's Sexual Health ISSWSH Expert Consensus Panel create point care algorithm treating genitourinary syndrome menopause GSM women high risk breast consensus recommendations assist healthcare providers managing GSM goal improving care quality life women Expert Consensus Panel comprised diverse group 16 multidisciplinary experts respected fields panelists individually conducted evidence-based review literature respective areas expertise met discuss latest treatment options genitourinary syndrome menopause GSM survivors breast review management strategies GSM women high risk breast modified Delphi iterative process involved presentations summarizing current literature debate discussion divergent opinions concerning GSM assessment management leading development consensus recommendations clinician.Genitourinary syndrome menopause prevalent survivors breast commonly undiagnosed untreated early onset treatments risk-reducing strategies paucity evidence safety vaginal hormone therapies women high risk breast resulted avoidance treatment potentially adversely affecting quality life intimate relationships Factors influencing decision-making treatment GSM include breast recurrence risk severity symptoms response prior therapies personal preference.We review current evidence pharmacologic nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities women history high risk breast highlight substantial gaps evidence safe effective therapies need future research Treatment GSM individualized nonhormone treatments generally line population use local hormone therapies option women fail nonpharmacologic nonhormone treatments discussion risks benefits review woman 's oncologist provide consensus recommendations approach management GSM specific patient populations including women high risk breast women estrogen-receptor positive breast women triple-negative breast women metastatic disease,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 461, 1, 3, 2669, 597, 5034, 1174, 29861, 2, 3, 944, 1174, 9, 3, 45, 1, 117, 292, 2232, 341, 72769, 2005, 1391, 993, 10, 6, 3736, 8, 741, 1, 165, 2124, 9, 1367, 4109, 681, 1, 5034, 19392, 4, 117, 5, 15, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 3, 1391, 883, 303, 3425, 2819, 1994, 4, 3969, 19392, 5, 8, 1326, 1, 1673, 3, 165, 2, 372, 1, 358, 9, 46, 117, 3, 2005, 1391, 993, 16, 2603, 1, 8, 1867, 87, 1, 245, 1643, 3186, 149, 30870, 4, 136, 3130, 3, 12036, 4257, 426, 35, 241, 90, 206, 1, 3, 789, 4, 136, 3847, 1361, 1, 4935, 491, 818, 543, 6, 1139, 3, 5923, 24, 838, 9, 4109, 681, 1, 5034, 19392, 4, 332, 1, 12, 2, 206, 284, 422, 9, 19392, 4, 117, 5, 15, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 75, 8, 1230, 6803, 596, 26, 10718, 1129, 646, 4261, 15693, 3, 291, 789, 5220, 2, 2488, 1, 8332, 7856, 4243, 19392, 455, 2, 284, 1049, 6, 3, 193, 1, 1391, 883, 9, 3, 3744, 4109, 681, 1, 5034, 16, 80, 2485, 4, 332, 1, 12, 16, 841, 11615, 2, 1278, 2, 68, 47, 191, 1707, 408, 1, 12, 640, 15, 43, 1818, 422, 3, 4832, 1, 241, 666, 3, 367, 1, 785, 235, 4, 117, 5, 15, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 71, 627, 4, 5863, 1, 24, 751, 4311, 2319, 372, 1, 358, 2, 14894, 2467, 130, 4743, 948, 1079, 666, 24, 9, 19392, 643, 12, 146, 43, 1702, 1, 507, 51, 6, 324, 235, 2, 3008, 3863, 21, 206, 291, 241, 9, 747, 2788, 2, 11803, 189, 1558, 4, 117, 5, 8, 532, 1, 15, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 2, 1817, 3, 1281, 5287, 4, 3, 241, 9, 1165, 2, 323, 235, 2, 3, 594, 9, 508, 389, 24, 1, 19392, 16, 2596, 5, 51064, 640, 1228, 486, 157, 328, 4, 26, 266, 3, 119, 1, 293, 785, 235, 68, 40, 35, 1501, 9, 476, 117, 54, 4373, 11803, 2, 51064, 640, 50, 8, 2488, 1, 1098, 2, 1141, 2, 206, 5, 8, 2854, 292, 2709, 21, 377, 1391, 883, 9, 35, 353, 6, 3, 284, 1, 19392, 4, 112, 69, 1184, 141, 117, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 117, 5, 808, 153, 109, 163, 117, 5, 1500, 199, 163, 2, 117, 5, 113, 34]",2581.0,29762200,Management genitourinary syndrome menopause women high risk breast consensus recommendations North American Menopause Society International Society Women 's Sexual Health,0,0.0
Localized vaginal/uterine rhabdomyosarcoma-results of a pooled analysis from four international cooperative groups.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-05-21,"Vaginal/uterine rhabdomyosarcoma (VU RMS) is one of the most favorable RMS sites. To determine the optimal therapy, the experience of four cooperative groups (Children's Oncology Group [COG], International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Group [MMT], Italian Cooperative Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group [ICG], and European pediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group [EpSSG]) was analyzed. From 1981 to 2009, 237 patients were identified. Median age (years) at diagnosis differed by tumor location; it was 1.9 for vagina (n = 160), 2.7 for uterus corpus (n = 26), and 13.5 for uterus cervix (n = 51). Twenty-eight percent of patients received radiation therapy (RT) as part of primary therapy (23% COG, 27% MMT, 46% ICG, and 42% EpSSG), with significant differences in the use of brachytherapy between the cooperative groups (23% COG, 76% MMT, 64% ICG, and 88% EpSSG). Ten-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 74% (95% CI, 67-79%) and 92% (95% CI, 88-96%), respectively. In univariate analysis, OS was inferior for patients with uterine RMS and for those with regional lymph node involvement. Although EFS was slightly lower in patients without initial RT (71% without RT vs. 81% with RT; P = 0.08), there was no difference in OS (94% without RT vs. 89% with RT; P = 0.18). Local control using brachytherapy was excellent (93%). Fifty-one (51.5%) of the 99 survivors with known primary therapy and treatment for relapse were cured with chemotherapy with or without conservative surgery. About half of all patients with VU RMS can be cured without systematic RT or radical surgery. When RT is indicated, modalities that limit sequelae should be considered, such as brachytherapy.",Journal Article,610.0,1.0,Vaginal/uterine rhabdomyosarcoma VU RMS favorable RMS sites determine optimal therapy experience cooperative groups Children 's Oncology Group COG International Society Pediatric Oncology SIOP Malignant Mesenchymal Group MMT Italian Cooperative Soft Tissue Sarcoma Group ICG European pediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Group EpSSG 1981 2009 237 patients identified Median age years diagnosis differed location 1.9 vagina n 160 2.7 uterus corpus n 26 13.5 uterus cervix n 51 Twenty-eight percent patients received radiation therapy RT primary therapy 23 COG 27 MMT 46 ICG 42 EpSSG significant differences use brachytherapy cooperative groups 23 COG 76 MMT 64 ICG 88 EpSSG Ten-year event-free EFS overall survival OS 74 95 CI 67-79 92 95 CI 88-96 respectively univariate OS inferior patients uterine RMS regional lymph node involvement EFS slightly lower patients initial RT 71 RT vs. 81 RT P 0.08 difference OS 94 RT vs. 89 RT P 0.18 Local control brachytherapy excellent 93 Fifty-one 51.5 99 survivors known primary therapy treatment relapse cured chemotherapy conservative surgery half patients VU RMS cured systematic RT radical surgery RT indicated modalities limit sequelae considered brachytherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[18982, 16369, 51072, 3413, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 913, 3413, 633, 6, 223, 3, 665, 36, 3, 730, 1, 294, 1690, 271, 541, 292, 413, 87, 6377, 944, 1174, 1, 815, 413, 28737, 393, 1569, 30, 87, 17947, 10215, 1690, 1214, 246, 87, 9118, 2, 1865, 815, 1214, 246, 45, 87, 42067, 10, 311, 29, 10264, 6, 1238, 7296, 7, 11, 108, 52, 89, 60, 28, 147, 2512, 20, 30, 1147, 192, 10, 14, 83, 9, 7553, 78, 3457, 18, 67, 9, 7758, 78, 432, 2, 233, 33, 9, 3629, 78, 725, 737, 659, 714, 1, 7, 103, 121, 36, 240, 22, 760, 1, 86, 36, 382, 6377, 428, 17947, 641, 9118, 2, 595, 42067, 5, 93, 362, 4, 3, 119, 1, 1536, 59, 3, 1690, 271, 382, 6377, 846, 17947, 660, 9118, 2, 889, 42067, 1618, 111, 774, 115, 1683, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 794, 48, 58, 598, 842, 2, 937, 48, 58, 889, 921, 106, 4, 880, 65, 118, 10, 1663, 9, 7, 5, 3413, 2, 9, 135, 5, 951, 263, 289, 799, 242, 1683, 10, 3223, 280, 4, 7, 187, 388, 240, 792, 187, 240, 105, 865, 5, 240, 19, 13, 1592, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 118, 960, 187, 240, 105, 887, 5, 240, 19, 13, 203, 293, 182, 75, 1536, 10, 1503, 966, 1461, 104, 725, 33, 1, 3, 1058, 332, 5, 440, 86, 36, 2, 24, 9, 429, 11, 3733, 5, 56, 5, 15, 187, 4476, 152, 545, 1303, 1, 62, 7, 5, 51072, 3413, 122, 40, 3733, 187, 1556, 240, 15, 711, 152, 198, 240, 16, 1103, 1558, 17, 2385, 4156, 257, 40, 515, 225, 22, 1536]",1555.0,29781567,Localized vaginal/uterine rhabdomyosarcoma-results pooled international cooperative groups,1,0.005025125628140704
The influence of surgeon volume on outcomes after pelvic exenteration for a gynecologic cancer.,Journal of gynecologic oncology,J Gynecol Oncol,2018-05-04,"To determine the effect of surgeon experience on intraoperative, postoperative and long-term outcomes among patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for gynecologic cancer. This was a retrospective analysis of all women who underwent exenteration for a gynecologic malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center, between January 1993 and June 2013. A logistic regression was used to model the relationship between surgeon experience (measured as the number of exenteration cases performed by the surgeon prior to a given exenteration) and operative outcomes and postoperative complications. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival outcomes. A total of 167 exenterations were performed by 19 surgeons for cervix (78, 46.7%), vaginal (43, 25.8%), uterine (24, 14.4%), vulvar (14, 8.4%) and other cancer (8, 4.7%). The most common procedure was total pelvic exenteration (69.4%), incontinent urinary diversion (63.5%) and vertical rectus abdominis musculocutaneous reconstruction (42.5%). Surgical experience was associated with decreased estimated blood loss (p<0.001), intraoperative transfusion (p=0.009) and a shorter length of stay (p=0.03). No difference was noted in the postoperative complication rate (p=0.12-0.95).

We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with stage I or II uterine carcinosarcoma at our institution between March 1990 and June 2016. All pathology had been reviewed and confirmed by gynecologic pathologists. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to compare clinicopathologic characteristics. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for survival outcomes. 140 patients were identified. Median age was 67 years (range: 36-91). Median follow-up was 39.1 months (2.9-297.4). The majority of patients had stage IA (67%) versus stage IB (21%) or stage II (11%) disease. The majority of patients (63%) received adjuvant treatment: vaginal brachytherapy only (14%); whole pelvic radiation therapy only (16%); chemotherapy only (n = 13, 9%); combination chemotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy (15%); combination chemotherapy and whole pelvic radiation (9%). 52 patients (37%) received no adjuvant therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 48.0 months (95% CI 32.7-80.9).

Trends in Risks for Second Primary Cancers Associated With Index Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-09-07,"In the last 4 decades, survival among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers has improved, while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts. Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers, persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers (HPV-SPCs). To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades. A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile) cancers diagnosed from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2014. The dates of analysis were July 1, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10 000 person-years at risk (PYR). The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression. From 113 272 (73 085 female and 40 187 male) survivors of HPV-associated cancers, 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs. The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 (95% CI, 5.9-6.6) among women and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.8) among men. The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men. Among both women and men, those who had index oropharyngeal cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 19.8 [95% CI, 18.4-21.4] and EAR, 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 18.0 [95% CI, 16.9-19.1] and EAR, 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Women who had index cervical cancers and men who had index anal cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] and EAR, 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.7-8.8] and EAR, 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of oropharyngeal HPV-SPCs. Over the last 4 decades, the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers increased. According to this study, the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant, implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs.

Bidirectional Text Messaging to Monitor Endocrine Therapy Adherence and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Breast Cancer.,JCO clinical cancer informatics,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,2017-11-01,"Up to 40% of patients with breast cancer may not adhere to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Therapy-related adverse effects (AEs) are important contributors to nonadherence. We developed a bidirectional text-message application, BETA-Text, that simultaneously tracks adherence, records symptoms, and alerts the clinical team. We piloted our intervention in 100 patients. The intervention consisted of text messages to which patients responded for 3 months: daily, evaluating adherence; weekly, evaluating medication-related AEs; and monthly, regarding barriers to adherence. Concerning responses prompted a telephone call from a clinic nurse. The primary objective was to assess patient acceptance of this intervention using self-reported surveys. To compare participants with the general population at our institution, we assessed 100 consecutively treated patients as historical controls using medical record review. We approached 141 consecutive patients, 100 (71%) of whom agreed to participate and 89 of whom completed the intervention. A majority of patients reported that the intervention was easy to use (98%) and helpful in taking their medication (96%). Four patients discontinued therapy before 3 months, and 93% of patients who continued therapy took ≥ 80% of their medication. The frequency of AEs reported by participants via text was higher than that reported in clinical trials: hot flashes (72%), arthralgias (53%), and vaginal symptoms (35%). Approximately 39% of patients reported one or more severe AE that prompted an alert to the provider team to call the patient. A daily bidirectional text-messaging system can monitor adherence and identify AEs and other barriers to adherence in real time without inconveniencing patients.

Prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia among women with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia or cancer: Results of a pilot study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"To estimate the prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent anal cytology, anal HPV testing with Cervista HPV16/18 and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Patients with HSIL (high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion) or greater on anal cytology or anal biopsy were referred to a colorectal surgery specialist for further evaluation. Seventy-five women were enrolled in the study, including 47 with cervical (cervix group), 10 with vaginal (vagina group), 15 with vulvar (vulva group), 1 with cervical and vaginal, and 2 with vulvar and vaginal disease. The median age in the cervix group (40 years (range 26-69)) was substantially younger than in the vagina (60 years (38-69)) and the vulva (59 years (36-75)) groups. Anal HSIL based on composite endpoints of the most severe cytology or histology result was diagnosed in 6 patients (8.0%). Anal cytology revealed HSIL in 2 (2.7%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) in 12 (16.0%), low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 2 (2.7%), and was normal in 59 (78.7%) patients. Anal HPV16/18 test was positive in 15 (20.0%), negative in 48 (64.0%) and insufficient in 12 (16.0%) patients. Of the 6 women with high-grade anal dysplasia, three (50%) had a positive anal HPV16/18 test. No case of anal cancer was observed. Our results suggest that the prevalence of anal HSIL is elevated among women with HPV-related lower genital tract dysplasia or cancer.

"National trends, outcomes, and costs of radiation therapy in the management of low- and high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"To assess treatment patterns, outcomes, and costs for women with low-(LIR) and high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer (HIR) who are treated with and without adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer who underwent surgery from 2000 to 2011 were identified from the SEER-Medicare database. LIR was defined as G1-2 tumors with <50% myometrial invasion or G3 with no invasion. HIR was defined as G1-2 tumors with ≥50% or G3 with <50% invasion. Patients were categorized according to whether they received adjuvant radiotherapy (vaginal brachytherapy [VBT], external beam radiotherapy [EBRT], or both) or no radiotherapy. Outcomes were analyzed and compared (primary outcome was overall survival). 10,842 patients met inclusion criteria. In the LIR group (n = 7609), there was no difference in 10-year overall survival between patients who received radiotherapy and those who did not (67% vs 65%, adjusted HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81-1.11). In the HIR group (n = 3233), patients who underwent radiotherapy had a significant increase in survival (60% vs 47%, aHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.85). Radiotherapy was associated with increased costs compared to surgery alone ($26,585 vs $16,712, p < .001). Costs for patients receiving VBT, EBRT, and concurrent VBT/EBRT were $24,044, $27,512, and $31,564, respectively (p < .001).

Evolving trends in the management of high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer in the United States.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"Gynecologic oncology group protocol 249 (GOG 249) is the contemporary US study that aimed to define the standard of care adjuvant therapy for patients with high-intermediate risk (HIR) endometrial cancer; patients were randomized to pelvic radiation therapy (RT) or vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) with chemotherapy (VBT-C). The preliminary results of GOG 249 were recently presented, yet the management of patients represented in this trial remains controversial. We set out to review US patterns of care for patients meeting eligibility criteria for GOG 249. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients meeting GOG 249 eligibility criteria between 2010 and 2015. The Man-Kendall trend test was used to assess for significant trends over time. We identified 23,015 patients that met study inclusion criteria. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a decline in the use of pelvic RT from 9.8% to 7.5%, although not meeting statistical significance (p = 0.136), and an increase in the use of VBT-C from 4.6% to 7.7% (p = 0.017). Most patients did not receive treatment per either arm of GOG 249, with observation being the most common approach throughout this era, although the percentage of patients observed decreased from 58.1% to 45.8% between 2010 and 2015 (p = 0.003). Further, 21.5% of patients received VBT alone in 2010, increasing to 30.3% by 2015 (p = 0.003). National practice trends in HIR endometrial cancer reveal that a large number of patients are observed in lieu of receiving adjuvant therapy. Further, the utilization of pelvic RT has declined below utilization of VBT-C, despite a lack of data supporting either improved disease outcomes or toxicity with this experimental regimen on GOG 249.",Journal Article,326.0,0.0,"Gynecologic oncology group protocol 249 GOG 249 contemporary aimed define standard care adjuvant therapy patients high-intermediate risk HIR endometrial patients randomized pelvic radiation therapy RT vaginal brachytherapy VBT chemotherapy VBT-C preliminary GOG 249 recently presented management patients represented trial remains controversial set review patterns care patients meeting eligibility criteria GOG 249 National Database NCDB identify patients meeting GOG 249 eligibility criteria 2010 2015 Man-Kendall trend test assess significant trends time identified 23,015 patients met inclusion criteria 2010 2015 decline use pelvic RT 9.8 7.5 meeting statistical significance p 0.136 increase use VBT-C 4.6 7.7 p 0.017 patients receive treatment arm GOG 249 observation common approach era percentage patients observed decreased 58.1 45.8 2010 2015 p 0.003 21.5 patients received VBT 2010 increasing 30.3 2015 p 0.003 National practice trends HIR endometrial reveal large number patients observed lieu receiving adjuvant therapy utilization pelvic RT declined utilization VBT-C despite lack supporting improved disease outcomes toxicity experimental regimen GOG 249",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1512, 413, 87, 1182, 7144, 4760, 7144, 16, 3, 2667, 843, 45, 17, 1295, 6, 1107, 3, 260, 1, 165, 249, 36, 9, 7, 5, 64, 919, 43, 19814, 12, 7, 11, 384, 6, 1110, 121, 36, 240, 15, 1536, 15050, 5, 56, 15050, 256, 3, 1676, 99, 1, 4760, 7144, 11, 761, 917, 1145, 3, 284, 1, 7, 3324, 4, 26, 160, 469, 2010, 21, 916, 1205, 6, 206, 843, 764, 1, 165, 9, 7, 2238, 2317, 371, 9, 4760, 7144, 3, 657, 12, 609, 4315, 10, 95, 6, 255, 7, 2238, 4760, 7144, 2317, 371, 59, 1120, 2, 1483, 3, 3628, 11657, 853, 412, 10, 95, 6, 423, 9, 93, 1963, 252, 98, 21, 108, 382, 3433, 7, 17, 543, 45, 1680, 371, 59, 1120, 2, 1483, 125, 10, 8, 1858, 4, 3, 119, 1, 1110, 240, 29, 83, 66, 6, 67, 33, 242, 44, 2238, 1050, 724, 19, 13, 4829, 2, 35, 344, 4, 3, 119, 1, 15050, 256, 29, 39, 49, 6, 67, 67, 19, 13, 3825, 96, 7, 205, 44, 560, 24, 379, 361, 475, 1, 4760, 7144, 5, 1664, 486, 3, 96, 186, 353, 2432, 26, 1713, 242, 3, 1150, 1, 7, 164, 340, 29, 717, 14, 6, 512, 66, 59, 1120, 2, 1483, 19, 13, 1421, 195, 239, 33, 1, 7, 103, 15050, 279, 4, 1120, 602, 6, 201, 27, 20, 1483, 19, 13, 1421, 657, 758, 1963, 4, 19814, 12, 2396, 17, 8, 375, 207, 1, 7, 32, 164, 4, 14575, 1, 357, 249, 36, 195, 3, 1961, 1, 1110, 240, 71, 3054, 2736, 1961, 1, 15050, 256, 550, 8, 926, 1, 74, 1912, 361, 231, 34, 123, 15, 155, 5, 26, 1560, 477, 23, 4760, 7144]",1634.0,30876498,Evolving trends management high-intermediate risk endometrial United States,19,0.09547738693467336

We conducted a case-control study and searched Texas Medicaid databases between 2008 and 2012 for eligible cancer patients. A comparison group was selected for each cancer site using a 2-step 1:1 propensity score matching method. Patients were followed for 2 years after cancer diagnosis to estimate monthly and yearly direct medical costs. For each cancer site, the differential cost between patients and the matched comparison individuals was the estimated cost associated with cancer. The study included 583 cervical, 62 vaginal, and 137 vulvar cancer patients and equal numbers of cancer-free comparison individuals. Among the cases, 322 cervical cancer patients, 46 vaginal cancer patients, and 102 vulvar cancer patients were Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible enrollees. For Medicaid-only enrollees, the adjusted first- and second-year mean total differential costs were US $19,859 and $3,110 for cervical cancer, US $19,627 and $4,582 for vaginal cancer, and US $7,631 and $777 for vulvar cancer patients, respectively. For Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible enrollees, adjusted first- and second-year mean total differential costs incurred by Medicaid were US $2,565 and $792 for cervical cancer, US $1,293 and $181 for vaginal cancer, and US $1,774 and $1,049 for vulvar cancer patients, respectively.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy plus Radiation for Locally Advanced Endometrial Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2019-06-01,"Stage III or IVA endometrial cancer carries a significant risk of systemic and locoregional recurrence. In this randomized phase 3 trial, we tested whether 6 months of platinum-based chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) is associated with longer relapse-free survival (primary end point) than six cycles of combination chemotherapy alone in patients with stage III or IVA endometrial carcinoma. Secondary end points included overall survival, acute and chronic toxic effects, and quality of life. Of the 813 patients enrolled, 736 were eligible and were included in the analysis of relapse-free survival; of those patients, 707 received the randomly assigned intervention (346 received chemoradiotherapy and 361 received chemotherapy only). The median follow-up period was 47 months. At 60 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the percentage of patients alive and relapse-free was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53 to 65) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 58% (95% CI, 53 to 64) in the chemotherapy-only group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 90% CI, 0.74 to 1.10). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with a lower 5-year incidence of vaginal recurrence (2% vs. 7%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82) and pelvic and paraaortic lymph-node recurrence (11% vs. 20%; hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.66) than chemotherapy alone, but distant recurrence was more common in association with chemoradiotherapy (27% vs. 21%; hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.86). Grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events were reported in 202 patients (58%) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 227 patients (63%) in the chemotherapy-only group. Chemotherapy plus radiation was not associated with longer relapse-free survival than chemotherapy alone in patients with stage III or IVA endometrial carcinoma.
