Compensation of BRG-1 function by Brm: insight into the role of the core SWI-SNF subunits in retinoblastoma tumor suppressor signaling.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2001-11-21,"The BRG-1 subunit of the SWI-SNF complex is involved in chromatin remodeling and has been implicated in the action of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB). Given the importance of BRG-1 in RB function, germ line BRG-1 mutations in tumorigenesis may be tantamount to RB inactivation. Therefore, in this study we assessed the behavior of cells harboring discrete BRG-1 alleles for the RB-signaling pathway. Using p16ink4a, an upstream activator of endogenous RB, or a constitutively active RB construct (PSM-RB), we determined that the majority of tumor lines with germ line defects in BRG-1 were sensitive to RB-mediated cell cycle arrest. By contrast, A427 (lung carcinoma) cells were resistant to expression of p16ink4a and PSM-RB. Analysis of the SWI-SNF subunits in the different tumor lines revealed that A427 are deficient for BRG-1 and its homologue, Brm, whereas RB-sensitive cell lines retained Brm expression. Similarly, the RB-resistant SW13 and C33A cell lines were also deficient for both BRG-1/Brm. Reintroduction of either BRG-1 or Brm into A427 or C33A cells restored RB-mediated signaling to cyclin A to cause cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this compensatory role, we observed that Brm could also drive expression of CD44. We also determined that loss of these core SWI-SNF subunits renders SW13 cells resistant to activation of the RB pathway by the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, since reintroduction of either BRG-1 or Brm into SW13 cells restored the cisplatin DNA-damage checkpoint. Together, these data demonstrate that Brm can compensate for BRG-1 loss as pertains to RB sensitivity.",Journal Article,6635.0,82.0,BRG-1 subunit SWI-SNF complex involved chromatin remodeling implicated action retinoblastoma suppressor RB Given importance BRG-1 RB function germ line BRG-1 tumorigenesis tantamount RB inactivation assessed behavior harboring discrete BRG-1 alleles RB-signaling pathway p16ink4a upstream activator endogenous RB constitutively active RB construct PSM-RB determined majority lines germ line defects BRG-1 sensitive RB-mediated cycle arrest contrast A427 lung carcinoma resistant expression p16ink4a PSM-RB SWI-SNF subunits different lines revealed A427 deficient BRG-1 homologue Brm RB-sensitive lines retained Brm expression Similarly RB-resistant SW13 C33A lines deficient BRG-1/Brm Reintroduction BRG-1 Brm A427 C33A restored RB-mediated signaling cyclin cause cycle arrest Consistent compensatory role observed Brm drive expression CD44 determined loss core SWI-SNF subunits renders SW13 resistant activation RB pathway chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin reintroduction BRG-1 Brm SW13 restored cisplatin DNA-damage checkpoint demonstrate Brm compensate BRG-1 loss pertains RB sensitivity,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 21930, 14, 3350, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 840, 16, 646, 4, 2287, 4429, 2, 71, 85, 1771, 4, 3, 1578, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 2955, 447, 3, 1187, 1, 21930, 14, 4, 2955, 343, 2280, 328, 21930, 14, 138, 4, 1565, 68, 40, 52664, 6, 2955, 2297, 673, 4, 26, 45, 21, 275, 3, 1710, 1, 37, 2105, 5447, 21930, 14, 2558, 9, 3, 2955, 314, 308, 75, 13747, 35, 3988, 3393, 1, 2682, 2955, 15, 8, 2818, 544, 2955, 3883, 5858, 2955, 21, 509, 17, 3, 686, 1, 30, 285, 5, 2280, 328, 2945, 4, 21930, 14, 11, 745, 6, 2955, 517, 31, 417, 1854, 20, 748, 37058, 134, 37, 11, 436, 6, 55, 1, 13747, 2, 5858, 2955, 65, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 6166, 4, 3, 338, 30, 285, 553, 17, 37058, 32, 1971, 9, 21930, 14, 2, 211, 7907, 10520, 547, 2955, 745, 31, 285, 3532, 10520, 55, 1813, 3, 2955, 436, 27831, 2, 37059, 31, 285, 11, 120, 1971, 9, 110, 21930, 14, 10520, 14721, 1, 361, 21930, 14, 15, 10520, 237, 37058, 15, 37059, 37, 4138, 2955, 517, 314, 6, 1226, 8, 6, 708, 31, 417, 1854, 925, 5, 26, 7084, 200, 21, 164, 17, 10520, 359, 120, 3279, 55, 1, 3035, 21, 120, 509, 17, 407, 1, 46, 1793, 4983, 5071, 6166, 8080, 27831, 37, 436, 6, 363, 1, 3, 2955, 308, 20, 3, 1573, 420, 540, 1192, 14721, 1, 361, 21930, 14, 15, 10520, 237, 27831, 37, 4138, 3, 540, 261, 1350, 986, 1162, 46, 74, 608, 17, 10520, 122, 13748, 9, 21930, 14, 407, 22, 17594, 6, 2955, 485]",1568.0,11719516,Compensation BRG-1 function Brm insight role core SWI-SNF subunits retinoblastoma suppressor signaling,0,0.0
Primary colorectal tumour is not an accurate predictor of thymidylate synthase in lymph node metastasis.,Oncology reports,Oncol. Rep.,,"Analysis of tumour markers is helping to predict individual patient response to chemotherapy. However, the difficulties in obtaining metastatic disease samples has led to a reliance on assessment of primary tumour, with little data on its predictive ability. This study assessed thymidylate synthase (TS), a target for the commonly used drug 5FU, in 42 paired primary colorectal tumour and lymph node metastasis. High TS staining was seen in 63% of primary colon tumour cells and 81% of the secondary lymph node. Primary tumour did not have significant predictive power for secondary tumour samples (kappa=0.125; p=0.38). There was no significant relationship between TS staining and expression of G1/S cell cycle proteins p21, p27, p53, cyclin D1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (p>0.05 in all cases).

"Delayed diagnosis of retinoblastoma: analysis of degree, cause, and potential consequences.",Pediatrics,Pediatrics,2002-03-01,"To assess the degree, cause, and consequence of delays from presenting signs to diagnosis of retinoblastoma. A retrospective chart review was conducted of 64 consecutive patients who presented to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with newly diagnosed retinoblastoma. Seven patients with a positive family history were excluded. The median times from presenting signs to diagnosis for patients with unilateral and bilateral disease were 1.5 and 2.25 months (range: 0--46), respectively; for those who presented with leukocoria and strabismus, median times were 1.5 (range: 0--46) and 2.5 months (range: 0--24). Parents noted the first signs in 75% of the cases. Seventy-seven percent delayed seeking treatment, and primary care physicians (PCPs) delayed referral in 30%. Only 3 patients were referred from PCPs solely for physical examination findings. No adverse consequence of delayed diagnosis could be established clearly, but a trend toward eye loss being associated with longer delays in patients with bilateral retinoblastoma was noted. Leukocoria and strabismus secondary to retinoblastoma are usually first recognized by relatives rather than PCPs. At routine visits, PCPs should inform parents about the importance of reporting eye abnormalities, and children whose parents complain of leukocoria (white, shiny, jello-like eye) should be referred promptly to an ophthalmologist regardless of whether an absent red reflex is appreciated.",Journal Article,6535.0,55.0,assess degree cause consequence delays presenting signs diagnosis retinoblastoma retrospective chart review conducted 64 consecutive patients presented Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center newly diagnosed retinoblastoma Seven patients positive family history excluded median times presenting signs diagnosis patients unilateral bilateral disease 1.5 2.25 months range 0 -- 46 respectively presented leukocoria strabismus median times 1.5 range 0 -- 46 2.5 months range 0 -- 24 Parents noted signs 75 cases Seventy-seven percent delayed seeking treatment primary care physicians PCPs delayed referral 30 3 patients referred PCPs solely physical examination findings adverse consequence delayed diagnosis established clearly trend eye loss associated longer delays patients bilateral retinoblastoma noted Leukocoria strabismus secondary retinoblastoma usually recognized relatives PCPs routine visits PCPs inform parents importance reporting eye abnormalities children parents complain leukocoria white shiny jello-like eye referred promptly ophthalmologist regardless absent red reflex appreciated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 423, 3, 1444, 708, 2, 4177, 1, 3257, 29, 1656, 3408, 6, 147, 1, 8, 459, 2937, 206, 10, 426, 1, 660, 935, 7, 54, 917, 6, 3, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 5, 732, 265, 648, 7, 5, 8, 109, 607, 532, 11, 1800, 3, 52, 1072, 29, 1656, 3408, 6, 147, 9, 7, 5, 3208, 2, 1607, 34, 11, 14, 33, 2, 18, 243, 53, 184, 13, 641, 106, 9, 135, 54, 917, 5, 33191, 2, 19430, 52, 1072, 11, 14, 33, 184, 13, 641, 2, 18, 33, 53, 184, 13, 259, 2418, 1051, 3, 157, 3408, 4, 481, 1, 3, 140, 2073, 648, 714, 1612, 5734, 24, 2, 86, 165, 1261, 8640, 1612, 2096, 4, 201, 158, 27, 7, 11, 1995, 29, 8640, 5558, 9, 900, 1385, 272, 77, 290, 4177, 1, 1612, 147, 359, 40, 635, 2536, 84, 8, 853, 1317, 4922, 407, 486, 41, 5, 589, 3257, 4, 7, 5, 1607, 10, 1051, 33191, 2, 19430, 568, 6, 32, 2082, 157, 1904, 20, 3335, 1832, 76, 8640, 28, 1311, 2690, 8640, 257, 2295, 2418, 545, 3, 1187, 1, 1760, 4922, 1171, 2, 541, 1310, 2418, 27856, 1, 33191, 886, 42860, 52767, 733, 4922, 257, 40, 1995, 11396, 6, 35, 42861, 1583, 1, 317, 35, 3269, 3422, 10265, 16, 7292]",1364.0,11875173,Delayed diagnosis retinoblastoma degree cause potential consequences,0,0.0
Analysis of key cell-cycle checkpoint proteins in colorectal tumours.,The Journal of pathology,J. Pathol.,2002-04-01,"Aberrations in the components of cell-cycle checkpoints are a common feature of many tumours and several have been shown to have prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. In this study, seven components of cell-cycle control [cyclin D1, retinoblastoma (pRb), p21, p27, p16, p53, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] were examined in a large series of well-characterized colorectal adenocarcinomas using immunohistochemistry to ascertain co-regulation and influence on survival. The majority (92%) of the tumours had abnormal staining of > or =2 cell-cycle control factors. Expression of cyclin D1 protein was correlated with both p21 (p<0.001) and p27 (p=0.033), suggesting co-regulation of these proteins in colorectal tumours. Only cyclin D1 (p=0.048) and p53 (p=0.025) were directly associated with PCNA levels, suggesting a more important role in the proliferative capacity of tumour cells. Significant associations between cell cycle-related proteins and clinicopathological data were observed: cyclin D1 and p53 proteins were correlated with patient age (p=0.042 and p<0.001, respectively) and p53 (p=0.01) and p21 (p=0.024) proteins were associated with tumour site. Expression of cyclin D1 protein was the only protein examined that was related to improved outcome in these patients (p=0.0266), but it was not an independent predictor of survival.

Activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of Rb are associated with p16-mediated apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2002-03-01,"The p16 tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human cancer tissues and cell lines. We previously reported that wild-type p16 expression from an adenovirus vector (Adv/p16) induced p53-dependent apoptotic cell death in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Here we show the potential mechanism of apoptosis induced by Adv/p16 infection. Infection of human NSCLC cell line A549, which carries the wild-type p53 gene, with Adv/p16 resulted in activation of caspase-3, accompanied by the cleavage of its substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), on day 3 of infection. The retinoblastoma (Rb) cell cycle regulator protein was also cleaved after activation of caspase-3; when the levels of Rb significantly diminished, apoptosis began. When A549 cells were pretreated with the caspase-inhibitory peptide N-acetyl-asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (aldehyde) (Ac-DEVD-CHO), Adv/p16-mediated apoptosis and Rb cleavage were greatly inhibited.

Ocular preservation after 36 Gy external beam radiation therapy for retinoblastoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2002-05-01,"The purpose of this study was to document the ocular preservation rate after 36 Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for retinoblastoma. Forty-nine eyes of 38 patients were treated with a median dose of 36 Gy EBRT. The patient population included 7 unilateral and 31 bilateral presentations, with a median age at diagnosis of 4 months. Eyes enucleated at the time of diagnosis or treated with other measures were not included in the analysis of ocular preservation. The median age at EBRT was 8 months. Patients were monitored for progression of disease after EBRT and second malignant neoplasms. The median follow-up was 88.6 months, with an estimated ocular preservation rate of 82.0% +/- 5% at 10 years. There was a difference in the ocular preservation rates for patients with advanced disease (Reese-Ellsworth group III-V) compared with early disease. Metastatic disease developed in two patients, and a second malignant neoplasm developed in three. Patients treated with en face electrons experienced a lower 5-year estimate of ocular preservation than those treated with photons, although patients treated with electrons were more likely to have advanced disease. The use of low-dose EBRT (36 Gy) results in ocular preservation rates that are comparable to those of high-dose EBRT.

Oncol.,2002-02-01,"Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) is a serious disorder seen in various states of immunodeficiency, often with a fatal outcome. In this article, a patient with EBV-lymphoma after autologous stem cell rescue for treatment of a nonhematologic solid tumor is described. The child, a 4-year-old boy, had unilateral retinoblastoma with metastatic spread to the central nervous system. He had previously received both local tumor bed and craniospinal radiation therapy together with intensive myeloablative alkylator chemotherapy before autologous stem cell rescue. Histologically confirmed lymphoma with evidence of active EBV proliferation developed within cervical lymph nodes 3 weeks after his first autologous stem cell rescue. A complete clinical remission of the lymphadenopathy was obtained after infusions of rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), acyclovir, and high-titer anticytomegalovirus immunoglobulin.

17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin induces the degradation of androgen receptor and HER-2/neu and inhibits the growth of prostate cancer xenografts.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-05-01,"Ansamycin antibiotics, including 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), inhibit Hsp90 function and cause the selective degradation of signaling proteins that require this chaperone for folding. Because mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) and activation of HER2 and Akt may account, in part, for prostate cancer progression after castration or treatment with antiandrogens, we sought to determine whether an inhibitor of Hsp90 function could degrade these Hsp90 client proteins and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer xenografts with an acceptable therapeutic index. The effect of 17-AAG on the expression of Hsp90 regulated signaling proteins in prostate cancer cells and xenografts was determined. The pharmacodynamics of target protein degradation was associated with the toxicology and antitumor activity of the drug. 17-AAG caused the degradation of HER2, Akt, and both mutant and wild-type AR and the retinoblastoma-dependent G1 growth arrest of prostate cancer cells. At nontoxic doses, 17-AAG caused a dose-dependent decline in AR, HER2, and Akt expression in prostate cancer xenografts. This decline was rapid, with a 97% loss of HER2 and an 80% loss of AR expression at 4 h. 17-AAG treatment at doses sufficient to induce AR, HER2, and Akt degradation resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer xenograft growth without toxicity. These data demonstrate that, at a tolerable dose, inhibition of Hsp90 function by 17-AAG results in a marked reduction in HER2, AR, and Akt expression and inhibition of prostate tumor growth in mice. These results suggest that this drug may represent a new strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer.",Journal Article,6474.0,408.0,Ansamycin antibiotics including 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin 17-AAG inhibit Hsp90 function cause selective degradation signaling require chaperone folding androgen receptor AR activation HER2 Akt account prostate progression castration treatment antiandrogens sought determine inhibitor Hsp90 function degrade Hsp90 client inhibit growth prostate xenografts acceptable therapeutic index effect 17-AAG expression Hsp90 regulated signaling prostate xenografts determined pharmacodynamics target degradation associated toxicology antitumor activity drug 17-AAG caused degradation HER2 Akt wild-type AR retinoblastoma-dependent G1 growth arrest prostate nontoxic doses 17-AAG caused dose-dependent decline AR HER2 Akt expression prostate xenografts decline rapid 97 loss HER2 80 loss AR expression 4 h. 17-AAG treatment doses sufficient induce AR HER2 Akt degradation resulted dose-dependent inhibition androgen-dependent -independent prostate xenograft growth toxicity demonstrate tolerable dose inhibition Hsp90 function 17-AAG marked reduction HER2 AR Akt expression inhibition prostate growth mice suggest drug represent new strategy treatment prostate,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21944, 5214, 141, 52891, 269, 10051, 269, 4513, 1433, 2515, 343, 2, 708, 3, 1094, 2373, 1, 314, 652, 17, 1353, 26, 7255, 9, 12992, 408, 138, 4, 3, 687, 153, 754, 2, 363, 1, 354, 2, 649, 68, 1967, 4, 760, 9, 12, 91, 50, 1517, 15, 24, 5, 9627, 21, 990, 6, 223, 317, 35, 230, 1, 2515, 343, 359, 16641, 46, 2515, 7304, 652, 2, 1433, 3, 129, 1, 12, 1348, 5, 35, 1595, 189, 558, 3, 254, 1, 269, 4513, 23, 3, 55, 1, 2515, 1065, 314, 652, 4, 12, 37, 2, 1348, 10, 509, 3, 3587, 1, 283, 178, 2373, 10, 41, 5, 3, 18174, 2, 579, 128, 1, 3, 234, 269, 4513, 1546, 3, 2373, 1, 354, 649, 2, 110, 620, 2, 955, 267, 754, 2, 3, 18175, 470, 3344, 129, 1854, 1, 12, 37, 28, 10535, 415, 269, 4513, 1546, 8, 61, 470, 1858, 4, 754, 354, 2, 649, 55, 4, 12, 1348, 26, 1858, 10, 1321, 5, 8, 1015, 407, 1, 354, 2, 35, 493, 407, 1, 754, 55, 28, 39, 555, 269, 4513, 24, 28, 415, 1952, 6, 1290, 754, 354, 2, 649, 2373, 627, 4, 3, 61, 470, 297, 1, 687, 470, 2, 306, 12, 1330, 129, 187, 155, 46, 74, 608, 17, 28, 8, 2668, 61, 297, 1, 2515, 343, 20, 269, 4513, 99, 4, 8, 2003, 628, 4, 354, 754, 2, 649, 55, 2, 297, 1, 30, 129, 4, 399, 46, 99, 309, 17, 26, 234, 68, 1231, 8, 217, 692, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1607.0,12006510,17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin induces degradation androgen receptor HER-2/neu inhibits growth prostate xenografts,0,0.0
Second malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-10-01,"The authors investigated the incidence and relative risk of secondary malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma. A comprehensive list of 509 patients with primary osteosarcoma treated at our institution between February 1973 and March 2000 was identified. All study patients received chemotherapy and/or surgery on one of six different protocols (T4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and CCG-7921/POG-9351). Chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 40 weeks with some variations in the actual treatment period and consisted of various combinations of the following agents: high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) occurred in 14 of 509 patients. Only one had pulmonary metastasis at diagnosis and subsequent multiple recurrences that required thoracotomies and further modification of the chemotherapy regimen. The median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma was 16.6 years (range, 3.1-74.4 years). The median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0.1-25.0 years). The time interval from diagnosis of the primary osteosarcoma to the development of SMN was 1.3-13.1 years (median, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-9.6). The most common SMN occurred in the central nervous system (n = 4): anaplastic glioma, meningioma, high-grade glioma, and maxillary astrocytoma. There were two cases of acute myeloid leukemia and one case each of myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, breast carcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The overall 5 and 10-year cumulative incidences of SMNs were 1.4% +/- 1.1% and 3.1% +/- 1.8%. The standardized incidence ratio was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.53-7.78, P = 0.00001) for the cohort and 3.64 (95% CI, 1.82-6.52, P = 0.0007) when patients with a history of retinoblastoma or Rothmund-Thomson syndrome were excluded.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol disrupts sodium butyrate-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and maturation while reciprocally potentiating apoptosis in human leukemia cells.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2002-02-01,"Interactions between the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (FP) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) have been examined in human leukemia cells (U937) in relation to differentiation and apoptosis. Whereas 1 mM of SB or 100 nM of FP minimally induced apoptosis (4% and 10%, respectively) at 24 h, simultaneous exposure of U937 cells to these agents dramatically increased cell death (e.g., approximately 60%), reflected by both morphological and Annexin/propidium iodide-staining features, procaspase 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Similar interactions were observed in human promyelocytic (HL-60), B-lymphoblastic (Raji), and T-lymphoblastic (Jurkat) leukemia cells. Coadministration of FP opposed SB-mediated accumulation of cells in G0G1 and differentiation, reflected by reduced CD11b expression, but instead dramatically increased procaspase-3, procaspase-8, Bid, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, as well as mitochondrial damage (e.g., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release). FP also blocked SB-related p21WAF1-CIP1 induction through a caspase-independent mechanism and triggered the caspase-mediated cleavage of p27KIP1 and retinoblastoma protein. The latter event was accompanied by a marked reduction in retinoblastoma protein/E2F1 complex formation. However, FP did not modify the extent of SB-associated acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Treatment of cells with FP/SB also resulted in the caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 and caspase-independent down-regulation of Mcl-1. Levels of cyclins A, D1, and E, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis also declined in SB/FP-treated cells. Finally, FP/SB coexposure potently induced apoptosis in two primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples. Together, these findings demonstrate that FP, when combined with SB, induces multiple perturbations in cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, which oppose leukemic cell differentiation but instead promote mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.",Journal Article,6563.0,68.0,Interactions cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol FP histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate SB examined human leukemia U937 relation differentiation apoptosis 1 mM SB 100 nM FP minimally induced apoptosis 4 10 respectively 24 h simultaneous exposure U937 agents dramatically increased death e.g. approximately 60 reflected morphological Annexin/propidium iodide-staining features procaspase 3 activation poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage Similar interactions observed human promyelocytic HL-60 B-lymphoblastic Raji T-lymphoblastic Jurkat leukemia Coadministration FP opposed SB-mediated accumulation G0G1 differentiation reflected reduced CD11b expression instead dramatically increased procaspase-3 procaspase-8 Bid poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage mitochondrial damage e.g. loss mitochondrial membrane potential cytochrome c release FP blocked SB-related p21WAF1-CIP1 induction caspase-independent mechanism triggered caspase-mediated cleavage p27KIP1 retinoblastoma event accompanied marked reduction retinoblastoma protein/E2F1 complex formation FP modify extent SB-associated acetylation histones H3 H4 Treatment FP/SB resulted caspase-mediated cleavage Bcl-2 caspase-independent down-regulation Mcl-1 Levels cyclins D1 E X-linked inhibitor apoptosis declined SB/FP-treated Finally FP/SB coexposure potently induced apoptosis primary acute myelogenous leukemia findings demonstrate FP combined SB induces multiple perturbations cycle apoptosis regulatory oppose leukemic differentiation instead promote mitochondrial damage apoptosis,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 3030, 6434, 2, 3, 1508, 2732, 230, 4682, 12285, 5343, 47, 85, 409, 4, 171, 37, 7000, 4, 2191, 6, 910, 2, 351, 547, 14, 321, 1, 5343, 15, 394, 2878, 1, 6434, 2144, 277, 351, 39, 2, 79, 106, 28, 259, 555, 2824, 645, 1, 7000, 37, 6, 46, 183, 2729, 101, 31, 273, 563, 499, 705, 335, 4686, 20, 110, 4268, 2, 4850, 10839, 8456, 1029, 404, 10153, 27, 363, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 288, 1286, 11, 164, 4, 171, 4300, 1718, 335, 132, 1275, 9868, 2, 102, 1275, 8433, 37, 5777, 1, 6434, 6101, 5343, 517, 1835, 1, 37, 4, 53278, 2, 910, 4686, 20, 405, 6861, 55, 84, 3496, 2729, 101, 10153, 27, 10153, 66, 2793, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 22, 149, 22, 2019, 1350, 563, 499, 407, 1, 2019, 1905, 174, 2, 4155, 256, 2008, 6434, 120, 2582, 5343, 139, 18838, 6927, 504, 298, 8, 1469, 306, 670, 2, 4173, 3, 1469, 517, 3155, 1, 11581, 2, 178, 3, 3286, 774, 10, 2756, 20, 8, 2003, 628, 4, 178, 6112, 840, 1264, 137, 6434, 205, 44, 4289, 3, 1039, 1, 5343, 41, 4145, 1, 8457, 3739, 2, 7812, 24, 1, 37, 5, 6434, 5343, 120, 627, 4, 3, 1469, 517, 3155, 1, 1044, 18, 2, 1469, 306, 1328, 863, 1, 1308, 14, 148, 1, 10149, 8, 2146, 2, 563, 2, 1006, 1199, 230, 1, 351, 120, 3054, 4, 5343, 6434, 73, 37, 1368, 6434, 5343, 21094, 4684, 277, 351, 4, 100, 86, 286, 2194, 347, 1162, 46, 272, 608, 17, 6434, 198, 397, 5, 5343, 1516, 232, 7013, 4, 31, 417, 2, 351, 1253, 652, 92, 26089, 2015, 31, 910, 84, 3496, 1617, 2019, 1350, 2, 351]",1923.0,12467221,cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol disrupts sodium butyrate-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression maturation reciprocally potentiating apoptosis human leukemia,8,0.041237113402061855
ID2 expression is not associated with MYCN amplification or expression in human neuroblastomas.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-04-01,"MYCN is a biologically and clinically important oncogene in human neuroblastoma as genomic amplification reliably predicts for aggressive tumor behavior and a poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which MYCN amplification and overexpression contributes to a highly malignant phenotype remains obscure. ID2 is a dominant inhibitor of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene product and recently was suggested to be a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. Overexpression of Id2 protein has thus been postulated to result in functional inactivation of retinoblastoma in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, offering a potential explanation for the undifferentiated and highly proliferative nature of most MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas, as well as the paucity of retinoblastoma pathway mutations observed in clinical samples. We therefore sought to determine the likelihood that ID2 overexpression is associated with MYCN amplification and overexpression in human neuroblastoma. ID2 was not differentially expressed in 39 primary neuroblastoma specimens analyzed by oligonucleotide array-based expression analysis, and there was no correlation with MYCN expression levels. ID2 mRNA and protein expression was highly variable and independent of MYCN amplification status and mRNA expression in 10 human-derived neuroblastoma cell lines. In addition, ID2 mRNA expression was not associated with MYCN gene amplification status (P = 0.15) or MYCN expression (r = 0.22) in 131 separate diagnostic primary neuroblastoma samples analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation of ID2 by the MycN oncoprotein is unlikely to be a seminal molecular event resulting in a highly malignant neuroblastoma phenotype.",Journal Article,6139.0,23.0,MYCN biologically clinically important oncogene human neuroblastoma genomic amplification reliably predicts aggressive behavior poor prognosis mechanism MYCN amplification overexpression contributes highly malignant phenotype remains obscure ID2 dominant inhibitor RB1 suppressor product recently suggested direct transcriptional target MYCN Overexpression Id2 postulated functional inactivation retinoblastoma MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas offering potential explanation undifferentiated highly proliferative nature MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas paucity retinoblastoma pathway observed clinical sought determine likelihood ID2 overexpression associated MYCN amplification overexpression human neuroblastoma ID2 differentially expressed 39 primary neuroblastoma specimens oligonucleotide array-based expression correlation MYCN expression levels ID2 mRNA expression highly variable independent MYCN amplification status mRNA expression 10 human-derived neuroblastoma lines addition ID2 mRNA expression associated MYCN amplification status P 0.15 MYCN expression r 0.22 131 separate diagnostic primary neuroblastoma real-time quantitative RT-PCR suggest transcriptional regulation ID2 MycN oncoprotein unlikely seminal molecular event resulting highly malignant neuroblastoma phenotype,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4068, 16, 8, 2665, 2, 505, 305, 1836, 4, 171, 22, 572, 1073, 4092, 2623, 9, 571, 30, 1710, 2, 8, 334, 356, 137, 3, 670, 20, 92, 4068, 1073, 2, 851, 2444, 6, 8, 561, 393, 1005, 469, 12323, 13296, 16, 8, 2156, 230, 1, 3, 4596, 30, 1245, 145, 2821, 2, 761, 10, 1148, 6, 40, 8, 1196, 1431, 283, 1, 4068, 851, 1, 13296, 178, 71, 631, 85, 6507, 6, 757, 4, 583, 2297, 1, 4, 4068, 2429, 8915, 5846, 8, 174, 6603, 9, 3, 4480, 2, 561, 2441, 2202, 1, 96, 4068, 2429, 8915, 22, 149, 22, 3, 4832, 1, 308, 138, 164, 4, 38, 347, 21, 673, 990, 6, 223, 3, 1420, 17, 13296, 851, 16, 41, 5, 4068, 1073, 2, 851, 4, 171, 13296, 10, 44, 2478, 570, 4, 587, 86, 623, 311, 20, 4727, 1926, 90, 55, 65, 2, 125, 10, 77, 816, 5, 4068, 55, 148, 13296, 956, 2, 178, 55, 10, 561, 1347, 2, 306, 1, 4068, 1073, 156, 2, 956, 55, 4, 79, 171, 526, 31, 285, 4, 352, 13296, 956, 55, 10, 44, 41, 5, 4068, 145, 1073, 156, 19, 13, 167, 15, 4068, 55, 668, 13, 350, 4, 2229, 2282, 752, 86, 347, 311, 20, 1589, 98, 1156, 240, 604, 46, 74, 309, 17, 1431, 863, 1, 13296, 20, 3, 4068, 6159, 16, 3568, 6, 40, 8, 4786, 219, 774, 1113, 4, 8, 561, 393, 1005]",1596.0,12670915,ID2 expression associated MYCN amplification expression human neuroblastomas,0,0.0
The lethal effects of pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors in human leukemia cells proceed through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent process.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-04-01,"The impact of disruption of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway on the response of human leukemia cells to pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors has been examined. Exposure of U937 monocytic leukemia cells to minimally toxic concentrations of flavopiridol (FP), roscovitine, or CGP74514A for 3 h in conjunction with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (abbreviated LY in the article) resulted in a marked decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Coexposure of cells to LY and CDK inhibitors also resulted in an early (i.e., within 3 h) and striking increase in mitochondrial damage [e.g., cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO), and apoptosis-initiating factor (AIF) release], caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were observed in a variety of other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, Raji, and NB4). Apoptosis, induced by FP/LY, was substantially blocked by ectopic expression of Bcl-2, but to a considerably lesser extent by dominant-negative caspase-8. FP-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by agents that inhibited protein kinase (PK) A (H89), PKC (GFX), mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK1/2; U0126), p38 MAP kinase (MAPK; SB202190), m-target of rapamycin (TOR; rapamycin), or ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM; caffeine), whereas the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin exerted effects similar to those of LY. The dramatic potentiation of CDK inhibitor-induced apoptosis by LY was accompanied by diminished Bad phosphorylation, induction of Bcl-2 cleavage, and down-regulation of X-linked IAP (XIAP) and Mcl-1. Cells exposed to CDK inhibitors + LY also exhibited reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), p70(S6K), and ERK, but increased activation of p34(cdc2) and p38 MAPK. LY/CDK inhibitor-treated cells also displayed diminished pRb dephosphorylation on CDK2- and CDK4-specific sites, retinoblastoma protein cleavage, and down-regulation of cyclin D(1).

Histone deacetylase inhibitors promote STI571-mediated apoptosis in STI571-sensitive and -resistant Bcr/Abl+ human myeloid leukemia cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-05-01,"Interactions between the Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec, imatinib mesylate) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) have been examined in STI571-sensitive and -resistant Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells (K562 and LAMA 84). Cotreatment of K562 cells with 250 nM imatinib mesylate and 2.0 micro M suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for 24 h, exposures that were minimally toxic alone, resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (e.g., cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor release), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar events were observed in other Bcr/Abl(+) cells (i.e., LAMA 84), and in cells exposed to STI571 in combination with the HDI sodium butyrate. Coexposure of cells to HDIs in conjunction with STI571 resulted in multiple perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, including down-regulation of Raf, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospho-Akt, phospho-signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, cyclin D1, and Mcl-1, accompanied by dephosphorylation and cleavage of retinoblastoma protein and a striking increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Coexposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to STI571 also blocked SAHA-mediated induction of p21(CIP1) and resulted in down-regulation of Bcr/Abl protein expression. STI571 and SAHA also interacted synergistically to induce apoptosis in STI571-resistant K562 and LAMA 84 cells that display increased Bcr/Abl protein expression. Lastly, inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1/2 construct significantly attenuated SAHA/STI571-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, implicating disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis in synergistic antileukemic effects of this drug combination. Together, these findings indicate that combined exposure of Bcr/Abl(+) cells to the kinase inhibitor STI571 and HDIs leads to diverse perturbations in signaling and cell cycle-regulatory proteins, associated with a marked increase in mitochondrial damage and cell death. They also raise the possibility that this strategy may be effective in some Bcr/Abl(+) cells that are resistant to STI571 through increased Bcr/Abl expression.",Journal Article,6109.0,126.0,Interactions Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 Gleevec imatinib mesylate histone deacetylase inhibitors HDIs examined STI571-sensitive -resistant Bcr/Abl human leukemia K562 LAMA 84 Cotreatment K562 250 nM imatinib mesylate 2.0 micro suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA 24 h exposures minimally toxic resulted marked increase mitochondrial damage e.g. cytochrome c Smac/DIABLO apoptosis-inducing factor release caspase activation apoptosis Similar events observed Bcr/Abl i.e. LAMA 84 exposed STI571 combination HDI sodium butyrate Coexposure HDIs conjunction STI571 resulted multiple perturbations signaling cycle-regulatory including down-regulation Raf phospho-mitogen-activated kinase kinase MEK phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK phospho-Akt phospho-signal transducers activators transcription 5 cyclin D1 Mcl-1 accompanied dephosphorylation cleavage retinoblastoma striking increase phosphorylation c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase Coexposure Bcr/Abl STI571 blocked SAHA-mediated induction p21 CIP1 resulted down-regulation Bcr/Abl expression STI571 SAHA interacted synergistically induce apoptosis STI571-resistant K562 LAMA 84 display increased Bcr/Abl expression Lastly inducible expression constitutively active MEK1/2 construct significantly attenuated SAHA/STI571-mediated apoptosis K562 implicating disruption Raf/MEK/ERK axis synergistic antileukemic effects drug combination findings indicate combined exposure Bcr/Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 HDIs leads diverse perturbations signaling cycle-regulatory associated marked increase mitochondrial damage death raise possibility strategy effective Bcr/Abl resistant STI571 increased Bcr/Abl expression,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 1062, 1425, 216, 230, 5735, 8569, 577, 2347, 2, 1508, 2732, 222, 14178, 47, 85, 409, 4, 5735, 745, 2, 436, 1062, 1425, 171, 37, 5208, 2, 21071, 874, 10066, 1, 5208, 37, 5, 2039, 2878, 577, 2347, 2, 18, 13, 4659, 188, 9258, 8856, 971, 5484, 9, 259, 555, 3401, 17, 11, 2144, 1812, 279, 627, 4, 8, 2003, 344, 4, 2019, 1350, 563, 499, 4155, 256, 9251, 14415, 2, 351, 1958, 161, 2008, 1469, 363, 2, 351, 288, 281, 11, 164, 4, 127, 1062, 1425, 37, 70, 563, 21071, 874, 2, 4, 37, 2234, 6, 5735, 4, 150, 5, 3, 6676, 4682, 12285, 21094, 1, 37, 6, 14178, 4, 3357, 5, 5735, 627, 4, 232, 7013, 4, 314, 2, 31, 417, 1253, 652, 141, 1328, 863, 1, 2212, 3125, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 216, 1693, 3125, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 1819, 3125, 649, 3125, 1235, 11439, 2, 7751, 1, 866, 33, 1226, 2146, 2, 1308, 14, 2756, 20, 7849, 2, 3155, 1, 178, 2, 8, 5133, 344, 4, 982, 1, 256, 4578, 6260, 18, 2158, 216, 21094, 1, 1062, 1425, 37, 6, 5735, 120, 2582, 5484, 517, 504, 1, 2657, 6927, 2, 627, 4, 1328, 863, 1, 1062, 1425, 178, 55, 5735, 2, 5484, 120, 7940, 4240, 6, 1290, 351, 4, 5735, 436, 5208, 2, 21071, 874, 37, 17, 3640, 101, 1062, 1425, 178, 55, 6354, 2877, 55, 1, 8, 2818, 544, 3893, 18, 3883, 97, 2656, 5484, 5735, 517, 351, 4, 5208, 37, 7912, 3220, 1, 3, 2212, 1693, 1819, 2310, 4, 1806, 4512, 176, 1, 26, 234, 150, 1162, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 397, 645, 1, 1062, 1425, 37, 6, 3, 216, 230, 5735, 2, 14178, 1940, 6, 1867, 7013, 4, 314, 2, 31, 417, 1253, 652, 41, 5, 8, 2003, 344, 4, 2019, 1350, 2, 31, 273, 491, 120, 5008, 3, 2526, 17, 26, 692, 68, 40, 323, 4, 476, 1062, 1425, 37, 17, 32, 436, 6, 5735, 298, 101, 1062, 1425, 55]",2146.0,12727828,Histone deacetylase inhibitors promote STI571-mediated apoptosis STI571-sensitive -resistant Bcr/Abl+ human myeloid leukemia,0,0.0
Preclinical characterization of the antiglioma activity of a tropism-enhanced adenovirus targeted to the retinoblastoma pathway.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2003-05-01,"Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising therapies for the treatment of gliomas. However, untargeted viral replication and the paucity of coxsackie-adenovirus receptors (CARs) on tumor cells are major stumbling blocks for adenovirus-based treatment. We studied the antiglioma activity of the tumor-selective Delta-24 adenovirus, which encompasses an early 1 A adenoviral (E1A) deletion in the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-binding region, and of the Delta-24-RGD adenovirus. Delta-24-RGD has an RGD-4C peptide motif inserted into the adenoviral fiber, which allows the adenovirus to anchor directly to integrins. CAR and integrin expression were examined by flow cytometry in six glioma cell lines and in normal human astrocytes (NHAs). Adenoviral vectors containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (AdGFP and AdGFP-RGD) were used to infect glioma cell lines with high or low CAR expression. Viability of glioma cells infected with different adenoviruses was assessed by trypan blue staining. Adenovirus replication was quantified with the infection-dose replication assay. Athymic mice carrying glioma xenografts received intratumoral injections of Delta-24-RGD or Delta-24 and were followed for survival, which was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Half the glioma cell lines expressed low levels of CAR (defined as <50% of cells expressing detectable CAR); all lines expressed integrins in more than 50% of cells. Infection of U-87 MG cells (a low-CAR-expressing line) with AdGFP-RGD resulted in approximately six times more GFP-positive cells than infection with AdGFP. Delta-24-RGD was more cytopathic to both low- and high-CAR-expressing glioma lines than Delta-24, and it replicated more efficiently in both cell lines.

Treatment of intraocular retinoblastoma with vincristine and carboplatin.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-05-01,"To evaluate the efficacy of chemoreduction using vincristine and carboplatin in preventing or delaying external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or enucleation in patients with intraocular retinoblastoma. Twenty-five patients (43 eyes) with newly diagnosed intraocular retinoblastoma received primary treatment with eight courses of vincristine and carboplatin. Focal treatments were delayed until documentation of disease progression. Outcome measures for each eye were length of time to disease progression, avoidance or delay of EBRT, and globe survival. Event-free survival was defined as the length of time to EBRT or enucleation. Disease in all eyes responded to chemotherapy and progressed in only two patients before completion of the eight courses of therapy. Disease in all but four eyes progressed and required focal treatments. Event-free survival estimates at 2 years were 59.2% +/- 12.0% for Reese-Ellsworth group I, II, and III eyes and 26.3% +/- 9.2% for group IV and V eyes. Nineteen eyes (44.2%) required EBRT and 13 eyes (30.2%) were enucleated. The ocular salvage rate was 83.3% for Reese-Ellsworth group I to III eyes and 52.6% for group IV and V eyes. For those patients receiving EBRT, the median time from enrollment to EBRT was 9.5 months (median age at EBRT, 21 months). In combination with appropriate early intensive focal treatments, chemoreduction with vincristine and carboplatin, without etoposide, may be an alternative treatment for patients with early-stage intraocular retinoblastoma, although additional studies are needed.

The histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 promotes differentiation or apoptosis in human leukemia cells through a process regulated by generation of reactive oxygen species and induction of p21CIP1/WAF1 1.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-07-01,"Effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MS-275 have been examined in human leukemia and lymphoma cells (U937, HL-60, K562, and Jurkat) as well as in primary acute myelogenous leukemia blasts in relation to differentiation and apoptosis. MS-275 displayed dose-dependent effects in each of the cell lines. When administered at a low concentration (e.g., 1 micro M), MS-275 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity, inducing p21(CIP1/WAF1)-mediated growth arrest and expression of differentiation markers (CD11b) in U937 cells. These events were accompanied by an increase in hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein and down-regulation of cell cycle-related proteins including cyclin D1. However, at higher concentrations (e.g., 5 micro M), MS-275 potently induced cell death, triggering apoptosis in approximately 70% of cells at 48 h. In contrast to other HDAC inhibitors such as apicidin, the extrinsic, receptor-mediated pathway played a minimal role in MS-275 lethality. However, MS-275 potently induced a very early (e.g., within 2 h) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)) and cytosolic release of cytochrome c. These events culminated in activation of the caspase cascade, manifested by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p21(CIP1/WAF1), p27(KIP), Bcl-2, and retinoblastoma protein degradation. MS-275 exposure also resulted in diminished expression of cyclin D1 and the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP. Administration of the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine blocked MS-275-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, suggesting a primary role for ROS generation in MS-275-associated lethality.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib interacts synergistically with histone deacetylase inhibitors to induce apoptosis in Bcr/Abl+ cells sensitive and resistant to STI571.,Blood,Blood,2003-07-31,"Interactions between the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) have been examined in Bcr/Abl+ human leukemia cells (K562 and LAMA 84). Coexposure of cells (24-48 hours) to minimally toxic concentrations of bortezomib + either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or sodium butyrate (SB) resulted in a striking increase in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis, reflected by caspases-3 and -8 cleavage and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation. These events were accompanied by down-regulation of the Raf-1/mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway as well as diminished expression of Bcr/Abl and cyclin D1, cleavage of p21CIP1 and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and induction of the stress-related kinases Jun kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Transient transfection of cells with a constitutively active MEK construct significantly protected them from bortezomib/SAHA-mediated lethality. Coadministration of bortezomib and SAHA resulted in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and diminished nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation; moreover, the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcyteine (LNAC) blocked bortezomib/SAHA-related ROS generation, induction of JNK and p21CIP1, and apoptosis. Lastly, this regimen potently induced apoptosis in STI571 (imatinib mesylate)-resistant K562 cells and CD34+ mononuclear cells obtained from a patient with STI571-resistant disease, as well as in Bcr/Abl- leukemia cells (eg, HL-60, U937, Jurkat).

Flavopiridol-induced apoptosis during S phase requires E2F-1 and inhibition of cyclin A-dependent kinase activity.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-11-01,"Transformed cells are selectively sensitized to apoptosis induced by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol after their recruitment to S phase. During S phase, cyclin A-dependent kinase activity neutralizes E2F-1 allowing orderly S phase progression. Inhibition of cyclin A-dependent kinase by flavopiridol could cause inappropriately persistent E2F-1 activity during S phase traversal and exit. Transformed cells, with high baseline levels of E2F-1 activity, may be particularly sensitive to cyclin A-dependent kinase inhibition, as the residual level of E2F-1 activity that persists may be sufficient to induce apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that flavopiridol treatment during S phase traversal results in persistent expression of E2F-1. The phosphorylation of E2F-1 is markedly diminished, whereas that of the retinoblastoma protein is minimally affected, so that E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimers remain bound to DNA. In addition, manipulation of E2F-1 levels leads to predictable outcomes when cells are exposed to flavopiridol during S phase. Tumor cells expressing high levels of ectopic E2F-1 are more sensitive to flavopiridol-induced apoptosis during S phase compared with parental counterparts, and high levels of ectopic E2F-1 expression are sufficient to sensitize nontransformed cells to flavopiridol. Furthermore, E2F-1 activity is required for flavopiridol-induced apoptosis during S phase, which is severely compromised in cells homozygous for a nonfunctional E2F-1 allele. Finally, the response to flavopiridol during S phase is blunted in cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable E2F-1 mutant incapable of binding cyclin A, suggesting that the modulation of E2F-1 activity produced by flavopiridol-mediated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition is critical for the apoptotic response of S phase cells.",Journal Article,5925.0,40.0,Transformed selectively sensitized apoptosis induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol recruitment phase phase cyclin A-dependent kinase activity neutralizes E2F-1 allowing orderly phase progression Inhibition cyclin A-dependent kinase flavopiridol cause inappropriately persistent E2F-1 activity phase traversal exit Transformed high baseline levels E2F-1 activity particularly sensitive cyclin A-dependent kinase inhibition residual level E2F-1 activity persists sufficient induce apoptosis demonstrate flavopiridol treatment phase traversal persistent expression E2F-1 phosphorylation E2F-1 markedly diminished retinoblastoma minimally affected E2F-1/DP-1 heterodimers remain bound DNA addition manipulation E2F-1 levels leads predictable outcomes exposed flavopiridol phase expressing high levels ectopic E2F-1 sensitive flavopiridol-induced apoptosis phase compared parental counterparts high levels ectopic E2F-1 expression sufficient sensitize nontransformed flavopiridol Furthermore E2F-1 activity required flavopiridol-induced apoptosis phase severely compromised homozygous nonfunctional E2F-1 allele Finally response flavopiridol phase blunted expressing nonphosphorylatable E2F-1 incapable binding cyclin suggesting modulation E2F-1 activity produced flavopiridol-mediated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition critical apoptotic response phase,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2423, 37, 32, 2382, 4242, 6, 351, 277, 20, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 3030, 50, 136, 3202, 6, 695, 124, 190, 695, 124, 1226, 8, 470, 216, 128, 21198, 5391, 14, 2952, 28145, 695, 124, 91, 297, 1, 1226, 8, 470, 216, 20, 3030, 359, 708, 13254, 1882, 5391, 14, 128, 190, 695, 124, 43432, 2, 11909, 2423, 37, 5, 64, 330, 148, 1, 5391, 14, 128, 68, 40, 823, 745, 6, 1226, 8, 470, 216, 297, 22, 3, 753, 301, 1, 5391, 14, 128, 17, 8936, 68, 40, 1952, 6, 1290, 351, 467, 21, 608, 17, 3030, 24, 190, 695, 124, 43432, 99, 4, 1882, 55, 1, 5391, 14, 3, 982, 1, 5391, 14, 16, 2195, 2849, 547, 17, 1, 3, 178, 16, 2144, 1424, 1743, 17, 5391, 14, 6107, 14, 15468, 918, 2951, 6, 261, 4, 352, 6239, 1, 5391, 14, 148, 1940, 6, 7639, 123, 198, 37, 32, 2234, 6, 3030, 190, 695, 124, 30, 37, 1046, 64, 148, 1, 3647, 5391, 14, 32, 80, 745, 6, 3030, 277, 351, 190, 695, 124, 72, 5, 3418, 3953, 2, 64, 148, 1, 3647, 5391, 14, 55, 32, 1952, 6, 5745, 12264, 37, 6, 3030, 798, 5391, 14, 128, 16, 616, 9, 3030, 277, 351, 190, 695, 124, 92, 16, 7207, 4867, 4, 37, 3189, 9, 8, 12260, 5391, 14, 1254, 1368, 3, 51, 6, 3030, 190, 695, 124, 16, 14113, 4, 37, 1046, 8, 33551, 5391, 14, 620, 20290, 1, 791, 1226, 8, 802, 17, 3, 2356, 1, 5391, 14, 128, 1687, 20, 3030, 517, 1226, 470, 216, 297, 16, 740, 9, 3, 1631, 51, 1, 695, 124, 37]",1780.0,14612540,Flavopiridol-induced apoptosis phase requires E2F-1 inhibition cyclin A-dependent kinase activity,0,0.0

The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes. Six patients (35.3%) required I(131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after thyroidectomy. At the time of this report, all 17 patients are alive and in continue to be free of disease. Pediatric thyroid carcinoma is uncommon and responds well to current therapy. Given the limited period of follow-up of our cohort of secondary malignant thyroid tumors that arise after childhood cancer, these lesions appear to have similar presentations and outcomes when compared with primary carcinomas and can therefore be managed in the same manner.",Journal Article,5925.0,60.0,Thyroid carcinomas occur primary malignancy PTM secondary malignancy STM Information presentations outcomes patients STM limited authors sought compare clinical characteristics course outcomes patients primary secondary thyroid malignancies authors reviewed medical records 8 children PTM 17 children STM referred St Jude Children 's Research Hospital February 1962 February 2002 evaluation treatment malignant thyroid carcinoma 8 children primary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed median age 12.5 years range 7.3 16.3 years Seven patients papillary carcinoma 1 patient follicular carcinoma 8 37.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes 2 patients 25.0 lung metastases patients required radioactive iodine 131 ablation residual metastatic disease surgical resection 8 patients remain alive median 22.6 years diagnosis range 0.7 30.5 years 1 continues receive radioactive iodine 131 ablation persistent disease Seventeen patients thyroid carcinoma second malignant neoplasm treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia n 6 Hodgkin 's disease n 5 central nervous n 2 Wilms n 1 retinoblastoma n 1 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma n 1 neuroblastoma n 1 Patients secondary thyroid carcinoma presented median age 21.5 years range 15.3 42.6 years median 16.2 years range 0.9 29.2 years diagnosis primary 17 patients 70.6 received radiation thyroid gland therapy primary patients 23.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes patients 35.3 required 131 ablation residual metastatic disease thyroidectomy time report 17 patients alive continue free disease Pediatric thyroid carcinoma uncommon responds current therapy Given limited period follow-up cohort secondary malignant thyroid arise childhood lesions appear similar presentations outcomes compared primary carcinomas managed manner,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[826, 122, 1271, 22, 8, 86, 710, 23207, 15, 568, 50, 1809, 710, 20338, 487, 545, 3, 4261, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 20338, 32, 383, 3, 738, 990, 6, 932, 3, 38, 374, 906, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 86, 15, 568, 441, 3, 738, 446, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 66, 541, 5, 23207, 2, 269, 541, 5, 20338, 1995, 6, 3062, 4841, 541, 292, 389, 702, 59, 3010, 14754, 2, 3010, 1544, 9, 451, 2, 24, 1, 393, 134, 3, 66, 541, 54, 42, 86, 134, 42, 192, 265, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 133, 33, 60, 184, 67, 27, 6, 245, 27, 60, 648, 7, 42, 1796, 134, 2, 14, 69, 42, 1974, 134, 169, 1, 3, 66, 567, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 18, 7, 243, 13, 42, 196, 437, 7, 616, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 221, 170, 62, 66, 7, 918, 1701, 8, 52, 1, 350, 49, 60, 50, 147, 184, 13, 67, 6, 201, 33, 60, 14, 2274, 6, 560, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 1882, 34, 3591, 7, 42, 134, 22, 8, 419, 393, 2131, 50, 24, 9, 286, 1275, 78, 49, 292, 34, 78, 33, 854, 1880, 398, 30, 78, 18, 30, 78, 14, 78, 14, 292, 78, 14, 15, 78, 14, 7, 5, 568, 134, 917, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 239, 33, 60, 184, 167, 27, 6, 595, 49, 60, 8, 52, 1, 245, 18, 60, 184, 13, 83, 6, 462, 18, 60, 50, 147, 1, 3, 86, 12, 2544, 1, 3, 269, 7, 431, 49, 42, 103, 121, 6, 3, 2326, 190, 36, 9, 3, 86, 12, 294, 7, 382, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 437, 7, 465, 27, 616, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 5949, 28, 3, 98, 1, 26, 414, 62, 269, 7, 32, 1701, 2, 4, 1906, 6, 40, 115, 1, 34, 815, 134, 16, 2052, 2, 7920, 149, 6, 291, 36, 447, 3, 383, 727, 1, 166, 126, 1, 114, 180, 1, 568, 393, 57, 17, 3043, 50, 864, 12, 46, 406, 1322, 6, 47, 288, 4261, 2, 123, 198, 72, 5, 86, 826, 2, 122, 673, 40, 2231, 4, 3, 827, 1708]",2184.0,14614703,Thyroid carcinoma presenting childhood treatment childhood malignancies institutional experience review literature,1,0.005154639175257732
IL-7-dependent human leukemia T-cell line as a valuable tool for drug discovery in T-ALL.,Blood,Blood,2003-11-13,"The specific targeting of critical signaling molecules may provide efficient therapies for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, target identification and drug development are limited by insufficient numbers of primary T-ALL cells and by their high rate of spontaneous apoptosis. We established a human interleukin-7 (IL-7)-dependent T-ALL cell line, TAIL7, that maintains several biologic and signaling properties of its parental leukemia cells. TAIL7 cells are pre-T-ALL cells that proliferate in response to IL-7 and IL-4. IL-7 stimulation of TAIL7 cells prevents spontaneous in vitro apoptosis and induces cell activation and cell cycle progression. The signaling events triggered by IL-7 include down-regulation of p27(kip1) and hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Stimulation of TAIL7 cells by IL-7 leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), Akt/PKB (protein kinase B), and extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2). Importantly, specific blockade of JAK3 by its inhibitor WHI-P131 abrogates the IL-7-mediated proliferation and survival of TAIL7 cells, suggesting that activation of JAK3 is critical for IL-7 responsiveness by these cells. Because TAIL7 cells seem to be a biologic surrogate for primary leukemia T cells, this cell line constitutes a valuable tool for the study of the signaling pathways implicated in T-ALL. Exploitation of this cell line should allow the identification of molecular targets and promote the rational design and validation of antileukemia signaling inhibitors.",Journal Article,5913.0,40.0,specific targeting critical signaling molecules provide efficient therapies T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL target identification drug development limited insufficient numbers primary T-ALL high rate spontaneous apoptosis established human interleukin-7 IL-7 -dependent T-ALL line TAIL7 maintains biologic signaling properties parental leukemia TAIL7 pre-T-ALL proliferate response IL-7 IL-4 IL-7 stimulation TAIL7 prevents spontaneous vitro apoptosis induces activation cycle progression signaling events triggered IL-7 include down-regulation p27 kip1 hyperphosphorylation retinoblastoma Rb Stimulation TAIL7 IL-7 leads phosphorylation Janus kinase 3 JAK3 signal transducer activator transcription 5 STAT5 Akt/PKB kinase B extracellular-regulated kinase 1 2 Erk1/2 Importantly specific blockade JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 abrogates IL-7-mediated proliferation survival TAIL7 suggesting activation JAK3 critical IL-7 responsiveness TAIL7 biologic surrogate primary leukemia line constitutes valuable tool signaling pathways implicated T-ALL Exploitation line allow identification molecular targets promote rational design validation antileukemia signaling inhibitors,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 112, 529, 1, 740, 314, 1598, 68, 377, 2547, 235, 9, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 137, 283, 911, 2, 234, 193, 32, 383, 20, 3027, 1870, 1, 86, 102, 62, 37, 2, 20, 136, 64, 116, 1, 3280, 351, 21, 635, 8, 171, 1603, 67, 501, 67, 470, 102, 62, 31, 328, 28147, 17, 8107, 392, 1283, 2, 314, 1571, 1, 211, 3418, 37, 28147, 37, 32, 671, 102, 62, 37, 17, 9554, 4, 51, 6, 501, 67, 2, 501, 39, 501, 67, 2503, 1, 28147, 37, 5217, 3280, 4, 439, 351, 2, 1516, 31, 363, 2, 31, 417, 91, 3, 314, 281, 4173, 20, 501, 67, 643, 1328, 863, 1, 2804, 5584, 2, 23280, 1, 178, 2955, 2503, 1, 28147, 37, 20, 501, 67, 1940, 6, 982, 1, 6191, 216, 27, 18927, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 33, 5517, 649, 10662, 178, 216, 132, 2, 1976, 1065, 216, 14, 2, 18, 3533, 18, 1859, 112, 1189, 1, 18927, 20, 211, 230, 10465, 53858, 8044, 3, 501, 67, 517, 457, 2, 25, 1, 28147, 37, 802, 17, 363, 1, 18927, 16, 740, 9, 501, 67, 3642, 20, 46, 37, 408, 28147, 37, 3233, 6, 40, 8, 1283, 2592, 9, 86, 102, 37, 26, 31, 328, 6788, 8, 2926, 1515, 9, 3, 45, 1, 3, 314, 460, 1771, 4, 102, 62, 11588, 1, 26, 31, 328, 257, 1700, 3, 911, 1, 219, 637, 2, 1617, 3, 2696, 771, 2, 929, 1, 9169, 314, 222]",1532.0,14615384,IL-7-dependent human leukemia T-cell line valuable tool drug discovery T-ALL,0,0.0
Inhibition of breast and ovarian tumor growth through multiple signaling pathways by using retrovirus-mediated small interfering RNA against Her-2/neu gene expression.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2003-11-18,"The Her-2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast and ovarian cancer cases and often indicates a poor prognosis. Therapeutic agents against Her-2/neu have been intensively sought over the past decade. Here we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence the expression of Her-2/neu in models of human breast or ovarian cancer through retrovirus-mediated transfer of an siRNA against Her-2/neu. Cells infected with retrovirus expressing anti-Her-2/neu siRNA exhibit slower proliferation, increased apoptosis, increased G0/G1 arrest, and decreased tumor growth. Changes in cell cycle-associated factors included decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pAkt, and cyclin D1 and increased levels of p27 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Knockdown of Her-2/neu expression by siRNA is also associated with increased expression of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 and decreased expression of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that Her-2/neu stimulates tumor growth at least in part by regulating angiogenesis. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Her-2/neu and increasing the expression of thrombospondin-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for Her-2/neu-over-expressing breast or ovarian cancer.",Journal Article,5908.0,105.0,Her-2/neu oncogene overexpressed approximately 30 breast ovarian cases indicates poor prognosis Therapeutic agents Her-2/neu intensively sought past decade small interfering RNA siRNA silence expression Her-2/neu models human breast ovarian retrovirus-mediated transfer siRNA Her-2/neu infected retrovirus expressing anti-Her-2/neu siRNA exhibit slower proliferation increased apoptosis increased G0/G1 arrest decreased growth Changes cycle-associated factors included decreased levels phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pAkt cyclin D1 increased levels p27 phosphorylated retinoblastoma Knockdown Her-2/neu expression siRNA associated increased expression anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 decreased expression pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor suggesting Her-2/neu stimulates growth regulating angiogenesis siRNA-mediated silencing Her-2/neu increasing expression thrombospondin-1 useful therapeutic strategy Her-2/neu-over-expressing breast ovarian,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1084, 18, 1637, 1836, 16, 1711, 4, 705, 201, 1, 2, 12, 140, 2, 629, 2640, 8, 334, 356, 189, 183, 480, 1084, 18, 1637, 47, 85, 13240, 990, 252, 3, 1219, 2025, 467, 21, 514, 17, 302, 3449, 893, 1919, 122, 13557, 3, 55, 1, 1084, 18, 1637, 4, 274, 1, 171, 15, 12, 298, 16652, 517, 2602, 1, 35, 1919, 480, 1084, 18, 1637, 37, 3369, 5, 16652, 1046, 312, 1084, 18, 1637, 1919, 2239, 6715, 457, 101, 351, 101, 8588, 3344, 1854, 2, 340, 30, 129, 400, 4, 31, 417, 41, 130, 159, 340, 148, 1, 3415, 27, 216, 6724, 2, 1226, 2146, 2, 101, 148, 1, 2804, 2, 2365, 178, 1563, 1, 1084, 18, 1637, 55, 20, 1919, 16, 120, 41, 5, 101, 55, 1, 3, 312, 2068, 161, 12596, 14, 2, 340, 55, 1, 3, 1805, 2068, 756, 845, 129, 161, 802, 17, 1084, 18, 1637, 6200, 30, 129, 28, 506, 4, 760, 20, 2681, 1056, 1919, 517, 145, 2077, 1, 1084, 18, 1637, 2, 602, 3, 55, 1, 12596, 14, 68, 40, 8, 999, 189, 692, 9, 1084, 18, 1637, 252, 1046, 15, 12]",1202.0,14625284,Inhibition breast ovarian growth multiple signaling pathways retrovirus-mediated small interfering RNA Her-2/neu expression,0,0.0
Altered p16INK4a and Fhit expression in carcinogenesis and progression of human oral cancer.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2004-02-01,"To further characterize the biological and clinical role of molecular alterations involved in oral squamous carcinogenesis, the immunohistochemical expression level of two tumor suppressor genes, fragile histidine triad and p16INK4a, in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma was determined. In addition, human papillomavirus infection determined by PCR assay and the use of alcohol and cigarettes were evaluated. In this study 28 non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia and 57 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were considered. The expression levels of fragile histidine triad were lower in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma than in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. In contrast, p16INK4a is expressed in malignant lesions (51% of the cases analyzed), but not in non-carcinomatous squamous epithelia. No correlation between gene expression alterations of the two tumor suppressors was observed. PCR analysis showed that HPV DNA was present in 5 of the 57 malignant lesions analyzed (8.8%). None of the factors described above, despite changes in gene expression and HPV infection, appears to be associated with alcohol use and/or tobacco smoking and clinical outcome. Our data showed that fragile histidine triad and p16INK4a expression are altered in malignant lesions.

Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition as therapy for hematologic malignancies.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway, which mediates cell survival and proliferation. mTOR regulates essential signal-transduction pathways, is involved in the coupling of growth stimuli with cell cycle progression, and initiates mRNA translation in response to favorable nutrient environments. mTOR is involved in regulating many aspects of cell growth, including membrane traffic, protein degradation, protein kinase C signaling, ribosome biogenesis, and transcription. Because mTOR activates both the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, its inhibitors cause G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Inhibitors of mTOR also prevent cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activation, inhibit retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, and accelerate the turnover of cyclin D1, leading to a deficiency of active CDK4/cyclin D1 complexes, all of which may help cause G1-phase arrest. It is known that the phosphatase and tensin homologue tumor suppressor gene (PTEN) plays a major role in embryonic development, cell migration, and apoptosis. Malignancies with PTEN mutations, which are associated with constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, are relatively resistant to apoptosis and may be particularly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors.

A genetically defined model for human ovarian cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-03-01,"Disruptions of the p53, retinoblastoma (Rb), and RAS signaling pathways and activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) are common in human ovarian cancer; however, their precise role in ovarian cancer development is not clear. We thus introduced the catalytic subunit of hTERT, the SV40 early genomic region, and the oncogenic alleles of human HRAS or KRAS into human ovarian surface epithelial cells and examined the phenotype and gene expression profile of those cells. Disruption of p53 and Rb pathway by SV40 early genomic region and hTERT immortalized but did not transform the cells. Introduction of HRAS(V12) or KRAS(V12) into the immortalized cells, however, allowed them to form s.c. tumors after injection into immunocompromised mice. Peritoneal injection of the transformed cells produced undifferentiated carcinoma or malignant mixed Mullerian tumor and developed ascites; the tumor cells are focally positive for CA125 and mesothelin. Gene expression profile analysis of transformed cells revealed elevated expression of several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8, that are up-regulated by the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, which is known to contribute to the tumor growth of naturally ovarian cancer cells. Incubation with antibodies to IL-1beta or IL-8 led to apoptosis in the ras-transformed cells and ovarian cancer cells but not in immortalized cells that had not been transformed. Thus, the transformed human ovarian surface epithelial cells recapitulated many features of natural ovarian cancer including a subtype of ovarian cancer histology, formation of ascites, CA125 expression, and nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated cytokine activation.

The histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 interacts synergistically with fludarabine to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-04-01,"Interactions between the novel benzamide histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MS-275 and fludarabine were examined in lymphoid and myeloid human leukemia cells in relation to mitochondrial injury, signal transduction events, and apoptosis. Prior exposure of Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia cells to a marginally toxic concentration of MS-275 (e.g., 500 nM) for 24 h sharply increased mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis in response to a minimally toxic concentration of fludarabine (500 nM), resulting in highly synergistic antileukemic interactions and loss of clonogenic survival. Simultaneous exposure to MS-275 and fludarabine also led to synergistic effects, but these were not as pronounced as observed with sequential treatment. Similar interactions were noted in the case of (a) other human leukemia cell lines (e.g., U937, CCRF-CEM); (b) other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., sodium butyrate); and (c) other nucleoside analogues (e.g., 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, gemcitabine). Potentiation of fludarabine lethality by MS-275 was associated with acetylation of histones H3 and H4, down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Mcl-1, enhanced cytosolic release of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins (e.g., cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor), and caspase activation. It was also accompanied by the caspase-dependent down-regulation of p27(KIP1), cyclins A, E, and D(1), and cleavage and diminished phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. However, increased lethality of the combination was not associated with enhanced fludarabine triphosphate formation or DNA incorporation and occurred despite a slight reduction in the S-phase fraction. Prior exposure to MS-275 attenuated fludarabine-mediated activation of MEK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt, and enhanced c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation; furthermore, inducible expression of constitutively active MEK1/2 or Akt significantly diminished MS-275/fludarabine-induced lethality. Combined exposure of cells to MS-275 and fludarabine was associated with a significant increase in generation of reactive oxygen species; moreover, both the increase in reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were largely attenuated by coadministration of the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine. Finally, prior administration of MS-275 markedly potentiated fludarabine-mediated generation of the proapoptotic lipid second messenger ceramide. Taken together, these findings indicate that the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 induces multiple perturbations in signal transduction, survival, and cell cycle regulatory pathways that lower the threshold for fludarabine-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in human leukemia cells. They also provide insights into possible mechanisms by which novel, clinically relevant HDAC inhibitors might be used to enhance the antileukemic activity of established nucleoside analogues such as fludarabine.",Journal Article,5773.0,122.0,Interactions novel benzamide histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitor MS-275 fludarabine examined lymphoid myeloid human leukemia relation mitochondrial injury signal transduction events apoptosis Prior exposure Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia marginally toxic concentration MS-275 e.g. 500 nM 24 h sharply increased mitochondrial injury caspase activation apoptosis response minimally toxic concentration fludarabine 500 nM resulting highly synergistic antileukemic interactions loss clonogenic survival Simultaneous exposure MS-275 fludarabine led synergistic effects pronounced observed sequential treatment Similar interactions noted case human leukemia lines e.g. U937 CCRF-CEM b HDAC inhibitors e.g. sodium butyrate c nucleoside analogues e.g. 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine gemcitabine Potentiation fludarabine lethality MS-275 associated acetylation histones H3 H4 down-regulation antiapoptotic XIAP Mcl-1 enhanced cytosolic release proapoptotic mitochondrial e.g. cytochrome c Smac/DIABLO apoptosis-inducing factor caspase activation accompanied caspase-dependent down-regulation p27 KIP1 cyclins E 1 cleavage diminished phosphorylation retinoblastoma increased lethality combination associated enhanced fludarabine triphosphate formation DNA incorporation occurred despite slight reduction S-phase fraction Prior exposure MS-275 attenuated fludarabine-mediated activation MEK1/2 extracellular signal-regulated kinase Akt enhanced c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase phosphorylation furthermore inducible expression constitutively active MEK1/2 Akt significantly diminished MS-275/fludarabine-induced lethality Combined exposure MS-275 fludarabine associated significant increase generation reactive oxygen species increase reactive oxygen species apoptosis largely attenuated coadministration free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine Finally prior administration MS-275 markedly potentiated fludarabine-mediated generation proapoptotic lipid second messenger ceramide Taken findings indicate HDAC inhibitor MS-275 induces multiple perturbations signal transduction survival cycle regulatory pathways lower threshold fludarabine-mediated mitochondrial injury apoptosis human leukemia provide insights possible mechanisms novel clinically relevant HDAC inhibitors enhance antileukemic activity established nucleoside analogues fludarabine,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 229, 30578, 1508, 2732, 2654, 230, 2307, 5620, 2, 2027, 11, 409, 4, 2303, 2, 533, 171, 37, 4, 2191, 6, 2019, 2730, 1235, 2761, 281, 2, 351, 324, 645, 1, 8433, 1275, 37, 6, 8, 5007, 1812, 1227, 1, 2307, 5620, 563, 499, 1666, 2878, 9, 259, 555, 10833, 101, 2019, 2730, 1469, 363, 2, 351, 4, 51, 6, 8, 2144, 1812, 1227, 1, 2027, 1666, 2878, 1113, 4, 561, 1806, 4512, 1286, 2, 407, 1, 3798, 25, 2824, 645, 6, 2307, 5620, 2, 2027, 120, 836, 6, 1806, 176, 84, 46, 11, 44, 22, 3517, 22, 164, 5, 1787, 24, 288, 1286, 11, 1051, 4, 3, 473, 1, 8, 127, 171, 31, 285, 563, 499, 7000, 37256, 20211, 132, 127, 2654, 222, 563, 499, 4682, 12285, 2, 256, 127, 4032, 4768, 563, 499, 14, 1090, 427, 21019, 679, 9163, 1, 2027, 3266, 20, 2307, 5620, 10, 41, 5, 4145, 1, 8457, 3739, 2, 7812, 1328, 863, 1, 3, 4176, 652, 5387, 2, 1308, 14, 651, 7698, 2008, 1, 4118, 2019, 652, 563, 499, 4155, 256, 9251, 14415, 2, 351, 1958, 161, 2, 1469, 363, 192, 10, 120, 2756, 20, 3, 1469, 470, 1328, 863, 1, 2804, 5584, 10149, 8, 563, 2, 427, 14, 2, 3155, 2, 2849, 982, 1, 178, 137, 101, 3266, 1, 3, 150, 10, 44, 41, 5, 651, 2027, 7345, 1264, 15, 261, 2838, 2, 489, 550, 8, 8041, 628, 4, 3, 695, 124, 1509, 324, 645, 6, 2307, 5620, 2656, 2027, 517, 363, 1, 3893, 18, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 2, 649, 2, 651, 256, 4578, 6260, 18, 2158, 216, 982, 798, 2877, 55, 1, 2818, 544, 3893, 18, 15, 649, 97, 2849, 2307, 5620, 2027, 277, 3266, 397, 645, 1, 37, 6, 2307, 5620, 2, 2027, 10, 41, 5, 8, 93, 344, 4, 914, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 1393, 110, 3, 344, 4, 2163, 2848, 2915, 2, 351, 11, 1733, 2656, 20, 5777, 1, 3, 115, 711, 12545, 805, 78, 11729, 1368, 324, 634, 1, 2307, 5620, 2195, 6707, 2027, 517, 914, 1, 3, 4118, 3121, 419, 5992, 6307, 1633, 1162, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 3, 2654, 230, 2307, 5620, 1516, 232, 7013, 4, 1235, 2761, 25, 2, 31, 417, 1253, 460, 17, 280, 3, 2390, 9, 2027, 517, 2019, 2730, 2, 351, 4, 171, 37, 491, 120, 377, 1957, 237, 899, 483, 20, 92, 229, 505, 867, 2654, 222, 822, 40, 95, 6, 1304, 3, 4512, 128, 1, 635, 4032, 4768, 225, 22, 2027]",2838.0,15059916,histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 interacts synergistically fludarabine induce apoptosis human leukemia,0,0.0

Episcleral plaque brachytherapy for retinoblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2004-08-01,"The purpose of this study was to report our experience using episcleral plaque brachytherapy (EPBRT) to treat retinoblastoma and to demonstrate its applicability in multimodality treatment. We treated 26 tumors in 25 eyes from a group of 21 children with unilateral (n = 4) or bilateral (n = 17) retinoblastoma. The group comprised 8 girls and 13 boys; the median age was 25 months (range: 2-64 months) at the time of EPBRT. Iodine-125 ((125)I) was used for all applications. The median dose was 44 Gy (range: 35-47.6 Gy). EPBRT was administered primarily at the time of relapse after primary chemotherapy or radiation therapy. For eyes treated with EPBRT, the eye preservation rate was 15/25 with a median follow-up of 47 months (range: 2-198 months); the lesion control rate was 25/26 with a median follow-up of 13 months (range: 1-140 months). The median time to additional whole-eye treatment after EPBRT was 12 months (range: 2-105 months). Similar to previously reported series, EPBRT shows a high rate of successful tumor control as a primary treatment for retinoblastoma, as well as a secondary therapy at the time of relapse. EPBRT also allows for a clinically significant delay in the time to additional measures for the affected eye.

Lack of activity of oral etoposide for relapsed intraocular retinoblastoma.,Ophthalmic genetics,Ophthalmic Genet.,2004-03-01,"Intravenous etoposide is widely used in multiagent chemotherapy regimens for intraocular retinoblastoma despite the lack of phase II data documenting its efficacy. Because oral etoposide has been found to be highly effective in patients with relapsed medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma who had previously received intravenous etoposide, we investigated its use for intraocular retinoblastoma. A pilot trial of oral etoposide (50 mg/m2/ day for 21 days) in five children (6 eyes) with relapsed refractory intraocular retinoblastoma was performed. All had previously received chemotherapy, including intravenous etoposide in four patients, and all had received radiation therapy. Three patients (3 eyes) had vitreous seeds. Response was evaluated after one cycle. No serious acute toxicity was encountered, and no responses were noted. Four patients (5 eyes) had progressive disease. Stable disease was noted in one eye without vitreous disease. One patient developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia 30 months after exposure to oral etoposide. Oral etoposide was not an effective agent in this population.

Cancer Res.,2004-07-01,"E7070 is a synthetic sulfonamide cell cycle inhibitor that induces hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and G(1) arrest in vitro. This Phase II study was conducted to explore the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of E7070 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with metastatic, recurrent, or refractory SCCHN, treated with no more than one prior therapy for recurrent disease, received E7070 at 700 mg/m(2) over 1 h every 3 weeks. Pre- and posttreatment tumor fine needle aspirates were subjected to immunohistochemistry with a panel of phospho-specific anti-Rb antibodies. End points included progression-free survival, response rate and duration, overall survival, toxicity profile, and inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. Because none of the first 15 patients achieved progression-free survival > 4 months, the early stopping rule was invoked. Eleven patients had oropharyngeal cancer and 12 were male. Median age was 59 years (range, 49-73 years). Thirty-nine cycles of E7070 were delivered (median, 2.6 cycles/patient; range, 1-5 cycles). Six patients had stable disease after 2 cycles and 2 patients each subsequently received 1, 2, and 3 additional cycles, respectively, before experiencing progression. Immunohistochemistry of tumor cell aspirates from 3 patients demonstrated reduced Rb phosphorylation posttreatment. At this dose and schedule, E7070 is unlikely to be superior over single-agent chemotherapy in SCCHN. However, the data suggest that cdk activity can be inhibited in tumor cells, resulting in posttreatment modulation of Rb phosphorylation. In the absence of cytotoxicity, more frequent administration of E7070 may be required to sustain Rb hypophosphorylation and cytostatic growth arrest.",Clinical Trial,5682.0,37.0,E7070 synthetic sulfonamide cycle inhibitor induces hypophosphorylation retinoblastoma Rb G 1 arrest vitro Phase II conducted explore efficacy safety pharmacodynamics E7070 squamous carcinoma head neck SCCHN Patients metastatic recurrent refractory SCCHN treated prior therapy recurrent disease received E7070 700 mg/m 2 1 h 3 weeks Pre- posttreatment fine needle aspirates subjected immunohistochemistry panel phospho-specific anti-Rb antibodies End points included progression-free survival response rate duration overall survival toxicity profile inhibition Rb phosphorylation 15 patients achieved progression-free survival 4 months early stopping rule invoked patients oropharyngeal 12 male Median age 59 years range 49-73 years Thirty-nine cycles E7070 delivered median 2.6 cycles/patient range 1-5 cycles patients stable disease 2 cycles 2 patients subsequently received 1 2 3 additional cycles respectively experiencing progression Immunohistochemistry aspirates 3 patients demonstrated reduced Rb phosphorylation posttreatment dose schedule E7070 unlikely superior single-agent chemotherapy SCCHN suggest cdk activity inhibited resulting posttreatment modulation Rb phosphorylation absence cytotoxicity frequent administration E7070 required sustain Rb hypophosphorylation cytostatic growth arrest,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[28260, 16, 8, 3273, 24736, 31, 417, 230, 17, 1516, 21052, 1, 3, 2955, 178, 2, 499, 14, 1854, 4, 439, 26, 124, 215, 45, 10, 426, 6, 1645, 3, 209, 367, 2, 3587, 1, 28260, 4, 691, 31, 134, 1, 3, 718, 2, 2999, 7, 5, 113, 387, 15, 430, 2999, 73, 5, 77, 80, 76, 104, 324, 36, 9, 387, 34, 103, 28260, 28, 5692, 81, 188, 18, 252, 14, 555, 454, 27, 244, 671, 2, 3149, 30, 2924, 2177, 7493, 11, 4325, 6, 888, 5, 8, 993, 1, 3125, 112, 312, 2955, 890, 396, 862, 159, 91, 115, 25, 51, 116, 2, 654, 63, 25, 155, 800, 2, 297, 1, 2955, 982, 408, 1292, 1, 3, 157, 167, 7, 513, 91, 115, 25, 39, 53, 3, 191, 6811, 5340, 10, 28261, 2627, 7, 42, 12, 2, 133, 11, 1045, 52, 89, 10, 728, 60, 184, 739, 803, 60, 977, 762, 410, 1, 28260, 11, 1623, 52, 18, 49, 410, 69, 184, 14, 33, 410, 437, 7, 42, 585, 34, 50, 18, 410, 2, 18, 7, 296, 1611, 103, 14, 18, 2, 27, 402, 410, 106, 348, 2985, 91, 888, 1, 30, 31, 7493, 29, 27, 7, 264, 405, 2955, 982, 3149, 28, 26, 61, 2, 1055, 28260, 16, 3568, 6, 40, 1123, 252, 226, 420, 56, 4, 2999, 137, 3, 74, 309, 17, 3954, 128, 122, 40, 879, 4, 30, 37, 1113, 4, 3149, 2356, 1, 2955, 982, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 1408, 80, 908, 634, 1, 28260, 68, 40, 616, 6, 8844, 2955, 21052, 2, 8154, 129, 1854]",1680.0,15269140,phase II clinical pharmacodynamic E7070 patients metastatic recurrent refractory squamous carcinoma head neck modulation retinoblastoma phosphorylation novel chloroindolyl sulfonamide cycle inhibitor,0,0.0
Genetically modified adenoviruses against gliomas: from bench to bedside.,Neurology,Neurology,2004-08-01,"Oncolytic or tumor-selective adenoviruses are constructed as novel antiglioma therapies. After infection, the invading genetic adenoviral material is activated within the host cell. E1A and E1B adenoviral proteins are expressed immediately. E1A protein interacts with cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as retinoblastoma (Rb), driving the cell into the S phase and ensuing viral replication. The action of E1A stimulates the cellular p53 tumor suppressor system, which results in growth arrest or apoptosis, and halts adenovirus replication. However, adenoviral E1B interacts with p53 protein, preventing the DNA replication process from being abrogated by the induction of p53-mediated apoptosis. It was subsequently hypothesized that mutant adenoviruses that were unable to express wild-type E1A or E1B proteins could not replicate in normal cells with functional Rb or p53 pathways but instead would replicate and kill glioma cells that had defects in the regulation of these tumor suppressor pathways. Mutant E1B adenoviruses have already entered the clinical setting as an experimental treatment for patients with malignant gliomas. Mutant E1A adenoviruses are now in preclinical development as antiglioma therapy. In this review, the authors describe the mechanisms underlying the production of oncolytic adenoviruses, preclinical and clinical experiences with specific oncolytic adenoviruses, and the possibilities of combining mutant oncolytic adenoviruses with gene therapy or conventional therapies for managing malignant gliomas.",Journal Article,5651.0,33.0,Oncolytic tumor-selective adenoviruses constructed novel antiglioma therapies infection invading genetic adenoviral material activated host E1A E1B adenoviral expressed immediately E1A interacts cycle regulatory retinoblastoma Rb driving phase ensuing viral replication action E1A stimulates cellular p53 suppressor growth arrest apoptosis halts adenovirus replication adenoviral E1B interacts p53 preventing DNA replication process abrogated induction p53-mediated apoptosis subsequently hypothesized adenoviruses unable express wild-type E1A E1B replicate normal functional Rb p53 pathways instead replicate kill glioma defects regulation suppressor pathways E1B adenoviruses entered clinical setting experimental treatment patients malignant gliomas E1A adenoviruses preclinical development antiglioma therapy review authors mechanisms underlying production oncolytic adenoviruses preclinical clinical experiences specific oncolytic adenoviruses possibilities combining oncolytic adenoviruses therapy conventional therapies managing malignant gliomas,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3236, 15, 30, 1094, 9470, 32, 2776, 22, 229, 14492, 235, 50, 930, 3, 8653, 336, 4771, 3692, 16, 735, 262, 3, 1204, 31, 6822, 2, 17646, 4771, 652, 32, 570, 3467, 6822, 178, 5528, 5, 31, 417, 1253, 652, 225, 22, 2955, 4057, 3, 31, 237, 3, 695, 124, 2, 11937, 1667, 2079, 3, 1578, 1, 6822, 6200, 3, 763, 624, 30, 1245, 398, 92, 99, 4, 129, 1854, 15, 351, 2, 33196, 4488, 2079, 137, 4771, 17646, 5528, 5, 624, 178, 3017, 3, 261, 2079, 1129, 29, 486, 3728, 20, 3, 504, 1, 624, 517, 351, 192, 10, 1611, 1237, 17, 620, 9470, 17, 11, 4253, 6, 1669, 955, 267, 6822, 15, 17646, 652, 359, 44, 6423, 4, 295, 37, 5, 583, 2955, 15, 624, 460, 84, 3496, 688, 6423, 2, 5097, 945, 37, 17, 42, 2945, 4, 3, 863, 1, 46, 30, 1245, 460, 620, 17646, 9470, 47, 3298, 2836, 3, 38, 546, 22, 35, 1560, 24, 9, 7, 5, 393, 1287, 620, 6822, 9470, 32, 1134, 4, 693, 193, 22, 14492, 36, 4, 26, 206, 3, 738, 897, 3, 483, 1181, 3, 1529, 1, 3236, 9470, 693, 2, 38, 4031, 5, 112, 3236, 9470, 2, 3, 10433, 1, 1525, 620, 3236, 9470, 5, 145, 36, 15, 809, 235, 9, 3969, 393, 1287]",1505.0,15304571,Genetically modified adenoviruses gliomas bench bedside,3,0.015463917525773196
Outcome following initial external beam radiotherapy in patients with Reese-Ellsworth group Vb retinoblastoma.,"Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch. Ophthalmol.,2004-09-01,"To describe patient and ocular outcomes following initial treatment with external beam radiotherapy (EBT) in eyes with Reese-Ellsworth group Vb retinoblastoma. Retrospective case series (from January 1, 1979, to February 28, 2002). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival (ocular and patient) and incidence (second cancer) data. Two hundred forty-three patients with 1 or more Reese-Ellsworth group Vb eyes were identified. Of 284 group Vb eyes, 63 (22.2%) initially received EBT, vs 172 (60.6%) that were initially enucleated. Of the 63 radiated group Vb eyes, 31 (49.2%) had no further tumor growth, 26 (41.3%) developed a recurrence, and 8 (12.7%) developed a new tumor. Of the 63 radiated group Vb eyes, 33 (52.4%) developed ocular complications. The ocular survival rate of radiated group Vb eyes was 81.4% at 1 year and 53.4% at 10 years. Twenty-eight radiated group Vb eyes survived to the last follow-up with visual acuity information. Thirteen patients developed second cancers, 11 in the field of radiation. The probability of developing a second cancer following initial EBT for group Vb disease in patients with bilateral disease was 29.7% by 10 years after diagnosis. Survival from second cancers in patients with bilateral disease initially receiving EBT for group Vb disease was 93.6% at 5 years and 52.6% at 18(1/4) years.

AP-1 blockade in breast cancer cells causes cell cycle arrest by suppressing G1 cyclin expression and reducing cyclin-dependent kinase activity.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2004-10-01,"The AP-1 transcription factor is a central component of signal transduction pathways in many cells, although the exact role of AP-1 in controlling cell growth and malignant transformation is unknown. We have previously shown that AP-1 complexes are activated by peptide and steroid growth factors in both normal and malignant breast cells, and that blocking AP-1 by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of cJun (cJun-DN, TAM67) inhibits breast cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesized that TAM67 inhibits cell growth by altering the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, thus causing a cell cycle block. In the present study, we used clones of MCF7 breast cancer cells that express TAM67 under the control of an inducible promoter. First, we determined the effect of AP-1 blockade on cell growth, then we performed 3H-thymidine incorporation and flow cytometry assays to investigate whether TAM67 inhibits the cell cycle. We observed that in the presence of serum TAM67 inhibited cell growth and caused a block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Next, we performed Western-blotting and CDK kinase assays to determine the effects of TAM67 on retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation, the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and CDK activity. We discovered that TAM67 inhibited Rb phosphorylation and reduced E2F activity. We also found that TAM67 decreased the expression of D and E cyclins, reduced CDK2 and CDK4 activity, and increased the CDK inhibitor p27. The studies of gene expression at the RNA level showed that TAM67 decreased cyclin Ds mRNA expression. Our study suggests that in the presence of serum, TAM67 inhibits breast cancer growth predominantly by inducing inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (such as p27) and by reducing the expression of the cyclins involved in transitioning from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. These studies lay the foundation for future attempt to develop new agents for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.",Journal Article,5590.0,48.0,AP-1 transcription factor central component signal transduction pathways exact role AP-1 controlling growth malignant transformation unknown previously shown AP-1 complexes activated peptide steroid growth factors normal malignant breast blocking AP-1 overexpressing dominant-negative form cJun cJun-DN TAM67 inhibits breast growth vivo vitro hypothesized TAM67 inhibits growth altering expression cycle regulatory causing cycle block present clones MCF7 breast express TAM67 control inducible promoter determined effect AP-1 blockade growth performed 3H-thymidine incorporation flow cytometry investigate TAM67 inhibits cycle observed presence serum TAM67 inhibited growth caused block G1 phase cycle performed Western-blotting CDK kinase determine effects TAM67 retinoblastoma Rb phosphorylation expression cycle regulatory CDK activity discovered TAM67 inhibited Rb phosphorylation reduced E2F activity TAM67 decreased expression E cyclins reduced CDK2 CDK4 activity increased CDK inhibitor p27 studies expression RNA level showed TAM67 decreased cyclin Ds mRNA expression suggests presence serum TAM67 inhibits breast growth predominantly inducing inhibitors cyclin-dependent kinases p27 reducing expression cyclins involved transitioning G1 phase cycle studies lay foundation future attempt develop new agents treatment prevention breast,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2517, 14, 866, 161, 16, 8, 854, 1249, 1, 1235, 2761, 460, 4, 445, 37, 242, 3, 2472, 200, 1, 2517, 14, 4, 1893, 31, 129, 2, 393, 1392, 16, 860, 21, 47, 373, 443, 17, 2517, 14, 3817, 32, 735, 20, 1389, 2, 3853, 129, 130, 4, 110, 295, 2, 393, 37, 2, 17, 2521, 2517, 14, 20, 2810, 8, 2156, 199, 1297, 1, 17684, 17684, 6504, 12547, 1576, 12, 31, 129, 110, 4, 386, 2, 4, 439, 21, 1237, 17, 12547, 1576, 31, 129, 20, 4831, 3, 55, 1, 31, 417, 1253, 652, 631, 3440, 8, 31, 417, 2381, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 95, 2749, 1, 6356, 12, 37, 17, 1669, 12547, 669, 3, 182, 1, 35, 2877, 973, 157, 21, 509, 3, 254, 1, 2517, 14, 1189, 23, 31, 129, 818, 21, 173, 16306, 6403, 2838, 2, 1412, 1914, 1013, 6, 963, 317, 12547, 1576, 3, 31, 417, 21, 164, 17, 4, 3, 463, 1, 524, 12547, 879, 31, 129, 2, 1546, 8, 2381, 4, 3, 3344, 124, 1, 3, 31, 417, 1305, 21, 173, 1521, 3661, 2, 3954, 216, 1013, 6, 223, 3, 176, 1, 12547, 23, 2955, 982, 3, 55, 1, 31, 417, 1253, 652, 2, 3954, 128, 21, 2747, 17, 12547, 879, 2955, 982, 2, 405, 5391, 128, 21, 120, 204, 17, 12547, 340, 3, 55, 1, 427, 2, 563, 10149, 405, 4547, 2, 3254, 128, 2, 101, 3, 3954, 230, 2804, 3, 94, 1, 145, 55, 28, 3, 893, 301, 224, 17, 12547, 340, 1226, 3602, 956, 55, 114, 45, 844, 17, 4, 3, 463, 1, 524, 12547, 1576, 12, 129, 2117, 20, 1958, 222, 1, 1226, 470, 1549, 225, 22, 2804, 2, 20, 1818, 3, 55, 1, 3, 10149, 646, 4, 16807, 29, 3344, 237, 695, 124, 1, 3, 31, 417, 46, 94, 9455, 3, 3247, 9, 508, 3448, 6, 690, 217, 183, 9, 3, 24, 2, 1070, 1, 12]",1920.0,15378019,AP-1 blockade breast causes cycle arrest suppressing G1 cyclin expression reducing cyclin-dependent kinase activity,16,0.08247422680412371
Expression of p27 in residual rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation predicts long-term outcome.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2004-10-15,"Compared with surgery alone, preoperative radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (combined-modality therapy; CMT) improves outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Although numerous studies have focused on identifying molecular markers of prognosis in the primary rectal cancer before CMT, our aim was to identify markers of prognosis in residual rectal cancer after preoperative CMT. Sixty-seven patients with locally advanced (T3-4 and/or N1) rectal cancer were treated with preoperative radiotherapy (median, 5040 cGy) with or without 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Residual tumor in the resected specimen, available for 52 patients, was analyzed for tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, and immunohistochemical expression of p27, p21, p53, Ki-67, retinoblastoma gene, cyclin D1, and bcl-2. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. With a median follow-up of 69 months, the overall 5-year RFS was 74%. RFS was significantly worse for patients with positive p27 expression (P = .005), T3-4 tumors (P = .02), and positive lymph nodes (P = .04) in the irradiated specimen. On multivariate analysis, positive p27 expression remained an independent negative prognostic factor for RFS (P = .04). None of the other proteins was significantly associated with RFS. Our results indicate that positive p27 expression in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation is an independent negative predictor of RFS. Expression of p27 in the residual rectal cancer may therefore identify patients with disease likely to be refractory to standard therapy and for whom investigational approaches should be strongly considered.",Journal Article,5576.0,20.0,Compared surgery preoperative radiotherapy 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy combined-modality therapy CMT improves outcomes patients locally advanced rectal numerous studies focused identifying molecular markers prognosis primary rectal CMT aim identify markers prognosis residual rectal preoperative CMT Sixty-seven patients locally advanced T3-4 and/or N1 rectal treated preoperative radiotherapy median 5040 cGy 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy Residual resected specimen available 52 patients tumor-node-metastasis stage lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion immunohistochemical expression p27 p21 p53 Ki-67 retinoblastoma cyclin D1 bcl-2 Recurrence-free survival RFS determined Kaplan-Meier compared log-rank test median follow-up 69 months overall 5-year RFS 74 RFS significantly worse patients positive p27 expression P .005 T3-4 P .02 positive lymph nodes P .04 irradiated specimen multivariate positive p27 expression remained independent negative prognostic factor RFS P .04 significantly associated RFS indicate positive p27 expression rectal preoperative chemoradiation independent negative predictor RFS Expression p27 residual rectal identify patients disease likely refractory standard therapy investigational approaches strongly considered,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[72, 5, 152, 279, 498, 310, 2, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 397, 1396, 36, 5380, 1804, 123, 4, 7, 5, 795, 131, 12, 242, 2331, 94, 47, 1649, 23, 1386, 219, 525, 1, 356, 4, 3, 86, 12, 348, 5380, 114, 1130, 10, 6, 255, 525, 1, 356, 4, 753, 12, 50, 498, 5380, 1746, 648, 7, 5, 795, 131, 2065, 39, 2, 15, 3192, 12, 11, 73, 5, 498, 310, 52, 18992, 3071, 5, 15, 187, 33, 1404, 90, 56, 753, 30, 4, 3, 1133, 2360, 390, 9, 653, 7, 10, 311, 9, 30, 289, 278, 82, 2933, 2, 15, 4917, 578, 2, 1382, 55, 1, 2804, 2657, 624, 2311, 598, 145, 1226, 2146, 2, 1044, 18, 146, 115, 25, 1272, 10, 509, 20, 3, 876, 882, 596, 2, 72, 20, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 790, 53, 3, 63, 33, 111, 1272, 10, 794, 1272, 10, 97, 639, 9, 7, 5, 109, 2804, 55, 19, 1614, 2065, 39, 57, 19, 588, 2, 109, 263, 502, 19, 755, 4, 3, 2398, 2360, 23, 331, 65, 109, 2804, 55, 958, 35, 306, 199, 177, 161, 9, 1272, 19, 755, 1292, 1, 3, 127, 652, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1272, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 109, 2804, 55, 4, 12, 50, 498, 975, 16, 35, 306, 199, 980, 1, 1272, 55, 1, 2804, 4, 3, 753, 12, 68, 673, 255, 7, 5, 34, 322, 6, 40, 430, 6, 260, 36, 2, 9, 953, 3093, 611, 257, 40, 1327, 515]",1636.0,15525823,Expression p27 residual rectal preoperative chemoradiation predicts long-term outcome,0,0.0

A search of published articles in Medline (PubMed) and abstracts from professional meetings was performed. An electronic database search of patients with CLL at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) determined the incidence of Richter syndrome (RS) in patients with CLL between 1992 and 2002. RS occurs in approximately 5% of patients with CLL. The large cells of RS may arise through transformation of the original CLL clone or represent a new neoplasm. RS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus. Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities are more frequent in patients with RS than in the overall population of patients with CLL. Multiple genetic defects, such as mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, p16INK4A, and p21, loss of p27 expression, deletion of retinoblastoma, increased copy number of C-MYC, and decreased expression of the A-MYB gene, have been described. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and-by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities-to transform into RS cells. Therapeutic strategies include intensive chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and stem cell transplantation. The response rates range from 5% to 43% (complete response, 5-38%), and the median survival duration ranges from 5 months to 8 months.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the frequency of bone marrow involvement in our series of retinoblastoma patients and to investigate whether the use of four bone marrow aspirates (BMA) and two bone marrow biopsies (BMB) has greater sensitivity for the detection of metastatic disease compared to what has been previously reported. Retrospective analysis of the charts of 54 patients with retinoblastoma was performed. We performed 265 BMA, 134 BMB (4 aspirates and 2 biopsies per evaluation), and 67 lumbar punctures (LPs) in 54 patients with retinoblastoma. There were no patients found with bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement at the time of the initial diagnosis. Although no patient died of distant metastases, two patients developed metastatic disease at recurrence, involving the bone marrow and other sites. For these two patients all four aspirates and two biopsies were positive for disease at the time of recurrence. Despite the use of four BMA and two BMB (as opposed to one bone marrow aspirate that is routinely performed in other centers), the detection of patients with metastatic disease was similar to what has been previously reported. Based on these data more aggressive evaluation of the bone marrow in retinoblastoma patients with clinically limited disease using four aspirates and two biopsies cannot be supported.",Journal Article,5133.0,4.0,Bone marrow involvement retinoblastoma patients rare industrialized nations purpose current determine frequency bone marrow involvement series retinoblastoma patients investigate use bone marrow aspirates BMA bone marrow biopsies BMB greater sensitivity detection metastatic disease compared previously reported Retrospective charts 54 patients retinoblastoma performed performed 265 BMA 134 BMB 4 aspirates 2 biopsies evaluation 67 lumbar punctures LPs 54 patients retinoblastoma patients bone marrow cerebrospinal fluid CSF involvement time initial diagnosis patient died distant metastases patients developed metastatic disease recurrence involving bone marrow sites patients aspirates biopsies positive disease time recurrence Despite use BMA BMB opposed bone marrow aspirate routinely performed centers detection patients metastatic disease similar previously reported Based aggressive evaluation bone marrow retinoblastoma patients clinically limited disease aspirates biopsies supported,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[581, 799, 4, 7, 16, 622, 4, 3, 80, 18328, 14456, 3, 743, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 675, 1, 581, 799, 4, 114, 988, 1, 7, 2, 6, 963, 317, 3, 119, 1, 294, 581, 7493, 22315, 2, 100, 581, 1154, 38011, 71, 378, 485, 9, 3, 638, 1, 113, 34, 72, 6, 2067, 71, 85, 373, 210, 459, 65, 1, 3, 4413, 1, 667, 7, 5, 10, 173, 21, 173, 7298, 22315, 4842, 38011, 39, 7493, 2, 18, 1154, 379, 451, 2, 598, 6187, 22260, 6310, 4, 667, 7, 5, 125, 11, 77, 7, 204, 5, 581, 15, 5156, 2357, 1211, 799, 28, 3, 98, 1, 3, 388, 147, 242, 77, 69, 1016, 1, 626, 196, 100, 7, 276, 113, 34, 28, 146, 1267, 3, 581, 2, 127, 633, 9, 46, 100, 7, 62, 294, 7493, 2, 100, 1154, 11, 109, 9, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 146, 550, 3, 119, 1, 294, 22315, 2, 100, 38011, 22, 6101, 6, 104, 581, 8022, 17, 16, 3066, 173, 4, 127, 1168, 3, 638, 1, 7, 5, 113, 34, 10, 288, 6, 2067, 71, 85, 373, 210, 90, 23, 46, 74, 80, 571, 451, 1, 3, 581, 4, 7, 5, 505, 383, 34, 75, 294, 7493, 2, 100, 1154, 122, 44, 40, 2708]",1327.0,16123998,aggressive bone marrow screening retinoblastoma patients indicated memorial Sloan-Kettering center experience,3,0.015463917525773196

"Treatment planning with protons for pediatric retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pelvic sarcoma: how do protons compare with other conformal techniques?","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-10-01,"To calculate treatment plans and compare the dose distributions and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for photon three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), electron therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and standard (nonintensity modulated) proton therapy in three pediatric disease sites. The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2 medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma, three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were assessed. In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69% for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for 3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae, mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons) and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors.",Comparative Study,5225.0,173.0,calculate treatment plans compare dose distributions dose-volume histograms DVHs photon three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 3D-CRT electron therapy

Adenovirus vectors were used to transfer cDNAs into human glioblastoma and sarcoma cells. Telomerase activity was assessed with a telomere repeat amplification protocol. Promoter activity in cancer cells was assessed with promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Promoter binding was assessed with the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. We isolated astrocytes from E2F1 transgenic mice and normal mice for in vivo studies. We evaluated the expression of E2F1 and hTERT (the catalytic subunit of human telomerase) mRNAs by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and proteins in human glioblastoma samples by immunoblot analysis. Associations between survival among 61 glioblastoma multiforme patients and expression of E2F1 and hTERT mRNA and protein were examined with Kaplan-Meier analysis, the log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Ectopic E2F1 expression increased hTERT promoter activity in cancer cells. We detected an interaction between E2F1 protein and the hTERT promoter. Transgenic E2F1 astrocytes contained functional telomerase protein. E2F1 mRNA expression and hTERT mRNA expression were statistically significantly correlated in human glioblastoma specimens (R = .8; P < .001). Longer median survival was statistically significantly associated with lower E2F1 mRNA expression in tumors (103.6 weeks) rather than with higher expression (46.1 weeks) (difference = 57.5 weeks; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.7 to 159.7; log-rank P = .002). E2F1 mRNA was the only factor that was statistically significantly associated with overall survival in a multivariable model (P = .04). Among 27 patients with glioblastoma multiforme samples, the expression of E2F1 protein was statistically significantly associated with survival (log-rank P < .001). E2F1 may participate in telomerase activity regulation in malignant glioma cells. Its expression appears to be strongly associated with the survival of patients with malignant brain tumors.",Journal Article,5194.0,43.0,suppressor pathways identified modulators telomerase function examined functional role retinoblastoma-E2F1 pathway regulating telomerase activity malignant gliomas Adenovirus vectors transfer cDNAs human glioblastoma sarcoma Telomerase activity assessed telomere repeat amplification protocol Promoter activity assessed promoter-luciferase reporter constructs Promoter binding assessed chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP isolated astrocytes E2F1 transgenic mice normal mice vivo studies evaluated expression E2F1 hTERT catalytic subunit human telomerase mRNAs reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction human glioblastoma immunoblot Associations survival 61 glioblastoma multiforme patients expression E2F1 hTERT mRNA examined Kaplan-Meier log-rank test Cox proportional hazards regression models statistical tests two-sided Ectopic E2F1 expression increased hTERT promoter activity detected interaction E2F1 hTERT promoter Transgenic E2F1 astrocytes contained functional telomerase E2F1 mRNA expression hTERT mRNA expression statistically significantly correlated human glioblastoma specimens R .8 P .001 Longer median survival statistically significantly associated lower E2F1 mRNA expression 103.6 weeks higher expression 46.1 weeks difference 57.5 weeks 95 confidence interval CI 14.7 159.7 log-rank P .002 E2F1 mRNA factor statistically significantly associated overall survival multivariable model P .04 27 patients glioblastoma multiforme expression E2F1 statistically significantly associated survival log-rank P .001 E2F1 participate telomerase activity regulation malignant glioma expression appears strongly associated survival patients malignant brain,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[392, 30, 1245, 460, 47, 85, 108, 22, 5014, 1, 3916, 343, 21, 409, 3, 583, 200, 1, 3, 18175, 6112, 308, 4, 2681, 3916, 128, 4, 393, 1287, 4488, 5453, 11, 95, 6, 2602, 16177, 237, 171, 996, 2, 37, 3916, 128, 10, 275, 5, 8, 4136, 2334, 1073, 1182, 973, 128, 4, 12, 37, 10, 275, 5, 973, 3864, 3674, 5500, 973, 791, 10, 275, 5, 3, 2287, 4857, 4222, 719, 21, 1355, 7719, 29, 6112, 2862, 399, 2, 295, 399, 9, 4, 386, 94, 21, 194, 3, 55, 1, 6112, 2, 6431, 3, 4784, 3350, 1, 171, 3916, 7503, 20, 1772, 4456, 1451, 1260, 1329, 2, 652, 4, 171, 996, 347, 20, 7625, 65, 685, 59, 25, 107, 713, 996, 3238, 7, 2, 55, 1, 6112, 2, 6431, 956, 2, 178, 11, 409, 5, 876, 882, 65, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 2, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 274, 62, 1050, 895, 11, 100, 1689, 3647, 6112, 55, 101, 6431, 973, 128, 4, 12, 37, 21, 530, 35, 915, 59, 6112, 178, 2, 3, 6431, 973, 2862, 6112, 7719, 3070, 583, 3916, 178, 6112, 956, 55, 2, 6431, 956, 55, 11, 712, 97, 438, 4, 171, 996, 623, 668, 66, 19, 144, 589, 52, 25, 10, 712, 97, 41, 5, 280, 6112, 956, 55, 4, 57, 3283, 49, 244, 1832, 76, 5, 142, 55, 641, 14, 244, 523, 696, 33, 244, 48, 307, 268, 58, 213, 67, 6, 5917, 67, 1066, 1026, 19, 1111, 6112, 956, 10, 3, 158, 161, 17, 10, 712, 97, 41, 5, 63, 25, 4, 8, 658, 202, 19, 755, 107, 428, 7, 5, 996, 3238, 347, 3, 55, 1, 6112, 178, 10, 712, 97, 41, 5, 25, 1066, 1026, 19, 144, 6112, 68, 3506, 4, 3916, 128, 863, 4, 393, 945, 37, 211, 55, 1233, 6, 40, 1327, 41, 5, 3, 25, 1, 7, 5, 393, 342, 57]",2175.0,16264179,Expression transcription factor E2F1 telomerase glioblastomas mechanistic linkage prognostic significance,0,0.0
Inactivation of the Snf5 tumor suppressor stimulates cell cycle progression and cooperates with p53 loss in oncogenic transformation.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2005-11-21,"Snf5 (Ini1/Baf47/Smarcb1), a core member of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex, is a potent tumor suppressor whose mechanism of action is largely unknown. Biallelic loss of Snf5 leads to the onset of aggressive cancers in both humans and mice. We have developed an innovative and widely applicable analytical technique for cross-species validation of cancer models and show that the gene expression profiles of our Snf5 murine models closely resemble those of human Snf5-deficient rhabdoid tumors. We exploit this system to produce what we believe to be the first report documenting the effects on gene expression of inactivating a Swi/Snf subunit in normal mammalian cells and to identify the transcriptional pathways regulated by Snf5. We demonstrate that the tumor suppressor activity of Snf5 depends on its regulation of cell cycle progression; Snf5 inactivation leads to aberrant up-regulation of E2F targets and increased levels of p53 that are accompanied by apoptosis, polyploidy, and growth arrest. Further, conditional mouse models demonstrate that inactivation of p16Ink4a or Rb (retinoblastoma) does not accelerate tumor formation in Snf5 conditional mice, whereas mutation of p53 leads to a dramatic acceleration of tumor formation.",Journal Article,5174.0,145.0,Snf5 Ini1/Baf47/Smarcb1 core member Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex potent suppressor mechanism action largely unknown Biallelic loss Snf5 leads onset aggressive humans mice developed innovative widely applicable analytical technique cross-species validation models expression profiles Snf5 murine models closely resemble human Snf5-deficient rhabdoid exploit produce believe report documenting effects expression inactivating Swi/Snf subunit normal mammalian identify transcriptional pathways regulated Snf5 demonstrate suppressor activity Snf5 depends regulation cycle progression Snf5 inactivation leads aberrant up-regulation E2F targets increased levels p53 accompanied apoptosis polyploidy growth arrest conditional mouse models demonstrate inactivation p16Ink4a Rb retinoblastoma accelerate formation Snf5 conditional mice p53 leads dramatic acceleration formation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6976, 11933, 17693, 5952, 8, 1793, 2693, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 2287, 4429, 840, 16, 8, 1157, 30, 1245, 1310, 670, 1, 1578, 16, 1733, 860, 6435, 407, 1, 6976, 1940, 6, 3, 1707, 1, 571, 163, 4, 110, 3218, 2, 399, 21, 47, 276, 35, 4019, 2, 1792, 3801, 5625, 1312, 9, 1383, 2915, 929, 1, 12, 274, 2, 514, 17, 3, 145, 55, 1241, 1, 114, 6976, 1471, 274, 3210, 8247, 135, 1, 171, 6976, 1971, 57, 21, 6109, 26, 398, 6, 2410, 2067, 21, 4629, 6, 40, 3, 157, 414, 9255, 3, 176, 23, 145, 55, 1, 6096, 8, 4983, 5071, 3350, 4, 295, 2359, 37, 2, 6, 255, 3, 1431, 460, 1065, 20, 6976, 21, 608, 17, 3, 30, 1245, 128, 1, 6976, 3828, 23, 211, 863, 1, 31, 417, 91, 6976, 2297, 1940, 6, 1898, 126, 863, 1, 5391, 637, 2, 101, 148, 1, 624, 17, 32, 2756, 20, 351, 24874, 2, 129, 1854, 195, 3212, 830, 274, 608, 17, 2297, 1, 13747, 15, 2955, 1097, 44, 5792, 30, 1264, 4, 6976, 3212, 399, 547, 258, 1, 624, 1940, 6, 8, 3079, 11951, 1, 30, 1264]",1210.0,16301525,Inactivation Snf5 suppressor stimulates cycle progression cooperates p53 loss oncogenic transformation,8,0.041237113402061855
Mutually exclusive cyclin-dependent kinase 4/cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6/cyclin D2 pairing inactivates retinoblastoma protein and promotes cell cycle dysregulation in multiple myeloma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2005-12-01,"Multiple myeloma, the second most common hematopoietic cancer, ultimately becomes refractory to treatment when self-renewing multiple myeloma cells begin unrestrained proliferation by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that one, but not more than one, of the three early G(1) D cyclins is elevated in each case of multiple myeloma. Cyclin D1 or D3 expression does not vary in the clinical course, but that alone is insufficient to promote cell cycle progression unless cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) is also elevated, in the absence of cdk6, to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). By contrast, cyclin D2 and cdk6 are coordinately increased, thereby overriding the inhibition by cdk inhibitors p18(INK4c) and p27(Kip1) and phosphorylating Rb in conjunction with the existing cdk4. Thus, cyclin D1 pairs exclusively with cdk4 and cdk6 pairs only with cyclin D2, although cyclin D2 can also pair with cdk4 in multiple myeloma cells. The basis for this novel and specific cdk/D cyclin pairing lies in differential transcriptional activation. In addition, cyclin D1- or cyclin D3-expressing multiple myeloma cells are uniformly distributed in the bone marrow, whereas cdk6-specific phosphorylation of Rb occurs in discrete foci of bone marrow multiple myeloma cells before proliferation early in the clinical course and is then heightened with proliferation and disease progression. Mutually exclusive cdk4/cyclin D1 and cdk6/cyclin D2 pairing, therefore, is likely to be a critical determinant for cell cycle reentry and progression and may play a pivotal role in the expansion of self-renewing multiple myeloma cells.",Comparative Study,5164.0,86.0,Multiple myeloma second common hematopoietic ultimately refractory treatment self-renewing multiple myeloma begin unrestrained proliferation unknown mechanisms early G 1 cyclins elevated case multiple myeloma Cyclin D1 D3 expression vary clinical course insufficient promote cycle progression cyclin-dependent kinase 4 cdk4 elevated absence cdk6 phosphorylate retinoblastoma Rb contrast cyclin D2 cdk6 coordinately increased overriding inhibition cdk inhibitors p18 INK4c p27 Kip1 phosphorylating Rb conjunction existing cdk4 cyclin D1 pairs exclusively cdk4 cdk6 pairs cyclin D2 cyclin D2 pair cdk4 multiple myeloma basis novel specific cdk/D cyclin pairing lies differential transcriptional activation addition cyclin D1- cyclin D3-expressing multiple myeloma uniformly distributed bone marrow cdk6-specific phosphorylation Rb occurs discrete foci bone marrow multiple myeloma proliferation early clinical course heightened proliferation disease progression Mutually exclusive cdk4/cyclin D1 cdk6/cyclin D2 pairing likely critical determinant cycle reentry progression play pivotal role expansion self-renewing multiple myeloma,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 3, 419, 96, 186, 1007, 12, 2050, 5366, 430, 6, 24, 198, 1074, 13350, 232, 37, 6886, 30886, 457, 20, 860, 483, 467, 21, 514, 17, 104, 84, 44, 80, 76, 104, 1, 3, 169, 191, 499, 14, 427, 10149, 16, 804, 4, 296, 473, 1, 232, 1226, 2146, 15, 6037, 55, 1097, 44, 2825, 4, 3, 38, 906, 84, 17, 279, 16, 3027, 6, 1617, 31, 417, 91, 6179, 1226, 470, 216, 39, 3254, 16, 120, 804, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 9518, 6, 14099, 3, 178, 2955, 20, 748, 1226, 4171, 2, 9518, 32, 13845, 101, 2267, 23487, 3, 297, 20, 3954, 222, 15465, 19052, 2, 2804, 5584, 2, 26461, 2955, 4, 3357, 5, 3, 1692, 3254, 631, 1226, 2146, 2773, 4437, 5, 3254, 2, 9518, 2773, 158, 5, 1226, 4171, 242, 1226, 4171, 122, 120, 4767, 5, 3254, 4, 232, 37, 3, 877, 9, 26, 229, 2, 112, 3954, 427, 1226, 19737, 9247, 4, 1777, 1431, 363, 4, 352, 1226, 2146, 15, 1226, 6037, 1046, 232, 37, 32, 4254, 4737, 4, 3, 581, 547, 9518, 112, 982, 1, 2955, 1780, 4, 5447, 3340, 1, 581, 232, 37, 348, 457, 191, 4, 3, 38, 906, 2, 16, 818, 7145, 5, 457, 2, 34, 91, 5575, 4804, 3254, 1226, 2146, 2, 9518, 1226, 4171, 19737, 673, 16, 322, 6, 40, 8, 740, 4372, 9, 31, 417, 55202, 2, 91, 2, 68, 1343, 8, 3754, 200, 4, 3, 1422, 1, 1074, 13350, 232, 37]",1514.0,16357141,Mutually exclusive cyclin-dependent kinase 4/cyclin D1 cyclin-dependent kinase 6/cyclin D2 pairing inactivates retinoblastoma promotes cycle dysregulation multiple myeloma,7,0.03608247422680412
A proposal for an international retinoblastoma staging system.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2006-11-01,"Although intra-retinal tumor has long been staged presurgically according to the Reese-Ellsworth (R-E) system, retinoblastoma differs from other pediatric neoplasms in never having had a widely accepted classification system that encompasses the entire spectrum of the disease.

"AZ703, an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2, induces E2F-1-dependent apoptosis enhanced by depletion of cyclin-dependent kinase 9.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"Preclinical studies were performed of a novel selective imidazopyridine cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, AZ703. In vitro kinase assays showed that IC50 values for AZ703 against purified cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin B/cdk1 were 34 and 29 nmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the IC50 against cdk4 was 10 micromol/L. AZ703 also inhibited cdk7 and cdk9 with IC50 values of 2.1 micromol/L and 521 nmol/L, respectively. Treatment of U2OS, NCI-H1299, and A549 cells for 24 hours resulted in growth arrest involving multiple cell cycle phases. At low drug concentrations (< 2 micromol/L), G2 arrest predominated, whereas at higher concentrations (> or = 2 micromol/L), S-G2 arrest was observed. When cells were synchronized in G1 by starvation and released into AZ703, a block in G1 occurred that was not evident in exponentially growing cells. Cell cycle arrest was associated with reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and p27(Kip1) at cdk2 phospho-sites. Following longer exposures, apoptosis was evident. Cells were further sensitized to AZ703 following recruitment to S phase by synchronization. Consistent with the inhibition of cdks during S and G2 that modulate the activity and stability of E2F-1, AZ703 treatment induced E2F-1 expression. In U2OS and NCI-H1299 cells engineered to inducibly express the dominant-negative mutant E2F-1 (1-374), expression of the mutant decreased AZ703-mediated apoptosis, indicating dependence on E2F-1 transcriptional targets. AZ703-induced apoptosis in NCI-H1299 cells was enhanced by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of cdk9, which caused reduced levels of Mcl-1 and XIAP, suggesting that cdk2, cdk1, and cdk9 represent a rational subset of family members for drug targeting.",Journal Article,5133.0,67.0,Preclinical studies performed novel selective imidazopyridine cyclin-dependent kinase cdk inhibitor AZ703 vitro kinase showed IC50 values AZ703 purified cyclin E/cdk2 cyclin B/cdk1 34 29 nmol/L respectively contrast IC50 cdk4 10 micromol/L AZ703 inhibited cdk7 cdk9 IC50 values 2.1 micromol/L 521 nmol/L respectively Treatment U2OS NCI-H1299 A549 24 hours resulted growth arrest involving multiple cycle phases low drug concentrations 2 micromol/L G2 arrest predominated higher concentrations 2 micromol/L S-G2 arrest observed synchronized G1 starvation released AZ703 block G1 occurred evident exponentially growing cycle arrest associated reduced phosphorylation retinoblastoma p27 Kip1 cdk2 phospho-sites Following longer exposures apoptosis evident sensitized AZ703 following recruitment phase synchronization Consistent inhibition cdks G2 modulate activity stability E2F-1 AZ703 treatment induced E2F-1 expression U2OS NCI-H1299 engineered inducibly express dominant-negative E2F-1 1-374 expression decreased AZ703-mediated apoptosis indicating dependence E2F-1 transcriptional targets AZ703-induced apoptosis NCI-H1299 enhanced small interfering RNA-mediated depletion cdk9 caused reduced levels Mcl-1 XIAP suggesting cdk2 cdk1 cdk9 represent rational subset family members drug targeting,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[693, 94, 11, 173, 1, 8, 229, 1094, 55244, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 230, 24881, 4, 439, 216, 1013, 224, 17, 5211, 1030, 9, 24881, 480, 5963, 1226, 563, 4547, 2, 1226, 132, 7111, 11, 562, 2, 462, 4694, 805, 106, 4, 748, 3, 5211, 480, 3254, 10, 79, 6297, 805, 24881, 120, 879, 19055, 2, 11333, 5, 5211, 1030, 1, 18, 14, 6297, 805, 2, 11925, 4694, 805, 106, 24, 1, 18445, 2580, 8919, 2, 4105, 37, 9, 259, 1459, 627, 4, 129, 1854, 1267, 232, 31, 417, 3523, 28, 154, 234, 1003, 18, 6297, 805, 3774, 1854, 16244, 547, 28, 142, 1003, 15, 18, 6297, 805, 695, 3774, 1854, 10, 164, 198, 37, 11, 18278, 4, 3344, 20, 13315, 2, 5394, 237, 24881, 8, 2381, 4, 3344, 489, 17, 10, 44, 2853, 4, 16859, 1921, 37, 31, 417, 1854, 10, 41, 5, 405, 982, 1, 3, 178, 2, 2804, 5584, 28, 4547, 3125, 633, 366, 589, 3401, 351, 10, 2853, 37, 11, 195, 4242, 6, 24881, 366, 3202, 6, 695, 124, 20, 27869, 925, 5, 3, 297, 1, 9336, 190, 695, 2, 3774, 17, 3319, 3, 128, 2, 2769, 1, 5391, 14, 24881, 24, 277, 5391, 14, 55, 4, 18445, 2, 2580, 8919, 37, 2794, 6, 26188, 1669, 3, 2156, 199, 620, 5391, 14, 14, 10349, 55, 1, 3, 620, 340, 24881, 517, 351, 1716, 3721, 23, 5391, 14, 1431, 637, 24881, 277, 351, 4, 2580, 8919, 37, 10, 651, 20, 302, 3449, 893, 517, 2286, 1, 11333, 92, 1546, 405, 148, 1, 1308, 14, 2, 5387, 802, 17, 4547, 7111, 2, 11333, 1231, 8, 2696, 697, 1, 607, 1684, 9, 234, 529]",1678.0,16397259,"AZ703 imidazo 1,2-a pyridine inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinases 1 2 induces E2F-1-dependent apoptosis enhanced depletion cyclin-dependent kinase 9",0,0.0
Immunohistochemical detection of multidrug-resistant protein expression in retinoblastoma treated by primary enucleation.,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.,2006-04-01,"To compare the expression of multidrug-resistant proteins in retinoblastoma tumors among eyes treated with primary enucleation. A group of 18 patients with unilateral retinoblastoma with advanced intraocular disease was selected for the study. All patients had undergone primary enucleation. A histologic specimen from each patient was retrieved from the pathology archives and a tissue gene microarray was constructed (0.6 x 3-4 mm). Standard immunohistochemical techniques were used to study the tissue microarrays for the expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2), multidrug-resistant protein 1/P-glycoprotein (MDR1/Pgp; ABCB1), multidrug-resistant-associated protein 1 (MRP1; ABCC1), MRP2 (ABCC2), and MRP4 (ABCC4). Of the 18 specimens retrieved, 16 had adequate tissue for study. MRP1 was expressed in 8 (50%) of 16 tumors, and MRP2 was expressed in 5 (31%) of 16 tumors. MDR1/Pgp was found in 2 (12%) of 16 retinoblastomas. MRP4 and BCRP were not detected in any of the tumors studied.

The Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 induces endoreduplication and apoptosis preferentially in cells with compromised p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint function.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-08-01,"VX-680 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases that induces the accumulation of cells with > or =4N DNA content, followed by cell death. Here, we define the role of p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) in cell cycle perturbations following exposure to VX-680. Endoreduplication and apoptosis in response to VX-680 are limited in A549 and MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type p53, and markedly enhanced in cells lacking p53, including those engineered to express the HPV16-E6 oncoprotein or short interfering RNA pools targeting p53. In contrast, endoreduplication and apoptosis occur in the p53 wild-type cell lines, RKO and U2OS. The difference in response to VX-680 among these cell lines correlates with the timing of induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and its ability to inhibit cyclin E-cdk2 activity. In A549 cells, VX-680 induces the expression of p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) within 24 hours, with consequent inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2, and reduction of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, limiting endoreduplication. In RKO and U2OS cells, the induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) is delayed and associated with higher residual cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, followed by progressive endoreduplication and apoptosis. Abrogation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression by short interfering RNA targeting in A549 cells results in a substantial increase in the degree of endoreduplication, whereas inducible expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) in p53-negative NCI-H1299 cells inhibits VX-680-induced endoreduplication and cell death. These data suggest that the integrity of the p53-p21(Waf1/Cip1)-dependent postmitotic checkpoint governs the response to Aurora kinase inhibition. Although cells with intact checkpoint function arrest with 4N DNA content, those with compromised checkpoint function are more likely to undergo endoreduplication followed by eventual apoptosis.",Journal Article,4921.0,150.0,VX-680 potent inhibitor Aurora kinases induces accumulation =4N DNA content followed death define role p53 p21 Waf1/Cip1 cycle perturbations following exposure VX-680 Endoreduplication apoptosis response VX-680 limited A549 MCF-7 expressing wild-type p53 markedly enhanced lacking p53 including engineered express HPV16-E6 oncoprotein short interfering RNA pools targeting p53 contrast endoreduplication apoptosis occur p53 wild-type lines RKO U2OS difference response VX-680 lines correlates timing induction p21 Waf1/Cip1 ability inhibit cyclin E-cdk2 activity A549 VX-680 induces expression p53 p21 Waf1/Cip1 24 hours consequent inhibition cyclin E-cdk2 reduction retinoblastoma phosphorylation limiting endoreduplication RKO U2OS induction p21 Waf1/Cip1 delayed associated higher residual cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity retinoblastoma phosphorylation followed progressive endoreduplication apoptosis Abrogation p21 Waf1/Cip1 expression short interfering RNA targeting A549 substantial increase degree endoreduplication inducible expression p21 Waf1/Cip1 p53-negative NCI-H1299 inhibits VX-680-induced endoreduplication death suggest integrity p53-p21 Waf1/Cip1 -dependent postmitotic checkpoint governs response Aurora kinase inhibition intact checkpoint function arrest 4N DNA content compromised checkpoint function likely undergo endoreduplication followed eventual apoptosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9009, 9297, 16, 8, 1157, 230, 1, 4095, 1549, 17, 1516, 3, 1835, 1, 37, 5, 15, 22181, 261, 2457, 370, 20, 31, 273, 467, 21, 1107, 3, 200, 1, 624, 2, 2657, 7858, 6927, 4, 31, 417, 7013, 366, 645, 6, 9009, 9297, 23543, 2, 351, 4, 51, 6, 9009, 9297, 32, 383, 4, 4105, 2, 3252, 67, 37, 1046, 955, 267, 624, 2, 2195, 651, 4, 37, 1941, 624, 141, 135, 2794, 6, 1669, 3, 4048, 4837, 6159, 15, 978, 3449, 893, 9090, 529, 624, 4, 748, 23543, 2, 351, 1271, 4, 3, 624, 955, 267, 31, 285, 11736, 2, 18445, 3, 523, 4, 51, 6, 9009, 9297, 107, 46, 31, 285, 1871, 5, 3, 1972, 1, 504, 1, 2657, 7858, 6927, 2, 211, 801, 6, 1433, 1226, 563, 4547, 128, 4, 4105, 37, 9009, 9297, 1516, 3, 55, 1, 624, 2, 2657, 7858, 6927, 262, 259, 1459, 5, 8436, 297, 1, 1226, 563, 4547, 2, 628, 1, 178, 982, 817, 23543, 4, 11736, 2, 18445, 37, 3, 504, 1, 2657, 7858, 6927, 16, 1612, 2, 41, 5, 142, 753, 1226, 563, 4547, 216, 128, 2, 178, 982, 370, 20, 1014, 23543, 2, 351, 8589, 1, 2657, 7858, 6927, 55, 20, 978, 3449, 893, 529, 4, 4105, 37, 99, 4, 8, 1281, 344, 4, 3, 1444, 1, 23543, 547, 2877, 55, 1, 2657, 7858, 6927, 4, 624, 199, 2580, 8919, 37, 1576, 9009, 9297, 277, 23543, 2, 31, 273, 46, 74, 309, 17, 3, 4797, 1, 3, 624, 2657, 7858, 6927, 470, 38228, 986, 23544, 3, 51, 6, 4095, 216, 297, 242, 37, 5, 2964, 986, 343, 1854, 5, 22181, 261, 2457, 135, 5, 4867, 986, 343, 32, 80, 322, 6, 1251, 23543, 370, 20, 6956, 351]",1808.0,16885368,Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 induces endoreduplication apoptosis preferentially compromised p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint function,0,0.0
Risk factors for extraocular relapse following enucleation after failure of chemoreduction in retinoblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-09-01,"To assess the outcome and determine risk factors for extraocular relapse in patients with retinoblastoma who had been enucleated after failure of chemoreduction. Retrospective study (1995-2002) at three institutions. Pathological risk factors (PRF) were defined as invasion of the anterior segment, choroid, post-laminar optic nerve, subarachnoid space, or sclera according to the local pathology report. Extraocular relapse was defined as an event. One hundred twenty-two patients were included (17 had bilateral enucleation). Chemoreduction included vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide (n=80, 65.6%), vincristine, and carboplatin (n=17, 13.9%), or carboplatin (n=25, 20.5%). Thirty-five also received external beam radiotherapy (28.7%). PRF included: 39 with choroidal involvement, 9 with anterior segment, 9 with scleral, and 2 with post-laminar optic nerve with subarachnoid invasion. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to eight patients (6.5%) because of scleral invasion.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor modifies the therapeutic response of breast cancer.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2006-12-07,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) protein is functionally inactivated in the majority of human cancers and is aberrant in one-third of all breast cancers. RB regulates G(1)/S-phase cell-cycle progression and is a critical mediator of antiproliferative signaling. Here the specific impact of RB deficiency on E2F-regulated gene expression, tumorigenic proliferation, and the response to 2 distinct lines of therapy was investigated in breast cancer cells. RB knockdown resulted in RB/E2F target gene deregulation and accelerated tumorigenic proliferation, thereby demonstrating that even in the context of a complex tumor cell genome, RB status exerts significant control over proliferation. Furthermore, the RB deficiency compromised the short-term cell-cycle inhibition following cisplatin, ionizing radiation, and antiestrogen therapy. In the context of DNA-damaging agents, this bypass resulted in increased sensitivity to these agents in cell culture and xenograft models. In contrast, the bypass of antiestrogen signaling resulted in continued proliferation and xenograft tumor growth in the presence of tamoxifen. These effects of aberrations in RB function were recapitulated by ectopic E2F expression, indicating that control of downstream target genes was an important determinant of the observed responses. Specific analyses of an RB gene expression signature in 60 human patients indicated that deregulation of this pathway was associated with early recurrence following tamoxifen monotherapy. Thus, because the RB pathway is a critical determinant of tumorigenic proliferation and differential therapeutic response, it may represent a critical basis for directing therapy in the treatment of breast cancer.",Journal Article,4793.0,139.0,retinoblastoma suppressor RB functionally inactivated majority human aberrant one-third breast RB regulates G 1 /S-phase cell-cycle progression critical mediator antiproliferative signaling specific impact RB deficiency E2F-regulated expression tumorigenic proliferation response 2 distinct lines therapy investigated breast RB knockdown resulted RB/E2F target deregulation accelerated tumorigenic proliferation demonstrating context complex genome RB status exerts significant control proliferation Furthermore RB deficiency compromised short-term cell-cycle inhibition following cisplatin ionizing radiation antiestrogen therapy context DNA-damaging agents bypass resulted increased sensitivity agents culture xenograft models contrast bypass antiestrogen signaling resulted continued proliferation xenograft growth presence tamoxifen effects aberrations RB function recapitulated ectopic E2F expression indicating control downstream target important determinant observed responses Specific RB expression signature 60 human patients indicated deregulation pathway associated early recurrence following tamoxifen monotherapy RB pathway critical determinant tumorigenic proliferation differential therapeutic response represent critical basis directing therapy treatment breast,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 30, 1245, 2955, 178, 16, 3772, 5458, 4, 3, 686, 1, 171, 163, 2, 16, 1898, 4, 104, 1282, 1, 62, 163, 2955, 2468, 499, 14, 695, 124, 31, 417, 91, 2, 16, 8, 740, 3810, 1, 3669, 314, 467, 3, 112, 345, 1, 2955, 2299, 23, 5391, 1065, 145, 55, 3795, 457, 2, 3, 51, 6, 18, 834, 285, 1, 36, 10, 565, 4, 12, 37, 2955, 1563, 627, 4, 2955, 5391, 283, 145, 4765, 2, 2241, 3795, 457, 2267, 2219, 17, 871, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 8, 840, 30, 31, 898, 2955, 156, 5685, 93, 182, 252, 457, 798, 3, 2955, 2299, 4867, 3, 978, 337, 31, 417, 297, 366, 540, 4341, 121, 2, 7724, 36, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 261, 4904, 183, 26, 5481, 627, 4, 101, 485, 6, 46, 183, 4, 31, 2099, 2, 1330, 274, 4, 748, 3, 5481, 1, 7724, 314, 627, 4, 1351, 457, 2, 1330, 30, 129, 4, 3, 463, 1, 1105, 46, 176, 1, 2152, 4, 2955, 343, 11, 8064, 20, 3647, 5391, 55, 1716, 17, 182, 1, 1489, 283, 214, 10, 35, 305, 4372, 1, 3, 164, 253, 112, 318, 1, 35, 2955, 145, 55, 1651, 4, 335, 171, 7, 1103, 17, 4765, 1, 26, 308, 10, 41, 5, 191, 146, 366, 1105, 1411, 631, 408, 3, 2955, 308, 16, 8, 740, 4372, 1, 3795, 457, 2, 1777, 189, 51, 192, 68, 1231, 8, 740, 877, 9, 11321, 36, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1665.0,17160137,retinoblastoma suppressor modifies therapeutic response breast,2,0.010309278350515464
HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir inhibits growth of human melanoma cells by induction of cell cycle arrest.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-02-01,"HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PI) are a class of antiretroviral drugs that are designed to target the viral protease. Unexpectedly, this class of drugs is also reported to have antitumor activity. In this study, we have evaluated the in vitro activity of nelfinavir, a HIV PI, against human melanoma cells. Nelfinavir inhibits the growth of melanoma cell lines at low micromolar concentrations that are clinically attainable. Nelfinavir promotes apoptosis and arrests cell cycle at G(1) phase. Cell cycle arrest is attributed to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and concomitant dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor.

Carboplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens in conjunction with local therapies have been investigated for intraocular retinoblastoma, but the lack of data regarding the efficacy of single agent intravenous carboplatin prompted this phase II study. Twenty-five patients (43 eyes) were treated with intravenous carboplatin (18.7 mg/kg for patients < 12 kg, 560 mg/m(2) for patients >/= 12 kg). Patients received a median of two cycles of carboplatin (range one to five cycles) beginning at a median age of 5 months (range 14 days to 22 months). All patients were extraocular disease free during the follow-up period (median 76.3 months). Responses were noted in 33 of 36 evaluable eyes (92%). The 5-year overall ocular and ocular event-free survivals were 93.3% (95% CI, 84.4-100%) and 43.5% (95% CI, 25.8-61.3%) for eyes treated for Reese-Ellsworth (RE) group 1-3 disease and 25.0% (95% CI, 1.0-50.0%) and 8.3% (95% CI, 0-24.0%) for RE group 4-5 disease, respectively. No non-hematopoietic serious or permanent toxicities related to the chemotherapy were observed. When used as a neoadjuvant agent, carboplatin usually leads to objective responses of intraocular retinoblastoma.

Tumor-specific cooperation of retinoblastoma protein family and Snf5 inactivation.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-04-01,"Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are rare aggressive cancers that occur in young children. Seventy-five percent of sporadic MRTs harbor inactivating SNF5 mutations, and mice heterozygous for an Snf5-null allele develop MRTs with partial penetrance. The diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) in addition to MRTs in families with a single mutant SNF5 allele prompted us to assess the role of SNF5 loss in CPC in genetically engineered mice. With high frequency, TgT(121) mice develop CPCs that are initiated by inactivation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and related proteins p107 and p130. However, CPC penetrance and latency were not significantly affected by Snf5 heterozygosity, consistent with recent evidence that CPCs in SNF5 families were, in many cases, misdiagnosed MRTs. Surprisingly, although the CPC phenotype was unaffected, TgT(121);Snf5(+/-) mice developed MRTs with increased penetrance and decreased latency compared with TgT(121);Snf5(+/+) littermates. MRTs expressed the T(121) protein with a concomitant increase in mitotic activity.

"Erlotinib, an effective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induces p27KIP1 up-regulation and nuclear translocation in association with cell growth inhibition and G1/S phase arrest in human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines.",Molecular pharmacology,Mol. Pharmacol.,2007-04-24,"Erlotinib, a small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have potent antitumor effects against human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell growth; however, the mechanism of such an effect is not elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that erlotinib-induced cell growth inhibition in EGFR high-expressing human H322 NSCLC cells was accompanied by G1/S phase arrest, which was largely caused by a decrease in expression of G1/S-related cyclins, suppression of activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and CDK4, induction of CDK inhibitor p27(KIP1), and retinoblastoma hypophosphorylation. To further understand the role of p27(KIP1) in G1/S arrest and cell growth inhibition by erlotinib, we determined its effect on the expression of p27(KIP1) at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Studies using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and p27 promoter-driven luciferase reporter showed that erlotinib treatment resulted in the promotion of p27 gene transcription. In addition, erlotinib treatment led to an increase in p27(KIP1) half-life by inhibiting p27(KIP1) phosphorylation at Thr187 and by down-regulating Skp2 expression. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining and cell fractionation showed that erlotinib treatment led to p27(KIP1) translocation to the nucleus. Knockdown of p27(KIP1) expression with p27(KIP1) small interfering RNA significantly abrogated erlotinib-induced G1 phase arrest and cell growth inhibition, suggesting that induction of p27(KIP1) is required for G1 arrest and cell growth inhibition by erlotinib. It is noteworthy that we found that G1 arrest and p27(KIP1) up-regulation by erlotinib occurred in the tested sensitive cell lines but to a lesser extent in the resistant cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest that erlotinib inhibits human NSCLC cell growth predominantly by inducing p27(KIP1) expression and by suppressing cell-cycle events involved in the G1/S transition.",Journal Article,4655.0,67.0,Erlotinib small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor shown potent antitumor effects human non-small-cell lung NSCLC growth mechanism effect elucidated demonstrate erlotinib-induced growth inhibition EGFR high-expressing human H322 NSCLC accompanied G1/S phase arrest largely caused decrease expression G1/S-related cyclins suppression activities cyclin-dependent kinase CDK 2 CDK4 induction CDK inhibitor p27 KIP1 retinoblastoma hypophosphorylation understand role p27 KIP1 G1/S arrest growth inhibition erlotinib determined effect expression p27 KIP1 transcriptional posttranscriptional levels Studies real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction p27 promoter-driven luciferase reporter showed erlotinib treatment resulted promotion p27 transcription addition erlotinib treatment led increase p27 KIP1 half-life inhibiting p27 KIP1 phosphorylation Thr187 down-regulating Skp2 expression Furthermore immunofluorescence staining fractionation showed erlotinib treatment led p27 KIP1 translocation nucleus Knockdown p27 KIP1 expression p27 KIP1 small interfering RNA significantly abrogated erlotinib-induced G1 phase arrest growth inhibition suggesting induction p27 KIP1 required G1 arrest growth inhibition erlotinib noteworthy G1 arrest p27 KIP1 up-regulation erlotinib occurred tested sensitive lines lesser extent resistant lines Taken suggest erlotinib inhibits human NSCLC growth predominantly inducing p27 KIP1 expression suppressing cell-cycle events involved G1/S transition,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[962, 8, 302, 1354, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 564, 216, 230, 71, 85, 443, 6, 47, 1157, 579, 176, 480, 171, 220, 302, 31, 12, 304, 31, 129, 137, 3, 670, 1, 225, 35, 254, 16, 44, 3901, 467, 21, 608, 17, 962, 277, 31, 129, 297, 4, 227, 64, 1046, 171, 16746, 304, 37, 10, 2756, 20, 3344, 695, 124, 1854, 92, 10, 1733, 1546, 20, 8, 775, 4, 55, 1, 3344, 695, 139, 10149, 1332, 1, 2042, 1, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 18, 2, 3254, 504, 1, 3954, 230, 2804, 5584, 2, 21052, 6, 195, 1640, 3, 200, 1, 2804, 5584, 4, 3344, 695, 1854, 2, 31, 129, 297, 20, 962, 21, 509, 211, 254, 23, 3, 55, 1, 2804, 5584, 28, 1431, 2, 14386, 148, 94, 75, 1589, 98, 1772, 866, 1451, 1260, 1329, 65, 2, 2804, 973, 1621, 3864, 3674, 224, 17, 962, 24, 627, 4, 3, 5478, 1, 2804, 145, 866, 4, 352, 962, 24, 836, 6, 35, 344, 4, 2804, 5584, 1303, 358, 20, 2062, 2804, 5584, 982, 28, 43814, 2, 20, 1328, 2681, 7011, 55, 798, 4130, 1029, 2, 31, 3519, 224, 17, 962, 24, 836, 6, 2804, 5584, 2006, 6, 3, 4262, 1563, 1, 2804, 5584, 55, 5, 2804, 5584, 302, 3449, 893, 97, 3728, 962, 277, 3344, 124, 1854, 2, 31, 129, 297, 802, 17, 504, 1, 2804, 5584, 16, 616, 9, 3344, 1854, 2, 31, 129, 297, 20, 962, 192, 16, 9559, 17, 21, 204, 17, 3344, 1854, 2, 2804, 5584, 126, 863, 20, 962, 489, 4, 3, 650, 745, 31, 285, 84, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 4, 3, 436, 31, 285, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 962, 1576, 171, 304, 31, 129, 2117, 20, 1958, 2804, 5584, 55, 2, 20, 4669, 31, 417, 281, 646, 4, 3, 3344, 695, 1970]",1957.0,17456787,Erlotinib effective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor induces p27KIP1 up-regulation nuclear translocation association growth inhibition G1/S phase arrest human non-small-cell lung lines,0,0.0
Impairments in antifolate transport are common in retinoblastoma tumor samples.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008-03-01,"Many patients with retinoblastoma have a genetic predisposition to cancer and external beam radiation therapy and alkylating agent chemotherapy may increase their risk of secondary malignancy. Identification of effective chemotherapy agents for retinoblastoma that are not associated with an elevated risk of secondary malignancy would be beneficial. Twenty-six specimens of fresh retinoblastoma tumor cells were studied in vitro with a PT430 competitive displacement assay. Differential displacement of the PT430 by methotrexate and not trimetrexate was considered indicative of a defect in reduced folate carrier (RFC)-mediated transport. Elevations in the accumulation of PT430 were considered indicative of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) amplification. In 9 of the 26 (35%) samples, displacement by methotrexate was less than half the displacement by trimetrexate indicative of a defect in the RFC. In 5 of the 26 (19%) samples, trimetrexate did not displace the PT430. In 7 of 26 (27%) samples, the peak PT430 accumulation was suggestive of DHFR overexpression. Overall 9 of 26 (35%) samples had no evidence of a transport defect or DHFR overexpression and would be anticipated to be potentially sensitive to methotrexate. In 15 of the 26 (58%), no defects existed in trimetrexate displacement or DHFR overexpression and would be anticipated to be potentially sensitive to trimetrexate.

Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor status is a critical determinant of therapeutic response in prostate cancer cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-07-01,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB), a critical mediator of cell cycle progression, is functionally inactivated in the majority of human cancers, including prostatic adenocarcinoma. The importance of RB tumor suppressor function in this disease is evident because 25% to 50% of prostatic adenocarcinomas harbor aberrations in RB pathway. However, no previous studies challenged the consequence of RB inactivation on tumor cell proliferation or therapeutic response. Here, we show that RB depletion facilitates deregulation of specific E2F target genes, but does not confer a significant proliferative advantage in the presence of androgen. However, RB-deficient cells failed to elicit a cytostatic response (compared with RB proficient isogenic controls) when challenged with androgen ablation, AR antagonist, or combined androgen blockade. These data indicate that RB deficiency can facilitate bypass of first-line hormonal therapies used to treat prostate cancer. Given the established effect of RB on DNA damage checkpoints, these studies were then extended to determine the impact of RB depletion on the response to cytotoxic agents used to treat advanced disease. In this context, RB-deficient prostate cancer cells showed enhanced susceptibility to cell death induced by only a selected subset of cytotoxic agents (antimicrotubule agents and a topoisomerase inhibitor). Combined, these data indicate that RB depletion dramatically alters the cellular response to therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer cells and suggest that RB status could potentially be developed as a marker for effectively directing therapy.",Journal Article,4587.0,55.0,retinoblastoma suppressor RB critical mediator cycle progression functionally inactivated majority human including prostatic adenocarcinoma importance RB suppressor function disease evident 25 50 prostatic adenocarcinomas harbor aberrations RB pathway previous studies challenged consequence RB inactivation proliferation therapeutic response RB depletion facilitates deregulation specific E2F target confer significant proliferative advantage presence androgen RB-deficient failed elicit cytostatic response compared RB proficient isogenic controls challenged androgen ablation AR antagonist combined androgen blockade indicate RB deficiency facilitate bypass first-line hormonal therapies treat prostate Given established effect RB DNA damage checkpoints studies extended determine impact RB depletion response cytotoxic agents treat advanced disease context RB-deficient prostate showed enhanced susceptibility death induced selected subset cytotoxic agents antimicrotubule agents topoisomerase inhibitor Combined indicate RB depletion dramatically alters cellular response therapeutic intervention prostate suggest RB status potentially developed marker effectively directing therapy,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 30, 1245, 178, 2955, 8, 740, 3810, 1, 31, 417, 91, 16, 3772, 5458, 4, 3, 686, 1, 171, 163, 141, 3329, 449, 3, 1187, 1, 2955, 30, 1245, 343, 4, 26, 34, 16, 2853, 408, 243, 6, 212, 1, 3329, 1586, 2760, 2152, 4, 2955, 308, 137, 77, 698, 94, 6389, 3, 4177, 1, 2955, 2297, 23, 30, 31, 457, 15, 189, 51, 467, 21, 514, 17, 2955, 2286, 4936, 4765, 1, 112, 5391, 283, 214, 84, 1097, 44, 2913, 8, 93, 2441, 1874, 4, 3, 463, 1, 687, 137, 2955, 1971, 37, 1551, 6, 5487, 8, 8154, 51, 72, 5, 2955, 5550, 7208, 535, 198, 6389, 5, 687, 1650, 754, 3137, 15, 397, 687, 1189, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 2955, 2299, 122, 1876, 5481, 1, 157, 328, 1761, 235, 95, 6, 943, 12, 447, 3, 635, 254, 1, 2955, 23, 261, 1350, 4704, 46, 94, 11, 818, 1747, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 2955, 2286, 23, 3, 51, 6, 759, 183, 95, 6, 943, 131, 34, 4, 26, 1533, 2955, 1971, 12, 37, 224, 651, 1432, 6, 31, 273, 277, 20, 158, 8, 715, 697, 1, 759, 183, 16314, 183, 2, 8, 3999, 230, 397, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 2955, 2286, 2729, 6745, 3, 763, 51, 6, 189, 788, 4, 12, 37, 2, 309, 17, 2955, 156, 359, 751, 40, 276, 22, 8, 952, 9, 1856, 11321, 36]",1565.0,17616676,Retinoblastoma suppressor status critical determinant therapeutic response prostate,0,0.0
Clinical proton radiation therapy research at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center.,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Technol. Cancer Res. Treat.,2007-08-01,"The Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center has a 230 MeV cyclotron from which proton beams are directed to two isocentric gantries, a stereotactic intracranial beam line, and an eye line. Because of improved physical dose distribution, proton radiotherapy allows dose escalation to improve local tumor control in anatomic sites and histologies where local control is suboptimal with photons. The improved dose localization also reduces normal-tissue doses with an anticipated reduction in acute and late toxicity. Clinical treatment protocols, developed to exploit the dosimetric advantages of protons over photons, have been grouped into two broad categories. In the first, dose is escalated for anatomic sites where local control with conventional radiation doses has been suboptimal. In the second, normal-tissue sparing with protons is designed to minimize acute and late toxicity. Treatment of patients on clinical research protocols has been encouraged. Patient treatments began on the first gantry in November 2001; on the eye line in April 2002; on the second gantry in May 2002; and on the stereotactic intracranial line in August 2006. The facility currently treats 60 patients per day, including up to six children daily under anesthesia. Dose-escalation studies have been completed for early stage prostate cancer (in conjunction with Loma Linda University) and sarcomas of the cervical spine/base of skull and thoracolumbosacral spine. Protocols are in progress or development for carcinoma of the nasopharynx, paranasal sinus carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Studies evaluating the use of protons for morbidity reduction include protocols for craniospinal irradiation in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma, other pediatric sarcomas, and accelerated, hypofractionated partial breast irradiation for T1N0 breast carcinomas. For pediatric patients, protons have also been accepted as an alternative to photons for children enrolled in Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Treatment of patients on these studies has often required the development of new treatment techniques (i.e., matching abutting fields for craniospinal irradiation), respiratory gating, and development of appropriate clinical infrastructure support (i.e., increase in availability of pediatric anesthesia) to allow appropriate treatment. In addition, a clinical research infrastructure for protocol development and data management is required. Results to date indicate that proton radiation therapy offers several potential treatment advantages to patients that can be studied in the setting of clinical trials. Patients' willingness to enter these clinical trials seems to be quite high; accrual to selected studies has been favorable.",Journal Article,4556.0,17.0,Francis H.

ICOVIR-5 shows E2F1 addiction and potent antiglioma effect in vivo.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-09-01,"During 2007, approximately 200,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with brain tumors. Gliomas account for 77% of primary malignant brain tumors, and the prognosis has hardly changed in the past 20 years, with only 30% of patients with malignant glioma surviving 5 years after diagnosis. Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising therapies for the treatment of gliomas. Here, report the antiglioma activity of the tumor-selective ICOVIR-5 adenovirus, which encompasses an early 1A adenoviral (E1A) deletion in the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-binding region, substitution of the E1A promoter for E2F-responsive elements, and an RGD-4C peptide motif inserted into the adenoviral fiber to enhance adenoviral tropism. Mechanistic studies showed a dramatic addiction of ICOVIR-5 to the E2F1 oncogene in vitro and in vivo. This addiction was mediated by the occupancy of the ectopic adenoviral E2F1-responsive elements by the endogenous E2F1 protein resulting in high level of E1A expression in cancer cells and potent antiglioma effect. Importantly, we showed for the first time the ability of oncolytic adenoviruses to enhance E2F transcriptional activity in vivo, and we provided direct evidence of the interaction of the E2F1 protein with native and ectopic adenovirus promoters. Restoration of Rb function led to the association of Rb/E2F1 repressor complexes with ICOVIR-5 ectopic E2F1 promoter and subsequent down-modulation of E1A, dramatically impairing adenoviral replication. In xenografted mice, intratumoral injection of ICOVIR-5 resulted in a significant improvement of the median survival (P < 0.0001), and furthermore, led to 37% of long-term survivors free of disease. The antitumor activity of ICOVIR-5 suggests that it has the potential to be an effective agent in the treatment of gliomas.",Evaluation Study,4525.0,43.0,"2007 approximately 200,000 people United States diagnosed brain Gliomas account 77 primary malignant brain prognosis hardly changed past 20 years 30 patients malignant glioma surviving 5 years diagnosis Oncolytic adenoviruses promising therapies treatment gliomas report antiglioma activity tumor-selective ICOVIR-5 adenovirus encompasses early 1A adenoviral E1A deletion retinoblastoma Rb protein-binding region substitution E1A promoter E2F-responsive elements RGD-4C peptide motif inserted adenoviral fiber enhance adenoviral tropism Mechanistic studies showed dramatic addiction ICOVIR-5 E2F1 oncogene vitro vivo addiction mediated occupancy ectopic adenoviral E2F1-responsive elements endogenous E2F1 resulting high level E1A expression potent antiglioma effect Importantly showed time ability oncolytic adenoviruses enhance E2F transcriptional activity vivo provided direct evidence interaction E2F1 native ectopic adenovirus promoters Restoration Rb function led association Rb/E2F1 repressor complexes ICOVIR-5 ectopic E2F1 promoter subsequent down-modulation E1A dramatically impairing adenoviral replication xenografted mice intratumoral injection ICOVIR-5 resulted significant improvement median survival P 0.0001 furthermore led 37 long-term survivors free disease antitumor activity ICOVIR-5 suggests potential effective agent treatment gliomas",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[190, 1307, 705, 1250, 984, 3788, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 303, 40, 265, 5, 342, 57, 1287, 1967, 9, 849, 1, 86, 393, 342, 57, 2, 3, 356, 71, 26009, 2368, 4, 3, 1219, 179, 60, 5, 158, 201, 1, 7, 5, 393, 945, 3050, 33, 60, 50, 147, 3236, 9470, 32, 721, 235, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1287, 467, 414, 3, 14492, 128, 1, 3, 30, 1094, 28711, 33, 4488, 92, 9485, 35, 191, 6345, 4771, 6822, 1528, 4, 3, 2955, 178, 791, 1053, 5029, 1, 3, 6822, 973, 9, 5391, 2443, 2531, 2, 35, 6274, 22101, 1389, 5298, 9882, 237, 3, 4771, 5554, 6, 1304, 4771, 9237, 2716, 94, 224, 8, 3079, 8053, 1, 28711, 33, 6, 3, 6112, 1836, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 26, 8053, 10, 517, 20, 3, 8509, 1, 3, 3647, 4771, 6112, 2443, 2531, 20, 3, 2682, 6112, 178, 1113, 4, 64, 301, 1, 6822, 55, 4, 12, 37, 2, 1157, 14492, 254, 1859, 21, 224, 9, 3, 157, 98, 3, 801, 1, 3236, 9470, 6, 1304, 5391, 1431, 128, 4, 386, 2, 21, 1052, 1196, 241, 1, 3, 915, 1, 3, 6112, 178, 5, 4646, 2, 3647, 4488, 4347, 5194, 1, 2955, 343, 836, 6, 3, 248, 1, 2955, 6112, 7434, 3817, 5, 28711, 33, 3647, 6112, 973, 2, 706, 1328, 2356, 1, 6822, 2729, 12880, 4771, 2079, 4, 8047, 399, 2074, 1754, 1, 28711, 33, 627, 4, 8, 93, 767, 1, 3, 52, 25, 19, 13, 488, 2, 798, 836, 6, 567, 1, 319, 337, 332, 115, 1, 34, 3, 579, 128, 1, 28711, 33, 844, 17, 192, 71, 3, 174, 6, 40, 35, 323, 420, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1287]",1762.0,17804740,ICOVIR-5 shows E2F1 addiction potent antiglioma effect vivo,22,0.1134020618556701
Current management strategies for intraocular retinoblastoma.,Drugs,Drugs,2007-01-01,"Survival rates for retinoblastoma patients have increased dramatically over the last century, with documented 5-year survival figures reaching 87-99% in developed countries. During the last decade, there has been a dramatic paradigm shift in the treatment approach for intraocular retinoblastoma, emphasising chemoreduction protocols and minimising the use of external beam radiation. The recognition of the increased risk for second non-ocular cancers with external beam radiation contributed to the growing emergence of chemotherapy. Although chemoreduction protocols vary slightly between institutions, many centres are currently treating intraocular retinoblastoma with carboplatin, vincristine and etoposide as a three-drug regimen given in two to six cycles. Clinical studies have demonstrated that systemic chemotherapy must be combined with other modalities, such as laser treatment and cryotherapy, for adequate tumour control and many eyes with advanced intraocular disease require salvage therapy with radiation or enucleation. Therefore, modern centres treating retinoblastoma continue to manage patients with a variety of modalities, individualising the therapy according to the patient's presentation and clinical course.",Journal Article,4768.0,32.0,Survival rates retinoblastoma patients increased dramatically century documented 5-year survival reaching 87-99 developed countries decade dramatic paradigm shift treatment approach intraocular retinoblastoma emphasising chemoreduction protocols minimising use external beam radiation recognition increased risk second non-ocular external beam radiation contributed growing emergence chemotherapy chemoreduction protocols vary slightly institutions centres currently treating intraocular retinoblastoma carboplatin vincristine etoposide three-drug regimen given cycles Clinical studies demonstrated systemic chemotherapy combined modalities laser treatment cryotherapy adequate tumour control eyes advanced intraocular disease require salvage therapy radiation enucleation modern centres treating retinoblastoma continue manage patients variety modalities individualising therapy according patient 's presentation clinical course,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[25, 151, 9, 7, 47, 101, 2729, 252, 3, 1060, 7981, 5, 1405, 33, 111, 25, 9446, 6168, 912, 1058, 4, 276, 2115, 190, 3, 1060, 2025, 125, 71, 85, 8, 3079, 2431, 3024, 4, 3, 24, 353, 9, 8600, 38573, 26163, 2189, 2, 30996, 3, 119, 1, 1455, 1345, 121, 3, 2335, 1, 3, 101, 43, 9, 419, 220, 4345, 163, 5, 1455, 1345, 121, 3447, 6, 3, 1921, 3397, 1, 56, 242, 26163, 2189, 2825, 3223, 59, 1764, 445, 4496, 32, 694, 1367, 8600, 5, 927, 2132, 2, 1934, 22, 8, 169, 234, 477, 447, 4, 100, 6, 437, 410, 38, 94, 47, 264, 17, 403, 56, 1642, 40, 397, 5, 127, 1558, 225, 22, 3555, 24, 2, 8610, 9, 1658, 770, 182, 2, 445, 3799, 5, 131, 8600, 34, 1353, 992, 36, 5, 121, 15, 7022, 673, 2366, 4496, 1367, 1906, 6, 4001, 7, 5, 8, 1362, 1, 1558, 56607, 3, 36, 768, 6, 3, 69, 292, 1031, 2, 38, 906]",1160.0,17927283,Current management strategies intraocular retinoblastoma,21,0.10824742268041238
"Seneca Valley virus, a systemically deliverable oncolytic picornavirus, and the treatment of neuroendocrine cancers.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2007-10-30,"Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that oncolytic viruses can elicit antitumor responses when they are administered directly into localized cancers. However, the treatment of metastatic disease with oncolytic viruses has been challenging due to the inactivation of viruses by components of human blood and/or to inadequate tumor selectivity. We determined the cytolytic potential and selectivity of Seneca Valley Virus-001 (SVV-001), a newly discovered native picornavirus, in neuroendocrine and pediatric tumor cell lines and normal cells. Suitability of the virus for intravenous delivery in humans was assessed by blood inactivation assays. Safety was evaluated in vivo using an immune-competent mouse model, and efficacy was evaluated in vivo in athymic mice bearing tumors derived from human small-cell lung cancer and retinoblastoma cell lines.

"AR, the cell cycle, and prostate cancer.",Nuclear receptor signaling,Nucl Recept Signal,2008-02-01,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical effector of prostate cancer development and progression. The dependence of this tumor type on AR activity is exploited in treatment of disseminated prostate cancers, wherein ablation of AR function (achieved either through ligand depletion and/or the use of AR antagonists) is the first line of therapeutic intervention. These strategies are initially effective, and induce a mixed response of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. However, recurrent, incurable tumors ultimately arise as a result of inappropriately restored AR function. Based on these observations, it is imperative to define the mechanisms by which AR controls cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistic investigation has revealed that AR acts as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression, able to induce signals that promote G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, induce phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB), and thereby govern androgen-dependent proliferation. These functions appear to be independent of the recently identified TMPRSS2-ETS fusions. Once engaged, several components of the cell cycle machinery actively modulate AR activity throughout the cell cycle, thus indicating that crosstalk between the AR and cell cycle pathways likely modulate the mitogenic response to androgen. As will be discussed, discrete aberrations in this process can alter the proliferative response to androgen, and potentially subvert hormonal control of tumor progression.",Journal Article,4372.0,208.0,androgen receptor AR critical effector prostate development progression dependence type AR activity exploited treatment disseminated prostate ablation AR function achieved ligand depletion and/or use AR antagonists line therapeutic intervention strategies initially effective induce mixed response cycle arrest apoptosis prostate recurrent incurable ultimately arise inappropriately restored AR function Based observations imperative define mechanisms AR controls proliferation Mechanistic investigation revealed AR acts master regulator G1-S phase progression able induce signals promote G1 cyclin-dependent kinase CDK activity induce phosphorylation/inactivation retinoblastoma suppressor RB govern androgen-dependent proliferation functions appear independent recently identified TMPRSS2-ETS fusions engaged components cycle machinery actively modulate AR activity cycle indicating crosstalk AR cycle pathways likely modulate mitogenic response androgen discussed discrete aberrations process alter proliferative response androgen potentially subvert hormonal control progression,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 687, 153, 754, 16, 8, 740, 2070, 1, 12, 193, 2, 91, 3, 3721, 1, 26, 30, 267, 23, 754, 128, 16, 5177, 4, 24, 1, 3605, 163, 7893, 1650, 1, 754, 343, 513, 361, 298, 1232, 2286, 2, 15, 3, 119, 1, 754, 4444, 16, 3, 157, 328, 1, 189, 788, 46, 422, 32, 1625, 323, 2, 1290, 8, 1739, 51, 1, 31, 417, 1854, 15, 351, 4, 12, 37, 137, 387, 2641, 57, 2050, 3043, 22, 8, 757, 1, 13254, 4138, 754, 343, 90, 23, 46, 2172, 192, 16, 6305, 6, 1107, 3, 483, 20, 92, 754, 535, 12, 31, 457, 2716, 940, 71, 553, 17, 754, 4459, 22, 8, 7561, 2452, 1, 3344, 695, 124, 91, 1665, 6, 1290, 2312, 17, 1617, 3344, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 128, 1290, 982, 2297, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 2955, 2, 2267, 13779, 687, 470, 457, 46, 1681, 1322, 6, 40, 306, 1, 3, 761, 108, 5535, 4802, 2530, 1059, 9173, 392, 1628, 1, 3, 31, 417, 6415, 4489, 3319, 754, 128, 2432, 3, 31, 417, 631, 1716, 17, 8119, 59, 3, 754, 2, 31, 417, 460, 322, 3319, 3, 8233, 51, 6, 687, 22, 303, 40, 1588, 5447, 2152, 4, 26, 1129, 122, 2688, 3, 2441, 51, 6, 687, 2, 751, 28768, 1761, 182, 1, 30, 91]",1461.0,18301781,AR cycle prostate,5,0.02577319587628866
A phase I/II study of direct intraarterial (ophthalmic artery) chemotherapy with melphalan for intraocular retinoblastoma initial results.,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,2008-03-14,"To develop a technique that would allow us to cannulate repeatedly the ophthalmic artery of young children with advanced retinoblastoma, to find a dose of melphalan that would be tolerable and tumoricidal for retinoblastoma when given intraarterially, and to study the local ocular and systemic side effects of intraarterial melphalan in these children. Phase I/II clinical trial. Ten children with advanced retinoblastoma (Reese-Ellsworth V) eyes who were indicated for enucleation were entered into an institutional review board-approved protocol of ophthalmic artery infusion of melphalan to avoid enucleation. Cannulation of the ophthalmic artery was performed by a femoral artery approach using microcatheters while the children were under anesthesia and anticoagulated. Chemotherapy (melphalan) was infused into the artery over a 30-minute period. Ophthalmic examinations, retinal photography, and electroretinograms were used to document local toxicity, whereas physical examinations and complete blood counts were used to measure systemic toxicity. The ophthalmic arteries were successfully cannulated in 9 cases (total, 27 times), as many as 6 times in 1 patient. Dramatic regression of tumors, vitreous seeds, and subretinal seeds were seen in each case. No severe systemic side effects (sepsis, anemia, neutropenia, fever, or death) occurred. No transfusions were required (red cells or platelets). Three patients developed conjunctival and lid edema that resolved without treatment. There was no toxicity to the cornea, anterior segment, pupil, or motility. One (previously irradiated) eye developed retinal ischemia; another eye had no toxicity after intraarterial chemotherapy but did develop a radiationlike retinopathy after brachytherapy. Vision stabilized or improved in all but 1 patient after treatment. Electroretinograms were generally poor (advanced eyes were treated), but in 2 cases, the electroretinogram improved after treatment (and resolution of a retinal detachment). Seven eyes avoided enucleation. Two intraarterially treated eyes were enucleated, with no viable tumors identified pathologically. We developed a technique of direct ophthalmic artery infusion of melphalan for children with retinoblastoma. The technique had minimal systemic side effects (one patient had grade 3 neutropenia) and minimal local toxicity. Among the first 9 cases treated with this technique, 7 eyes destined to be enucleated were salvaged.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4330.0,289.0,develop technique allow cannulate repeatedly ophthalmic artery young children advanced retinoblastoma dose melphalan tolerable tumoricidal retinoblastoma given intraarterially local ocular systemic effects intraarterial melphalan children Phase I/II clinical trial children advanced retinoblastoma Reese-Ellsworth V eyes indicated enucleation entered institutional review board-approved protocol ophthalmic artery infusion melphalan avoid enucleation Cannulation ophthalmic artery performed femoral artery approach microcatheters children anesthesia anticoagulated Chemotherapy melphalan infused artery 30-minute period Ophthalmic examinations retinal photography electroretinograms document local toxicity physical examinations complete blood counts measure systemic toxicity ophthalmic arteries successfully cannulated 9 cases total 27 times 6 times 1 patient Dramatic regression vitreous seeds subretinal seeds seen case severe systemic effects sepsis anemia neutropenia fever death occurred transfusions required red platelets patients developed conjunctival lid edema resolved treatment toxicity cornea anterior segment pupil motility previously irradiated eye developed retinal ischemia eye toxicity intraarterial chemotherapy develop radiationlike retinopathy brachytherapy Vision stabilized improved 1 patient treatment Electroretinograms generally poor advanced eyes treated 2 cases electroretinogram improved treatment resolution retinal detachment Seven eyes avoided enucleation intraarterially treated eyes enucleated viable identified pathologically developed technique direct ophthalmic artery infusion melphalan children retinoblastoma technique minimal systemic effects patient grade 3 neutropenia minimal local toxicity 9 cases treated technique 7 eyes destined enucleated salvaged,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 690, 8, 1312, 17, 688, 1700, 843, 6, 45061, 11132, 3, 8267, 2872, 1, 1169, 541, 5, 131, 6, 2469, 8, 61, 1, 2370, 17, 688, 40, 2668, 2, 10814, 9, 198, 447, 45062, 2, 6, 45, 3, 293, 4345, 2, 403, 1152, 176, 1, 17320, 2370, 4, 46, 541, 124, 70, 215, 38, 160, 1618, 541, 5, 131, 16634, 16211, 603, 3799, 54, 11, 1103, 9, 7022, 11, 2836, 237, 35, 1115, 206, 2620, 850, 1182, 1, 8267, 2872, 904, 1, 2370, 6, 3085, 7022, 26450, 1, 3, 8267, 2872, 10, 173, 20, 8, 7649, 2872, 353, 75, 38087, 369, 3, 541, 11, 669, 6433, 2, 26039, 56, 2370, 10, 4524, 237, 3, 2872, 252, 8, 201, 3949, 727, 8267, 4209, 6831, 25071, 2, 31247, 11, 95, 6, 4753, 293, 155, 547, 900, 4209, 2, 236, 315, 1911, 11, 95, 6, 1463, 403, 155, 3, 8267, 10166, 11, 1878, 27948, 4, 83, 140, 181, 428, 1072, 22, 445, 22, 49, 1072, 4, 14, 69, 3079, 320, 1, 57, 14233, 7659, 2, 19150, 7659, 11, 527, 4, 296, 473, 77, 905, 403, 1152, 176, 4227, 1545, 778, 2775, 15, 273, 489, 77, 4987, 11, 616, 3422, 37, 15, 4407, 169, 7, 276, 12657, 2, 38672, 3306, 17, 3862, 187, 24, 125, 10, 77, 155, 6, 3, 33266, 2882, 4610, 56933, 15, 3603, 104, 373, 2398, 4922, 276, 6831, 5675, 1809, 4922, 42, 77, 155, 50, 17320, 56, 84, 205, 690, 8, 56934, 12124, 50, 1536, 5859, 7368, 15, 231, 4, 62, 84, 14, 69, 50, 24, 31247, 11, 1228, 334, 131, 3799, 11, 73, 84, 4, 18, 140, 3, 20602, 231, 50, 24, 2, 2125, 1, 8, 6831, 13252, 648, 3799, 5617, 7022, 100, 45062, 73, 3799, 11, 12719, 5, 77, 2663, 57, 108, 2998, 21, 276, 8, 1312, 1, 1196, 8267, 2872, 904, 1, 2370, 9, 541, 5, 3, 1312, 42, 1048, 403, 1152, 176, 104, 69, 42, 88, 27, 778, 2, 1048, 293, 155, 107, 3, 157, 83, 140, 73, 5, 26, 1312, 67, 3799, 19539, 6, 40, 12719, 11, 9459]",2333.0,18342944,phase I/II direct intraarterial ophthalmic artery chemotherapy melphalan intraocular retinoblastoma initial,7,0.03608247422680412
Increased cyclin D3 expression significantly correlates with p27 nuclear positivity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2008-08-12,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, are characterized by strong expression of c-Kit protein. Recently, it has been shown that gastrointestinal stromal tumors may also contain alterations of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle. In this study, we evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of cyclin D1 and D3, Ki-67, p27, and retinoblastoma protein expression in a group of 50 human gastrointestinal stromal tumors selected from the files of the Moffitt Cancer Center. Tissue sections from each case were subjected to immunostaining using the avidin-biotin complex method. Cyclin D1 nuclear positivity was detected in 21 of 50 (42%) and cyclin D3 in 24 of 50 (48%) cases. p27 high immunoreactivity and negative or decreased retinoblastoma protein expression were identified in 33 of 50 (66%) gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In 19 of 50 (38%) tumors, Ki-67 had high labeling index. Direct correlation was observed between cyclin D3 and p27 expression (P < .0001), and between cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma protein (P = .03). Coexpression of cyclin D3 and p27 was demonstrated by immunofluorescence. The p27 protein expression inversely correlated with tumor size (P = .004), but was not correlated with tumor grade (P = .12). Ki-67 directly correlated with both tumor size (P = .03) and tumor grade (P = .008). We report a direct correlation between cyclin D3 and p27 expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

"Retinoblastoma: one world, one vision.",Pediatrics,Pediatrics,2008-09-01,"Retinoblastoma is curable when diagnosed early and treated appropriately; however, the prognosis is dismal when the basic elements of diagnosis and treatment are lacking. In developing countries, poor education, lower socioeconomic conditions, and inefficient health care systems result in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal care. Furthermore, the complexity of multidisciplinary care required is seldom possible. Whereas ocular salvage is a priority in the Western world, death from retinoblastoma is still a major problem in developing countries. To bring the 2 ends of this spectrum together and provide a forum for discussion, the ""One World, One Vision"" symposium was organized, at which clinicians and researchers from various cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds converged to discuss their experiences. Strategies for early diagnosis in developing countries were discussed. Elements of the development of retinoblastoma centers in developing countries were discussed, and examples of successful programs were highlighted. An important component in this process is twinning between centers in developing countries and mentor institutions in high-income countries. Global initiatives by nongovernmental organizations such as the International Network for Cancer Treatment and Research, Orbis International, and the International Agency for Prevention of Blindness were presented.

T antigen mutations are a human tumor-specific signature for Merkel cell polyomavirus.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2008-09-23,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is a virus discovered in our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh that is monoclonally integrated into the genome of approximately 80% of human Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs). Transcript mapping was performed to show that MCV expresses transcripts in MCCs similar to large T (LT), small T (ST), and 17kT transcripts of SV40. Nine MCC tumor-derived LT genomic sequences have been examined, and all were found to harbor mutations prematurely truncating the MCV LT helicase. In contrast, four presumed episomal viruses from nontumor sources did not possess this T antigen signature mutation. Using coimmunoprecipitation and origin replication assays, we show that tumor-derived virus mutations do not affect retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) binding by LT but do eliminate viral DNA replication capacity. Identification of an MCC cell line (MKL-1) having monoclonal MCV integration and the signature LT mutation allowed us to functionally test both tumor-derived and wild type (WT) T antigens. Only WT LT expression activates replication of integrated MCV DNA in MKL-1 cells. Our findings suggest that MCV-positive MCC tumor cells undergo selection for LT mutations to prevent autoactivation of integrated virus replication that would be detrimental to cell survival. Because these mutations render the virus replication-incompetent, MCV is not a ""passenger virus"" that secondarily infects MCC tumors.",Journal Article,4137.0,456.0,Merkel polyomavirus MCV virus discovered laboratory University Pittsburgh monoclonally integrated genome approximately 80 human Merkel carcinomas MCCs Transcript mapping performed MCV expresses transcripts MCCs similar large LT small ST 17kT transcripts SV40 MCC tumor-derived LT genomic sequences examined harbor prematurely truncating MCV LT helicase contrast presumed episomal viruses nontumor sources possess antigen signature coimmunoprecipitation origin replication tumor-derived virus affect retinoblastoma suppressor Rb binding LT eliminate viral DNA replication capacity Identification MCC line MKL-1 monoclonal MCV integration signature LT allowed functionally test tumor-derived wild type WT antigens WT LT expression activates replication integrated MCV DNA MKL-1 findings suggest MCV-positive MCC undergo selection LT prevent autoactivation integrated virus replication detrimental survival render virus replication-incompetent MCV `` passenger virus '' secondarily infects MCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5855, 31, 13363, 13415, 16, 8, 1450, 2747, 4, 114, 1624, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 12030, 17, 16, 57387, 2102, 237, 3, 898, 1, 705, 493, 1, 171, 5855, 31, 826, 20623, 3268, 2568, 10, 173, 6, 514, 17, 13415, 8293, 2680, 4, 20623, 288, 6, 375, 102, 4980, 302, 102, 3062, 2, 57388, 2680, 1, 9734, 762, 4384, 30, 526, 4980, 572, 2866, 47, 85, 409, 2, 62, 11, 204, 6, 2760, 138, 9771, 7994, 3, 13415, 4980, 13072, 4, 748, 294, 5472, 26345, 4405, 29, 9618, 3375, 205, 44, 5766, 26, 102, 448, 1651, 258, 75, 15888, 2, 1938, 2079, 1013, 21, 514, 17, 30, 526, 1450, 138, 1022, 44, 1158, 30, 1245, 178, 2955, 791, 20, 4980, 84, 1022, 4964, 1667, 261, 2079, 2162, 911, 1, 35, 4384, 31, 328, 45266, 14, 1041, 848, 13415, 2676, 2, 3, 1651, 4980, 258, 2313, 843, 6, 3772, 412, 110, 30, 526, 2, 955, 267, 1820, 102, 1575, 158, 1820, 4980, 55, 3932, 2079, 1, 2102, 13415, 261, 4, 45266, 14, 37, 114, 272, 309, 17, 13415, 109, 4384, 30, 37, 1251, 881, 9, 4980, 138, 6, 1682, 57389, 1, 2102, 1450, 2079, 17, 688, 40, 6227, 6, 31, 25, 408, 46, 138, 7873, 3, 1450, 2079, 16841, 13415, 16, 44, 8, 16917, 1450, 522, 17, 12974, 17265, 4384, 57]",1404.0,18812503,antigen human tumor-specific signature Merkel polyomavirus,0,0.0

Persistence of retinal function after selective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion for retinoblastoma.,Documenta ophthalmologica. Advances in ophthalmology,Doc Ophthalmol,2009-01-25,"To assess potential retinal viability by electroretinography following selective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion for retinoblastoma. Uncontrolled prospective case series. Patients with advanced retinoblastoma were offered elective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion treatment under an IRB-approved protocol as an alternative to enucleation. The ophthalmic artery was cannulated under fluoroscopic control, and chemotherapeutic agents (melphalan and occasionally carboplatin) were directly infused at doses resulting in very high local tissue concentrations, but low systemic drug levels. Eyes were examined under anesthesia at 1-month intervals, and re-treated as indicated, up to a maximum of six infusions. Electroretinograms were obtained during examination under anesthesia, using ERG-jet contact lens electrodes and a hand-held mini-ganzfeld stimulator. The ERG protocol was similar to ISCEV standards except for briefer adaptation times as necessary to reduce the total anesthesia duration. We report initial results in the first ten patients attempted. Nine eyes were successfully cannulated and perfused. ERG data for these nine patients are reported. [Clinical results have been published elsewhere.] Follow up ranged from 3 to 14 months. Extensive, often total, retinal detachments were present in many of the treated eyes. While regression of tumor mass and vitreous seeds was observed in nearly all the patients, retinal detachment occasionally persisted. ERG responses were extinguished in these eyes. Eyes with largely attached retinas, notwithstanding the presence of large tumors at baseline, remained free of detachment after treatment. Normal or near-normal ERGs in these eyes were repeatedly obtained. Recovery of ERG amplitudes was observed in three patients following treatment. Retinal function can persist and even recover following selective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion for retinoblastoma.

Regulation of prostate cancer progression by galectin-3.,The American journal of pathology,Am. J. Pathol.,2009-03-12,"Galectin-3, a beta-galactoside-binding protein, has been implicated in a variety of biological functions including cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. The present study was undertaken to understand the role of galectin-3 in the progression of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis of galectin-3 expression revealed that galectin-3 was cleaved during the progression of prostate cancer. Galectin-3 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with reduced cell migration, invasion, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation, and tumor growth in the prostates of nude mice. Galectin-3 knockdown in human prostate cancer PC3 cells led to cell-cycle arrest at G(1) phase, up-regulation of nuclear p21, and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb), with no effect on cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2 and CDK4), and p27 protein expression levels.

Retrospective cohort study comparing patients with familial retinoblastoma from five centers in DC (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, Jordan, and Venezuela) versus a reference center in the USA. Ninety-two (32 from the USA and 60 from DC) patients were included. Forty-one (44.6%) patients avoided enucleation, 42 (45.7%) had 1 eye removed, and 9 (9.8%) underwent bilateral enucleation. Eleven (11.9%) had major pathology risk factors at enucleation. There were no cases of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Detection via screening was significantly less common in DC than in the USA (23.3% vs. 71.8%, P < 0.0001). Patients in DC were diagnosed at a significantly later age and with more advanced intraocular disease that led to increased risk of bilateral enucleation. Patients detected by screening in DC were significantly younger at diagnosis, had less advanced intraocular disease, better ocular preservation rates and survival results than those whose retinoblastoma was not detected via early screening. Five-year pEFS was 0.92 for the patients treated in the USA and 0.81 for the patients in DC (P = 0.42).

Trilateral retinoblastoma: potentially curable with intensive chemotherapy.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-03-01,"Trilateral retinoblastoma has been lethal in virtually all cases previously reported. We describe a series of 13 patients treated with intensive chemotherapy, defined as the intention to include high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Induction chemotherapy generally included vincristine, cisplatin or carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Hematopoietic stem cells typically were harvested after the first or second cycle of induction chemotherapy, usually from peripheral blood. High-dose chemotherapy regimens were thiotepa-based (n = 7) or melphalan and cyclophosphamide (n = 3). Trilateral sites were pineal (n = 11) and suprasellar (n = 2); 7 patients had localized (M-0) disease and six had leptomeningeal dissemination (M-1+). Five patients had trilateral retinoblastoma at original diagnosis of intra-ocular retinoblastoma; eight later developed trilateral disease at a median of 35 months (range 3-60 months) following diagnosis of intra-ocular retinoblastoma. One patient died of toxicity (septicemia and multi-organ system failure) during induction and three developed disease progression prior to high-dose chemotherapy. Nine patients received high-dose chemotherapy at a median of 5 months (range 4-9) post-diagnosis of trilateral disease. Five patients survive event-free at a median of 77 months (range 36-104 months) and never received external beam radiation therapy.

CRX is a diagnostic marker of retinal and pineal lineage tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2009-11-20,"CRX is a homeobox transcription factor whose expression and function is critical to maintain retinal and pineal lineage cells and their progenitors. To determine the biologic and diagnostic potential of CRX in human tumors of the retina and pineal, we examined its expression in multiple settings. Using situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we show that Crx RNA and protein expression are exquisitely lineage restricted to retinal and pineal cells during normal mouse and human development. Gene expression profiling analysis of a wide range of human cancers and cancer cell lines also supports that CRX RNA is highly lineage restricted in cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis of 22 retinoblastomas and 13 pineal parenchymal tumors demonstrated strong expression of CRX in over 95% of these tumors. Importantly, CRX was not detected in the majority of tumors considered in the differential diagnosis of pineal region tumors (n = 78). The notable exception was medulloblastoma, 40% of which exhibited CRX expression in a heterogeneous pattern readily distinguished from that seen in retino-pineal tumors.

Thiotepa/topotecan/carboplatin with autologous stem cell rescue in recurrent/refractory/poor prognosis pediatric malignancies of the central nervous system.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-04-01,"Thiotepa and carboplatin are known to be active in central nervous system tumors. Topotecan potentiates the anti-cancer effects of alkylators and crosses the blood-brain barrier. We present ten patients with recurrent or progressive central nervous system malignancies treated on a myeloablative regimen using these drugs. Treatment included: Thiotepa 300 mg/m(2) on days -8, -7, and -6; topotecan 2 mg/m(2) on days -8, -7, -6, -5, and -4; and carboplatin approximately 500 mg/m(2) (Calvert formula-area under the curve = 7) on days -5, -4, and -3. Stem cell rescue was on day 0. Age at study entry ranged from 2.5 to 20 years old (median age 8.7 years). Five had medulloblastoma (MB), four had high grade glioma (HGG), and one had trilateral retinoblastoma/pineoblastoma (tRB/PB). Prior treatment for all patients included surgery and chemotherapy (1-7 regimens, median 2). Nine patients received radiotherapy; one patient did not receive radiotherapy pre-study. Three patients had residual disease at the time of transplant. There were two toxic deaths. Four patients are event-free survivors at a median of 6 years (range 2.8-7.6 years) after treatment including 2/5 MB patients, 1/4 HGG patients, and the tRB/PB patient.

Nuclear targeting of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 reveals essential roles of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 localization and cyclin E in vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition.,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2010-02-10,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)), inhibits proliferation of a variety of cell types including adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We have previously shown that 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) increases the stability of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1), decreases cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity, and promotes G(1) phase accumulation in human prostate cancer cells. These effects correlate with cytoplasmic relocalization of CDK2. In this study, we investigated the role of CDK2 cytoplasmic relocalization in the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). CDK2 was found to be necessary for prostate cancer cell proliferation. Although induced by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) was dispensable for 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated growth inhibition. Reduction in CDK2 activity by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was associated with decreased T160 phosphorylation, a residue whose phosphorylation in the nucleus is essential for CDK2 activity. Ectopic expression of cyclin E was sufficient to overcome 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated cytoplasmic mislocalization of CDK2 and all antiproliferative effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3), yet endogenous levels of cyclin E or binding to CDK2 were not affected by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Similarly, knockdown of the CDK2 substrate retinoblastoma, which causes cyclin E up-regulation, resulted in resistance to 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated growth inhibition. Human prostate cancer cells resistant to growth inhibition by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) but retaining fully functional vitamin D receptors were developed. These cells did not exhibit 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated cytoplasmic relocalization of CDK2. Targeting CDK2 to the nucleus of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-sensitive cancer cells blocked G(1) accumulation and growth inhibition by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). These data establish central roles for CDK2 nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and cyclin E in the mechanism of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated growth inhibition in prostate cancer cells.",Journal Article,3632.0,36.0,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin 3 1,25- OH 2 3 inhibits proliferation variety types including adenocarcinoma prostate previously shown 1,25- OH 2 3 increases stability cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 KIP1 decreases cyclin-dependent kinase 2 CDK2 activity promotes G 1 phase accumulation human prostate effects correlate cytoplasmic relocalization CDK2 investigated role CDK2 cytoplasmic relocalization antiproliferative effects 1,25- OH 2 3 CDK2 necessary prostate proliferation induced 1,25- OH 2 3 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 KIP1 dispensable 1,25- OH 2 3 -mediated growth inhibition Reduction CDK2 activity 1,25- OH 2 3 associated decreased T160 phosphorylation residue phosphorylation nucleus essential CDK2 activity Ectopic expression cyclin E sufficient overcome 1,25- OH 2 3 -mediated cytoplasmic mislocalization CDK2 antiproliferative effects 1,25- OH 2 3 endogenous levels cyclin E binding CDK2 affected 1,25- OH 2 3 Similarly knockdown CDK2 substrate retinoblastoma causes cyclin E up-regulation resulted resistance 1,25- OH 2 3 -mediated growth inhibition Human prostate resistant growth inhibition 1,25- OH 2 3 retaining fully functional vitamin receptors developed exhibit 1,25- OH 2 3 -mediated cytoplasmic relocalization CDK2 Targeting CDK2 nucleus 1,25- OH 2 3 -sensitive blocked G 1 accumulation growth inhibition 1,25- OH 2 3 establish central roles CDK2 nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking cyclin E mechanism 1,25- OH 2 3 -mediated growth inhibition prostate",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[14, 243, 11430, 427, 27, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 1576, 457, 1, 8, 1362, 1, 31, 630, 141, 449, 1, 3, 21, 47, 373, 443, 17, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 1106, 3, 2769, 1, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 2804, 5584, 2140, 1226, 470, 216, 18, 4547, 128, 2, 2148, 499, 14, 124, 1835, 4, 171, 12, 37, 46, 176, 1513, 5, 2828, 19626, 1, 4547, 4, 26, 45, 21, 565, 3, 200, 1, 4547, 2828, 19626, 4, 3, 3669, 176, 1, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 4547, 10, 204, 6, 40, 1493, 9, 12, 31, 457, 242, 277, 20, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 2804, 5584, 10, 15142, 9, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 517, 129, 297, 628, 4, 4547, 128, 20, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 10, 41, 5, 340, 58653, 982, 8, 7840, 1310, 982, 4, 3, 4262, 16, 1452, 9, 4547, 128, 3647, 55, 1, 1226, 563, 10, 1952, 6, 1768, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 517, 2828, 16888, 1, 4547, 2, 62, 3669, 176, 1, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 1145, 2682, 148, 1, 1226, 563, 15, 791, 6, 4547, 11, 44, 1424, 20, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 1813, 1563, 1, 3, 4547, 4235, 92, 1626, 1226, 563, 126, 863, 627, 4, 251, 6, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 517, 129, 297, 171, 12, 37, 436, 6, 129, 297, 20, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 84, 14171, 1910, 583, 1610, 427, 1186, 11, 276, 46, 37, 205, 44, 2239, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 517, 2828, 19626, 1, 4547, 529, 4547, 6, 3, 4262, 1, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 745, 12, 37, 2582, 499, 14, 1835, 2, 129, 297, 20, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 46, 74, 1811, 854, 1790, 9, 4547, 928, 2828, 6105, 2, 1226, 563, 4, 3, 670, 1, 14, 243, 2912, 18, 427, 27, 517, 129, 297, 4, 12, 37]",1852.0,20147522,Nuclear targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 reveals essential roles cyclin-dependent kinase 2 localization cyclin E vitamin D-mediated growth inhibition,16,0.08247422680412371
Sulforaphane induces cell cycle arrest by protecting RB-E2F-1 complex in epithelial ovarian cancer cells.,Molecular cancer,Mol. Cancer,2010-03-02,"Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate phytochemical present predominantly in cruciferous vegetables such as brussels sprout and broccoli, is considered a promising chemo-preventive agent against cancer. In-vitro exposure to SFN appears to result in the induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in a variety of tumor types. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the inhibition of cell cycle progression by SFN are poorly understood in epithelial ovarian cancer cells (EOC). The aim of this study is to understand the signaling mechanisms through which SFN influences the cell growth and proliferation in EOC. SFN at concentrations of 5-20 microM induced a dose-dependent suppression of growth in cell lines MDAH 2774 and SkOV-3 with an IC50 of ~8 microM after a 3 day exposure. Combination treatment with chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, resulted in additive growth suppression. SFN at ~8 microM decreased growth by 40% and 20% on day 1 in MDAH 2774 and SkOV-3, respectively. Cells treated with cytotoxic concentrations of SFN have reduced cell migration and increased apoptotic cell death via an increase in Bak/Bcl-2 ratio and cleavage of procaspase-9 and poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP). Gene expression profile analysis of cell cycle regulated proteins demonstrated increased levels of tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB) and decreased levels of E2F-1 transcription factor. SFN treatment resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest through down modulation of RB phosphorylation and by protecting the RB-E2F-1 complex. SFN induces growth arrest and apoptosis in EOC cells. Inhibition of retinoblastoma (RB) phosphorylation and reduction in levels of free E2F-1 appear to play an important role in EOC growth arrest.",Journal Article,3612.0,43.0,Sulforaphane SFN isothiocyanate phytochemical present predominantly cruciferous vegetables brussels sprout broccoli considered promising chemo-preventive agent In-vitro exposure SFN appears induction apoptosis cell-cycle arrest variety types molecular mechanisms leading inhibition cycle progression SFN poorly understood epithelial ovarian EOC aim understand signaling mechanisms SFN influences growth proliferation EOC SFN concentrations 5-20 microM induced dose-dependent suppression growth lines MDAH 2774 SkOV-3 IC50 ~8 microM 3 day exposure Combination treatment chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel resulted additive growth suppression SFN ~8 microM decreased growth 40 20 day 1 MDAH 2774 SkOV-3 respectively treated cytotoxic concentrations SFN reduced migration increased apoptotic death increase Bak/Bcl-2 ratio cleavage procaspase-9 poly ADP-ribose -polymerase PARP expression profile cycle regulated demonstrated increased levels suppressor retinoblastoma RB decreased levels E2F-1 transcription factor SFN treatment resulted G1 cycle arrest modulation RB phosphorylation protecting RB-E2F-1 complex SFN induces growth arrest apoptosis EOC Inhibition retinoblastoma RB phosphorylation reduction levels free E2F-1 appear play important role EOC growth arrest,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9510, 10481, 35, 13790, 21293, 364, 2117, 4, 12327, 6024, 225, 22, 39256, 28992, 2, 12003, 16, 515, 8, 721, 3341, 3494, 420, 480, 12, 4, 439, 645, 6, 10481, 1233, 6, 757, 4, 3, 504, 1, 351, 2, 31, 417, 1854, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 30, 630, 137, 3, 219, 483, 1049, 6, 3, 297, 1, 31, 417, 91, 20, 10481, 32, 1240, 1784, 4, 701, 12, 37, 2249, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 1640, 3, 314, 483, 298, 92, 10481, 3859, 3, 31, 129, 2, 457, 4, 2249, 10481, 28, 1003, 1, 33, 179, 3550, 277, 8, 61, 470, 1332, 1, 129, 4, 31, 285, 37416, 18783, 2, 12393, 27, 5, 35, 5211, 1, 66, 3550, 50, 8, 27, 218, 645, 150, 24, 5, 1573, 420, 490, 627, 4, 3396, 129, 1332, 10481, 28, 66, 3550, 340, 129, 20, 327, 2, 179, 23, 218, 14, 4, 37416, 18783, 2, 12393, 27, 106, 37, 73, 5, 759, 1003, 1, 10481, 47, 405, 31, 1381, 2, 101, 1631, 31, 273, 847, 35, 344, 4, 5599, 1044, 18, 197, 2, 3155, 1, 10153, 83, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2041, 145, 55, 800, 65, 1, 31, 417, 1065, 652, 264, 101, 148, 1, 30, 1245, 178, 2955, 2, 340, 148, 1, 5391, 14, 866, 161, 10481, 24, 627, 4, 3344, 31, 417, 1854, 298, 1328, 2356, 1, 2955, 982, 2, 20, 11638, 3, 2955, 5391, 14, 840, 10481, 1516, 129, 1854, 2, 351, 4, 2249, 37, 297, 1, 2955, 982, 2, 628, 4, 148, 1, 115, 5391, 14, 1322, 6, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 2249, 129, 1854]",1664.0,20196847,Sulforaphane induces cycle arrest protecting RB-E2F-1 complex epithelial ovarian,3,0.015463917525773196
Superselective ophthalmic artery chemotherapy as primary treatment for retinoblastoma (chemosurgery).,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,2010-04-09,"To report on our 3-year experience with the use of superselective ophthalmic artery infusion of chemotherapy as initial, primary treatment for intraocular retinoblastoma. Prospective, institutional review board-approved clinical trial. Twenty-eight eyes of 23 newly diagnosed retinoblastoma patients (Reese-Ellsworth [RE] group V, 25 eyes; RE IV, 1 eye; RE III, 1 eye; RE II, 1 eye), ages 3-88 months (mean, 22; median, 11) followed for 3-37 months (mean, 15; median, 14). Cannulation of 1 or both ophthalmic arteries in young children with retinoblastoma was performed via the femoral artery under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis and chemotherapy (melphalan [n = 12], melphalan plus topotecan [n = 7], melphalan plus topotecan and carboplatin [n = 3], or melphalan plus carboplatin [n = 1]) infused. Patient survival, eye survival, systemic toxicity, complete blood counts, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and electroretinograms. We treated 23 newly diagnosed retinoblastoma patients initially with 75 separate intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions (range, 1-6 treatments; mean, 3.2) over a 3-year period. All children survived. Only 1 of the 28 eyes came to enucleation (for progressive disease). No eye was enucleated for ocular complications of the procedure and the only adverse ophthalmic findings were occasional transient lid edema, forehead hyperemia, and loss of nasal lashes. Kaplan-Meier enucleation free was 100% at 12 months and 89% at 2 years (95% confidence interval, 43%-98%).

Pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictates response to CDK4/6 inhibition in GBM.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2010-06-07,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal primary brain tumor harboring myriad genetic and epigenetic alterations. The recent multidimensional analysis of the GBM genome has provided a more complete view of the landscape of such alterations and their linked pathways. This effort has demonstrated that certain pathways are universally altered, but that the specific genetic events altered within each pathway can vary for each particular patient's tumor. With this atlas of genetic and epigenetic events, it now becomes feasible to assess how the patterns of mutations in a pathway influence response to drugs that are targeting such pathways. This issue is particularly important for GBM because, in contrast to other tumor types, molecularly targeted therapies have failed to alter overall survival substantially. Here, we combined functional genetic screens and comprehensive genomic analyses to identify CDK6 as a GBM oncogene that is required for proliferation and viability in a subset of GBM cell lines and tumors. Using an available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, we sought to determine if the specific pattern of retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated the response to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. We showed that codeletion of CDKN2A and CDKN2C serves as a strong predictor of sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. Thus, genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify a subset of GBMs likely to respond to CDK4/6 inhibition. More generally, these observations demonstrate that the integration of genomic, functional and pharmacologic data can be exploited to inform the development of targeted therapy directed against specific cancer pathways.",Journal Article,3515.0,138.0,Glioblastoma multiforme GBM fatal primary brain harboring myriad genetic epigenetic alterations recent multidimensional GBM genome provided complete view landscape alterations linked pathways effort demonstrated certain pathways universally altered specific genetic events altered pathway vary particular patient 's atlas genetic epigenetic events feasible assess patterns pathway influence response drugs targeting pathways issue particularly important GBM contrast types molecularly targeted therapies failed alter overall survival substantially combined functional genetic screens comprehensive genomic identify CDK6 GBM oncogene required proliferation viability subset GBM lines available small molecule targeting cyclin-dependent kinases CDKs 4 6 sought determine specific pattern retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictated response CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy showed codeletion CDKN2A CDKN2C serves strong predictor sensitivity selective inhibitor CDK4/6 genome-informed drug sensitivity studies identify subset GBMs likely respond CDK4/6 inhibition generally observations demonstrate integration genomic functional pharmacologic exploited inform development targeted therapy directed specific pathways,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[996, 3238, 1136, 16, 8, 3034, 86, 342, 30, 2105, 8390, 336, 2, 1418, 593, 3, 435, 7002, 65, 1, 3, 1136, 898, 71, 1052, 8, 80, 236, 3811, 1, 3, 2801, 1, 225, 593, 2, 136, 1199, 460, 26, 2919, 71, 264, 17, 1840, 460, 32, 6813, 1495, 84, 17, 3, 112, 336, 281, 1495, 262, 296, 308, 122, 2825, 9, 296, 1454, 69, 292, 30, 5, 26, 2643, 1, 336, 2, 1418, 281, 192, 1134, 5366, 1313, 6, 423, 832, 3, 764, 1, 138, 4, 8, 308, 1054, 51, 6, 600, 17, 32, 529, 225, 460, 26, 2537, 16, 823, 305, 9, 1136, 408, 4, 748, 6, 127, 30, 630, 2372, 238, 235, 47, 1551, 6, 2688, 63, 25, 2109, 467, 21, 397, 583, 336, 7508, 2, 949, 572, 318, 6, 255, 9518, 22, 8, 1136, 1836, 17, 16, 616, 9, 457, 2, 2120, 4, 8, 697, 1, 1136, 31, 285, 2, 57, 75, 35, 390, 302, 1354, 529, 1226, 470, 1549, 9336, 39, 2, 49, 21, 990, 6, 223, 492, 3, 112, 1177, 1, 308, 2297, 10575, 3, 51, 6, 3254, 49, 230, 36, 21, 224, 17, 11622, 1, 3175, 2, 17381, 4711, 22, 8, 1082, 980, 1, 485, 6, 8, 1094, 230, 1, 3254, 49, 631, 898, 2767, 234, 485, 94, 255, 8, 697, 1, 5556, 322, 6, 1892, 6, 3254, 49, 297, 80, 1228, 46, 2172, 608, 17, 3, 2676, 1, 572, 583, 2, 2788, 74, 122, 40, 5177, 6, 2295, 3, 193, 1, 238, 36, 1166, 480, 112, 12, 460]",1665.0,20534551,Pattern retinoblastoma pathway inactivation dictates response CDK4/6 inhibition GBM,66,0.3402061855670103
Medical radiation exposure and risk of retinoblastoma resulting from new germline RB1 mutation.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2011-05-01,"Although ionizing radiation induces germline mutations in animals, human studies of radiation-exposed populations have not detected an effect. We conducted a case-control study of sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma, which results from a new germline RB1 mutation, to investigate gonadal radiation exposure of parents from medical sources before their child's conception. Parents of 206 cases from nine North American institutions and 269 controls participated; fathers of 184 cases and 223 friend and relative controls and mothers of 204 cases and 260 controls provided information in telephone interviews on their medical radiation exposure. Cases provided DNA for RB1 mutation testing. Of common procedures, lower gastrointestinal (GI) series conferred the highest estimated dose to testes and ovaries.

The neutrophil elastase inhibitor elafin triggers rb-mediated growth arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis in breast cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-09-07,"Elafin, an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, is expressed in human mammary epithelial cells but is transcriptionally downregulated in breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that elafin may exert a tumor-suppressive activity in the context of breast cancer. In this study, we show that the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway governs the antitumor properties of elafin. In breast cancer cells with functional Rb, the expression of elafin triggered Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest. Elafin also exhibited suppressive activity in breast cancer cell lines lacking Rb, but this was associated with an induction of caspase-3-dependent, p53-independent apoptotic cell death. Normal mammary epithelial cells were not affected by elafin. Collectively, these results argue that elafin mediates tumor-suppressive effects that are cytostatic or cytotoxic depending on the Rb status.

Therapy-induced senescence in cancer.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2010-09-21,"Cellular senescence is a response to nonlethal stress that results in persistent cytostasis with a distinct morphological and biochemical phenotype. The senescence phenotype, detected in tumors through the expression of mRNA and protein markers, can be generated in cancer cells lacking functional p53 and retinoblastoma protein. Current research suggests that therapy-induced senescence (TIS) represents a novel functional target that may improve cancer therapy. TIS can be induced in immortal and transformed cancer cells by selected anticancer compounds or radiation, and accumulating data indicate that TIS may produce reduced toxicity-related side effects and increased tumor-specific immune activity. This review examines the current status of TIS-regulated mechanisms, agents, and senescence biomarkers with the goal of encouraging further development of this approach to cancer therapy.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor controls androgen signaling and human prostate cancer progression.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2010-11-22,"Retinoblastoma (RB; encoded by RB1) is a tumor suppressor that is frequently disrupted in tumorigenesis and acts in multiple cell types to suppress cell cycle progression. The role of RB in tumor progression, however, is poorly defined. Here, we have identified a critical role for RB in protecting against tumor progression through regulation of targets distinct from cell cycle control. In analyses of human prostate cancer samples, RB loss was infrequently observed in primary disease and was predominantly associated with transition to the incurable, castration-resistant state. Further analyses revealed that loss of the RB1 locus may be a major mechanism of RB disruption and that loss of RB function was associated with poor clinical outcome. Modeling of RB dysfunction in vitro and in vivo revealed that RB controlled nuclear receptor networks critical for tumor progression and that it did so via E2F transcription factor 1-mediated regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression and output. Through this pathway, RB depletion induced unchecked AR activity that underpinned therapeutic bypass and tumor progression. In agreement with these findings, disruption of the RB/E2F/nuclear receptor axis was frequently observed in the transition to therapy resistance in human disease. Together, these data reveal what we believe to be a new paradigm for RB function in controlling prostate tumor progression and lethal tumor phenotypes.",Journal Article,3347.0,179.0,Retinoblastoma RB encoded RB1 suppressor frequently disrupted tumorigenesis acts multiple types suppress cycle progression role RB progression poorly defined identified critical role RB protecting progression regulation targets distinct cycle control human prostate RB loss infrequently observed primary disease predominantly associated transition incurable castration-resistant state revealed loss RB1 locus major mechanism RB disruption loss RB function associated poor clinical outcome Modeling RB dysfunction vitro vivo revealed RB controlled nuclear receptor networks critical progression E2F transcription factor 1-mediated regulation androgen receptor AR expression output pathway RB depletion induced unchecked AR activity underpinned therapeutic bypass progression agreement findings disruption RB/E2F/nuclear receptor axis frequently observed transition therapy resistance human disease reveal believe new paradigm RB function controlling prostate progression lethal phenotypes,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2955, 4587, 20, 4596, 16, 8, 30, 1245, 17, 16, 746, 5576, 4, 1565, 2, 4459, 4, 232, 31, 630, 6, 3134, 31, 417, 91, 3, 200, 1, 2955, 4, 30, 91, 137, 16, 1240, 395, 467, 21, 47, 108, 8, 740, 200, 9, 2955, 4, 11638, 480, 30, 91, 298, 863, 1, 637, 834, 29, 31, 417, 182, 4, 318, 1, 171, 12, 347, 2955, 407, 10, 6440, 164, 4, 86, 34, 2, 10, 2117, 41, 5, 1970, 6, 3, 2641, 1517, 436, 1309, 195, 318, 553, 17, 407, 1, 3, 4596, 2474, 68, 40, 8, 458, 670, 1, 2955, 3220, 2, 17, 407, 1, 2955, 343, 10, 41, 5, 334, 38, 228, 2057, 1, 2955, 1527, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 553, 17, 2955, 1149, 928, 153, 3991, 740, 9, 30, 91, 2, 17, 192, 205, 1743, 847, 5391, 866, 161, 14, 517, 863, 1, 687, 153, 754, 55, 2, 6911, 298, 26, 308, 2955, 2286, 277, 39306, 754, 128, 17, 25305, 189, 5481, 2, 30, 91, 4, 2024, 5, 46, 272, 3220, 1, 3, 2955, 5391, 928, 153, 2310, 10, 746, 164, 4, 3, 1970, 6, 36, 251, 4, 171, 34, 1162, 46, 74, 2396, 2067, 21, 4629, 6, 40, 8, 217, 2431, 9, 2955, 343, 4, 1893, 30, 91, 2, 2266, 30, 2618]",1385.0,21099110,retinoblastoma suppressor controls androgen signaling human prostate progression,0,0.0

A total of 95 eyes of 78 patients with unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma were treated. The intervention was selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery and injection of chemotherapy, usually melphalan with or without topotecan. Drug dosage was determined by age and angioanatomy. The main outcome measures were procedural success, event-free (enucleation or radiotherapy) ocular survival, and ocular and extraocular complications. Catheterization succeeded in 98.5% of procedures. There were 289 chemotherapy injections (median, 3 per eye). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of ocular event-free survival rates at 2 years were 70.0% (95% confidence interval, 57.9%-82.2%) for all eyes, 81.7% (95% confidence interval, 66.8%-96.6%) for eyes that received intra-arterial chemotherapy as primary treatment, and 58.4% (95% confidence interval, 39.5%-77.2%) for eyes that had previous treatment failure with intravenous chemotherapy and/or external beam radiation therapy.

Therapeutically activating RB: reestablishing cell cycle control in endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2011-04-28,"The majority of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers are treated with endocrine therapy. While this is effective, acquired resistance to therapies targeted against ER is a major clinical challenge. Here, model systems of ER-positive breast cancers with differential susceptibility to endocrine therapy were employed to define common nodes for new therapeutic interventions. These analyses revealed that cell cycle progression is effectively uncoupled from the activity and functional state of ER in these models. In this context, cyclin D1 expression and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) phosphorylation are maintained even with efficient ablation of ER with pure antagonists. These therapy-resistant models recapitulate a key feature of deregulated RB/E2F transcriptional control. Correspondingly, a gene expression signature of RB-dysfunction is associated with luminal B breast cancer, which exhibits a relatively poor response to endocrine therapy. These collective findings suggest that suppression of cyclin D-supported kinase activity and restoration of RB-mediated transcriptional repression could represent a viable therapeutic option in tumors that fail to respond to hormone-based therapies.

"Transforming growth factor-β adaptor, β2-spectrin, modulates cyclin dependent kinase 4 to reduce development of hepatocellular cancer.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Hepatology,2011-05-01,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is an important regulator of cell growth, and loss of TGF-β signaling is a hallmark of carcinogenesis. The Smad3/4 adaptor protein β2-spectrin (β2SP) is emerging as a potent regulator of tumorigenesis through its ability to modulate the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. However, to date the role of the TGF-β signaling pathway at specific stages of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in relation to the activation of other oncogenic pathways, remains poorly delineated. Here we identify a mechanism by which β2SP, a crucial Smad3 adaptor, modulates cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), cell cycle progression, and suppression of HCC. Increased expression of β2SP inhibits phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) and markedly reduces CDK4 expression to a far greater extent than other CDKs and cyclins. Furthermore, suppression of CDK4 by β2SP efficiently restores Rb hypophosphorylation and cell cycle arrest in G(1) . We further demonstrate that β2SP interacts with CDK4 and Smad3 in a competitive and TGF-β-dependent manner. In addition, haploinsufficiency of cdk4 in β2sp(+/-) mice results in a dramatic decline in HCC formation compared to that observed in β2sp(+/-) mice. β2SP deficiency leads to CDK4 activation and contributes to dysregulation of the cell cycle, cellular proliferation, oncogene overexpression, and the formation of HCCs. Our data highlight CDK4 as an attractive target for the pharmacologic inhibition of HCC and demonstrate the importance of β2sp(+/-) mice as a model of preclinical efficacy in the treatment of HCC.",Journal Article,3187.0,36.0,Transforming growth factor beta TGF-β important regulator growth loss TGF-β signaling hallmark carcinogenesis Smad3/4 adaptor β2-spectrin β2SP emerging potent regulator tumorigenesis ability modulate suppressor function TGF-β date role TGF-β signaling pathway specific stages development hepatocellular carcinoma HCC particularly relation activation oncogenic pathways remains poorly delineated identify mechanism β2SP crucial Smad3 adaptor modulates cyclin dependent kinase 4 CDK4 cycle progression suppression HCC Increased expression β2SP inhibits phosphorylation retinoblastoma product Rb markedly reduces CDK4 expression far greater extent CDKs cyclins Furthermore suppression CDK4 β2SP efficiently restores Rb hypophosphorylation cycle arrest G 1 demonstrate β2SP interacts CDK4 Smad3 competitive TGF-β-dependent manner addition haploinsufficiency cdk4 β2sp +/- mice dramatic decline HCC formation compared observed β2sp +/- mice β2SP deficiency leads CDK4 activation contributes dysregulation cycle cellular proliferation oncogene overexpression formation HCCs highlight CDK4 attractive target pharmacologic inhibition HCC demonstrate importance β2sp +/- mice model preclinical efficacy treatment HCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3621, 129, 161, 1090, 2387, 1458, 16, 35, 305, 2452, 1, 31, 129, 2, 407, 1, 2387, 1458, 314, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 1719, 3, 10675, 39, 10171, 178, 9314, 26905, 18029, 16, 1478, 22, 8, 1157, 2452, 1, 1565, 298, 211, 801, 6, 3319, 3, 30, 1245, 343, 1, 2387, 1458, 137, 6, 1244, 3, 200, 1, 3, 2387, 1458, 314, 308, 28, 112, 1153, 1, 3, 193, 1, 134, 663, 823, 4, 2191, 6, 3, 363, 1, 127, 1302, 460, 469, 1240, 5610, 467, 21, 255, 8, 670, 20, 92, 18029, 8, 2653, 10675, 10171, 5259, 1226, 470, 216, 39, 3254, 31, 417, 91, 2, 1332, 1, 663, 101, 55, 1, 18029, 1576, 982, 1, 3, 145, 2821, 2955, 2, 2195, 2389, 3254, 55, 6, 8, 3272, 378, 1039, 76, 127, 9336, 2, 10149, 798, 1332, 1, 3254, 20, 18029, 4143, 8489, 2955, 21052, 2, 31, 417, 1854, 4, 499, 14, 21, 195, 608, 17, 18029, 5528, 5, 3254, 2, 10675, 4, 8, 6487, 2, 2387, 1458, 470, 1708, 4, 352, 9292, 1, 3254, 4, 18029, 399, 99, 4, 8, 3079, 1858, 4, 663, 1264, 72, 6, 17, 164, 4, 18029, 399, 18029, 2299, 1940, 6, 3254, 363, 2, 2444, 6, 3935, 1, 3, 31, 417, 763, 457, 1836, 851, 2, 3, 1264, 1, 6400, 114, 74, 1817, 3254, 22, 35, 3059, 283, 9, 3, 2788, 297, 1, 663, 2, 608, 3, 1187, 1, 18029, 399, 22, 8, 202, 1, 693, 209, 4, 3, 24, 1, 663]",1559.0,21520178,Transforming growth factor-β adaptor β2-spectrin modulates cyclin dependent kinase 4 reduce development hepatocellular,0,0.0

A PLS tissue microarray (TMA) (n = 56 patient specimens) was constructed for immunohistochemical analysis of molecular markers, and p53 gene sequencing (exons 5-9) was conducted. The average patient age was 57 years, and the patients presented with primary disease (n = 102), recurrent disease (n = 16), and metastatic disease (n = 37). Lower extremity was the most common disease site (40%), and the average tumor size was 11 cm. Complete follow-up data were available for 83 patients, and their median follow-up was 22.6 months. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 53%; and recurrent disease, unresectability, and microscopic positive margins were identified as predictors of a poor prognosis.

Killing the second messenger: targeting loss of cell cycle control in endocrine-resistant breast cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2011-07-04,"The majority (∼70%) of breast cancers are steroid hormone receptor (SR) positive at the time of diagnosis. Endocrine therapies that target estrogen receptor α (ERα) action (tamoxifen, toremifene, fulvestrant) or estrogen synthesis (aromatase inhibitors: letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane; or ovarian suppression) are a clinical mainstay. However, up to 50% of SR+ breast cancers exhibit de novo or acquired resistance to these clinical interventions. Mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapies often include upregulation and/or activation of signal transduction pathways that input to cell cycle regulation. Cyclin D1, the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent protein kinases four and six (CDK4/6) serves as a convergence point for multiple signaling pathways. In a recent paper entitled 'Therapeutically Activating Retinoblastoma (RB): Reestablishing Cell Cycle Control in Endocrine Therapy-Resistant Breast Cancer', Thangavel et al. reported maintenance of cyclin D1 expression and RB phosphorylation in the face of ER ablation in multiple breast cancer cell line models of endocrine resistance. RB-dysfunction defined a unique gene signature that was associated with luminal B-type breast cancer and predictive of poor response to endocrine therapies. Notably, a new CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD-0332991) was capable of inducing growth arrest by a mechanism that was most consistent with cellular senescence.

Loss of the retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2) histone demethylase suppresses tumorigenesis in mice lacking Rb1 or Men1.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2011-07-25,"Aberrations in epigenetic processes, such as histone methylation, can cause cancer. Retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2; also called JARID1A or KDM5A) can demethylate tri- and dimethylated lysine 4 in histone H3, which are epigenetic marks for transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) tumor suppressor promotes H3K4 methylation. Previous studies suggested that inhibition of RBP2 contributed to tumor suppression by the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Here, we show that genetic ablation of Rbp2 decreases tumor formation and prolongs survival in Rb1(+/-) mice and Men1-defective mice. These studies link RBP2 histone demethylase activity to tumorigenesis and nominate RBP2 as a potential target for cancer therapy.",Journal Article,3102.0,88.0,Aberrations epigenetic processes histone methylation cause Retinoblastoma binding 2 RBP2 called JARID1A KDM5A demethylate tri- dimethylated lysine 4 histone H3 epigenetic marks transcriptionally active chromatin multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 MEN1 suppressor promotes H3K4 methylation Previous studies suggested inhibition RBP2 contributed suppression retinoblastoma pRB genetic ablation Rbp2 decreases formation prolongs survival Rb1 +/- mice Men1-defective mice studies link RBP2 histone demethylase activity tumorigenesis nominate RBP2 potential target therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2152, 4, 1418, 1849, 225, 22, 1508, 569, 122, 708, 12, 791, 178, 18, 27083, 120, 3472, 46682, 15, 29184, 122, 35045, 11181, 2, 60381, 6041, 39, 4, 1508, 3739, 92, 32, 1418, 8418, 9, 6851, 544, 2287, 547, 3, 232, 1293, 2298, 267, 14, 7923, 30, 1245, 2148, 16549, 569, 698, 94, 1148, 17, 297, 1, 27083, 3447, 6, 30, 1332, 20, 3, 178, 8734, 467, 21, 514, 17, 336, 1650, 1, 27083, 2140, 30, 1264, 2, 5613, 25, 4, 4596, 399, 2, 7923, 4552, 399, 46, 94, 3460, 27083, 1508, 11869, 128, 6, 1565, 2, 25361, 27083, 22, 8, 174, 283, 9, 12, 36]",718.0,21788502,Loss retinoblastoma binding 2 RBP2 histone demethylase suppresses tumorigenesis mice lacking Rb1 Men1,1,0.005154639175257732
Time to stratify? The retinoblastoma protein in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.,Nature reviews. Urology,Nat Rev Urol,2011-08-02,"It is generally held that the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor functions in multiple tissues to protect against tumor development. However, preclinical studies and analysis of tumor samples of early disease did not support an important role of RB loss in the origin of prostate cancer. By contrast, recent observations in the clinical setting and subsequent modeling of RB function indicate that the tumor suppressor has specialized roles in controlling androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer, and primarily functions to prevent progression to the castration-resistant stage of disease. Furthermore, preclinical models have now shown that loss of RB expression or functional activity decreases the effectiveness of hormone therapy, yet seems to increase sensitivity to a subset of chemotherapeutic agents. Here, the current state of knowledge regarding the implications of RB loss for prostate cancer progression will be reviewed, and potential opportunities for developing RB as a metric to predict therapeutic response will be considered.",Journal Article,3094.0,23.0,generally held retinoblastoma RB suppressor functions multiple tissues protect development preclinical studies early disease support important role RB loss origin prostate contrast recent observations clinical setting subsequent modeling RB function indicate suppressor specialized roles controlling androgen receptor expression prostate primarily functions prevent progression castration-resistant stage disease Furthermore preclinical models shown loss RB expression functional activity decreases effectiveness hormone therapy increase sensitivity subset chemotherapeutic agents current state knowledge implications RB loss prostate progression reviewed potential opportunities developing RB metric predict therapeutic response considered,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[192, 16, 1228, 4033, 17, 3, 2955, 30, 1245, 1681, 4, 232, 742, 6, 4869, 480, 30, 193, 137, 693, 94, 2, 65, 1, 30, 347, 1, 191, 34, 205, 44, 538, 35, 305, 200, 1, 2955, 407, 4, 3, 1938, 1, 12, 20, 748, 435, 2172, 4, 3, 38, 546, 2, 706, 2057, 1, 2955, 343, 1008, 17, 3, 30, 1245, 71, 4791, 1790, 4, 1893, 687, 153, 55, 4, 12, 2, 1561, 1681, 6, 1682, 91, 6, 3, 1517, 436, 82, 1, 34, 798, 693, 274, 47, 1134, 443, 17, 407, 1, 2955, 55, 15, 583, 128, 2140, 3, 1236, 1, 785, 36, 1145, 2744, 6, 344, 485, 6, 8, 697, 1, 1573, 183, 467, 3, 291, 1309, 1, 922, 666, 3, 1268, 1, 2955, 407, 9, 12, 91, 303, 40, 446, 2, 174, 2605, 9, 931, 2955, 22, 8, 6515, 6, 678, 189, 51, 303, 40, 515]",997.0,21811228,Time stratify retinoblastoma castrate-resistant prostate,15,0.07731958762886598
High-throughput genotyping in osteosarcoma identifies multiple mutations in phosphoinositide-3-kinase and other oncogenes.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-10-17,"The identification of new genes that are mutated in osteosarcomas is critical to developing a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and discovering new targets for therapeutic development. The authors identified somatic nonsynonymous coding mutations in oncogenes associated with human cancers and hotspot mutations from tumor suppressor genes that were either well described in the literature or observed multiple times in human cancer sequencing efforts. Then, 961 mutations in 89 genes were systematically characterized across 98 osteosarcoma tumor samples and cell lines. All identified mutations were replicated on an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 14 mutations were identified in at least 1 osteosarcoma tumor sample or cell line. Some of the genetic changes identified were in tumor suppressor genes previously identified as altered in osteosarcoma: p53 (arginine→histidine at codon 273 [R273H], R→cysteine at codon 723 [R273C], and tyrosine→C at codon 163 [Y163C]) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) (glutamic acid→* at codon 137 [E137*]). Notably, multiple mutations were identified in phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA) (H1047R, E→lysine at codon 545 [E545K], and H→proline at codon 701 [H701P]) that were not observed previously in osteosarcoma. In addition, mutations in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) (glycine→serine at codon 12 [G12S]); cubilin (CUBN) (isolucine→valine at codon 3189 [I3189V]; observed in 2 separate tumor samples); cadherin 1, type 1, epithelial (CDH1) (alanine→threonine at codon 617 [A617T]; observed in 2 separate tumor samples); catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88 kDa (CTNNB1) (asparagine→S at codon 287 [N287S]); and fibrous sheath CABYR binding protein (FSCB) (S→leucine at codon 775 [S775L]) were observed. In this largest mutational profiling of osteosarcoma to date, the authors identified for the first time several mutations involving the PI3K pathway, adding osteosarcoma to the growing list of malignancies with PI3K mutations.

Intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in eyes with vitreous and/or subretinal seeding: 2-year results.,The British journal of ophthalmology,Br J Ophthalmol,2011-11-03,"To review the effectiveness of intra-arterial chemotherapy for advanced intra-ocular retinoblastoma with vitreous and/or subretinal seeds in naive (untreated) and previously treated eyes. Retrospective study, approved by the institutional review board, of 76 eyes of 67 patients with retinoblastoma with subretinal and/or vitreous seeding treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between May 2006 and August 2010. Despite advanced intraocular disease with seeding, the majority (56/76) of eyes were saved; 20/76 eyes were enucleated. Among treatment-naive eyes, the 2-year probability of ocular salvage was 83% (95% CI 27% to 97%) for eyes with subretinal seeding only, 64% (95% CI 24% to 87%) for eyes with vitreous seeding only, and 80% (95% CI 40% to 95%) for eyes with both. Among eyes that received previous treatment and had progressed, the 2-year probability of ocular salvage was 50% (95% CI 15% to 78%) for eyes with only subretinal seeding, 76% (95% CI 48% to 91%) for eyes with vitreous seeding only, and 54% (95% CI 20% to 79%) for eyes with both. Nine of 29 naive eyes (31%) were cured with intra-arterial (super-selective ophthalmic artery infusion of chemotherapy) chemotherapy alone. Unlike radiation or systemic chemotherapy, intra-arterial chemotherapy can usually prevent the need for enucleation in naive eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with seeding-especially if the seeding is subretinal.

This open-label phase I study (NCT00141297) enrolled patients who received PD 0332991 orally in six dose-escalation cohorts in a standard 3 + 3 design. Forty-one patients were enrolled. DLTs were observed in five patients (12%) overall; at the 75, 125, and 150 mg once daily dose levels. The MTD and recommended phase II dose of PD 0332991 was 125 mg once daily. Neutropenia was the only dose-limiting effect. After cycle 1, grade 3 neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia occurred in five (12%), three (7%), and one (2%) patient(s), respectively. The most common non-hematologic adverse events included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for tumor response; 10 (27%) had stable disease for ≥4 cycles of whom six derived prolonged benefit (≥10 cycles).

Cancer Res.,2011-12-12,"Small-cell prostate carcinoma (SCPC) morphology predicts for a distinct clinical behavior, resistance to androgen ablation, and frequent but short responses to chemotherapy. We sought to develop model systems that reflect human SCPC and can improve our understanding of its biology. We developed a set of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas xenografts and examined their fidelity to their human tumors of origin. We compared the expression and genomic profiles of SCPC and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) xenografts to those of typical prostate adenocarcinoma xenografts. Results were validated immunohistochemically in a panel of 60 human tumors. The reported SCPC and LCNEC xenografts retain high fidelity to their human tumors of origin and are characterized by a marked upregulation of UBE2C and other mitotic genes in the absence of androgen receptor (AR), retinoblastoma (RB1), and cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression. We confirmed these findings in a panel of samples of CRPC patients. In addition, array comparative genomic hybridization of the xenografts showed that the SCPC/LCNEC tumors display more copy number variations than the adenocarcinoma counterparts. Amplification of the UBE2C locus and microdeletions of RB1 were present in a subset, but none displayed AR nor CCND1 deletions. The AR, RB1, and CCND1 promoters showed no CpG methylation in the SCPC xenografts. Modeling human prostate carcinoma with xenografts allows in-depth and detailed studies of its underlying biology.

Common structural and epigenetic changes in the genome of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2011-12-07,"Progression of primary prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations that are thought to promote survival at metastatic sites. In this study, we investigated gene copy number and CpG methylation status in CRPC to gain insight into specific pathophysiologic pathways that are active in this advanced form of prostate cancer. Our analysis defined and validated 495 genes exhibiting significant differences in CRPC in gene copy number, including gains in androgen receptor (AR) and losses of PTEN and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Significant copy number differences existed between tumors with or without AR gene amplification, including a common loss of AR repressors in AR-unamplified tumors. Simultaneous gene methylation and allelic deletion occurred frequently in RB1 and HSD17B2, the latter of which is involved in testosterone metabolism. Lastly, genomic DNA from most CRPC was hypermethylated compared with benign prostate tissue. Our findings establish a comprehensive methylation signature that couples epigenomic and structural analyses, thereby offering insights into the genomic alterations in CRPC that are associated with a circumvention of hormonal therapy.

A novel retinoblastoma therapy from genomic and epigenetic analyses.,Nature,Nature,2012-01-11,"Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer of the developing retina that is initiated by the biallelic loss of RB1. Tumours progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but that multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically deregulated. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated the role of RB1 in genome stability and considered non-genetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation.

Pocket proteins suppress head and neck cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2012-01-11,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is a common cancer in humans long known to be caused by tobacco and alcohol use, but now an increasing percentage of HNSCC is recognized to be caused by the same human papillomaviruses (HPV) that cause cervical and other anogenital cancers. HPV-positive HNSCCs differ remarkably from HPV-negative HNSCCs in their clinical response and molecular properties. From studies in mice, we know that E7 is the dominant HPV oncoprotein in head and neck cancer. E7 is best known for its ability to inactivate pRb, the product of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene. However, loss of pRb function does not fully account for potency of E7 in causing head and neck cancer. In this study, we characterized the cancer susceptibility of mice deficient in the expression of pRb and either of two related ""pocket"" proteins, p107 and p130, that are also inactivated by E7. pRb/p107-deficient mice developed head and neck cancer as frequently as do HPV-16 E7 transgenic mice. The head and neck epithelia of the pRb/p107-deficient mice also displayed the same acute phenotypes and biomarker readouts as observed in the epithelia of E7 transgenic mice. Mice deficient for pRb and p130 in their head and neck epithelia showed intermediate acute and tumor phenotypes. We conclude that pRb and p107 act together to efficiently suppress head and neck cancer and are, therefore, highly relevant targets of HPV-16 E7 in its contribution to HPV-positive HNSCC.",Journal Article,2932.0,15.0,Head neck squamous carcinomas HNSCC common humans long known caused tobacco alcohol use increasing percentage HNSCC recognized caused human papillomaviruses HPV cause cervical anogenital HPV-positive HNSCCs differ remarkably HPV-negative HNSCCs clinical response molecular properties studies mice know E7 dominant HPV oncoprotein head neck E7 best known ability inactivate pRb product retinoblastoma susceptibility loss pRb function fully account potency E7 causing head neck characterized susceptibility mice deficient expression pRb related `` pocket '' p107 p130 inactivated E7 pRb/p107-deficient mice developed head neck frequently HPV-16 E7 transgenic mice head neck epithelia pRb/p107-deficient mice displayed acute phenotypes biomarker readouts observed epithelia E7 transgenic mice Mice deficient pRb p130 head neck epithelia showed intermediate acute phenotypes conclude pRb p107 act efficiently suppress head neck highly relevant targets HPV-16 E7 contribution HPV-positive HNSCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[718, 2, 691, 31, 826, 1209, 16, 8, 186, 12, 4, 3218, 319, 440, 6, 40, 1546, 20, 2607, 2, 2197, 119, 84, 1134, 35, 602, 1150, 1, 1209, 16, 1904, 6, 40, 1546, 20, 3, 827, 171, 14731, 933, 17, 708, 2, 127, 13836, 163, 933, 109, 9691, 1505, 4856, 29, 933, 199, 9691, 4, 136, 38, 51, 2, 219, 1571, 29, 94, 4, 399, 21, 6572, 17, 4540, 16, 3, 2156, 933, 6159, 4, 718, 2, 12, 4540, 16, 824, 440, 9, 211, 801, 6, 13772, 8734, 3, 2821, 1, 3, 30, 1432, 145, 137, 407, 1, 8734, 343, 1097, 44, 1910, 1967, 9, 3593, 1, 4540, 4, 3440, 718, 2, 12, 4, 26, 45, 21, 765, 3, 12, 1432, 1, 399, 1971, 4, 3, 55, 1, 8734, 2, 361, 1, 100, 139, 6575, 522, 652, 16865, 2, 15206, 17, 32, 120, 5458, 20, 4540, 8734, 16865, 1971, 399, 276, 718, 2, 12, 22, 746, 22, 1022, 933, 245, 4540, 2862, 399, 3, 718, 2, 7743, 1, 3, 8734, 16865, 1971, 399, 120, 2507, 3, 827, 286, 2618, 2, 901, 19040, 22, 164, 4, 3, 7743, 1, 4540, 2862, 399, 399, 1971, 9, 8734, 2, 15206, 4, 136, 718, 2, 7743, 224, 919, 286, 2, 30, 2618, 21, 2060, 17, 8734, 2, 16865, 2559, 1162, 6, 4143, 3134, 718, 2, 12, 2, 32, 673, 561, 867, 637, 1, 933, 245, 4540, 4, 211, 2925, 6, 933, 109, 1209]",1409.0,22237625,Pocket suppress head neck,20,0.10309278350515463
Success of intra-arterial chemotherapy (chemosurgery) for retinoblastoma: effect of orbitovascular anatomy.,"Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",Arch. Ophthalmol.,2012-02-01,"To review results of orbital angiography performed during intra-arterial chemotherapy (chemosurgery) for treatment of retinoblastoma to assess the association of angiographic variability in orbitovascular anatomy with tumor response and outcomes. Medical records and 64 orbital angiograms were reviewed for 56 pediatric patients with retinoblastoma undergoing chemosurgery using a combination of melphalan hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, or carboplatin. The major orbital arteries and capillary blush patterns were graded, and tumor response and recurrence were compared using the log-rank and Fisher exact tests. Statistically significant variables for tumor response were lacrimal artery prominence (P = .001), previous treatment (P = .003), and lacrimal blush (P = .004). The only statistically significant variable for vitreous seed response was ciliary body blush (P = .03). Statistically significant variables influencing time to recurrence and time to enucleation were choroidal blush absence (P = .01) and lacrimal artery presence (P = .03), respectively. The success of intra-arterial chemotherapy is dependent on delivery of drug to the target tumor within the eye via the ophthalmic artery. Because of the small volume of drug used (0.50-1.25 mL per treatment) and the selectivity of catheterization, variables affecting orbital blood flow greatly influence drug delivery and the success of chemosurgery.",Journal Article,2911.0,16.0,review orbital angiography performed intra-arterial chemotherapy chemosurgery treatment retinoblastoma assess association angiographic variability orbitovascular anatomy response outcomes Medical records 64 orbital angiograms reviewed 56 pediatric patients retinoblastoma undergoing chemosurgery combination melphalan hydrochloride topotecan hydrochloride carboplatin major orbital arteries capillary blush patterns graded response recurrence compared log-rank Fisher exact tests Statistically significant variables response lacrimal artery prominence P .001 previous treatment P .003 lacrimal blush P .004 statistically significant variable vitreous seed response ciliary body blush P .03 Statistically significant variables influencing time recurrence time enucleation choroidal blush absence P .01 lacrimal artery presence P .03 respectively success intra-arterial chemotherapy dependent delivery drug target eye ophthalmic artery small volume drug 0.50-1.25 mL treatment selectivity catheterization variables affecting orbital blood flow greatly influence drug delivery success chemosurgery,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 206, 99, 1, 5549, 8078, 173, 190, 2392, 3127, 56, 12234, 9, 24, 1, 6, 423, 3, 248, 1, 24499, 1982, 4, 61116, 5081, 5, 30, 51, 2, 123, 484, 1064, 2, 660, 5549, 28032, 11, 446, 9, 664, 815, 7, 5, 479, 12234, 75, 8, 150, 1, 2370, 12268, 2129, 12268, 15, 927, 3, 458, 5549, 10166, 2, 8943, 21711, 764, 11, 3468, 2, 30, 51, 2, 146, 11, 72, 75, 3, 1066, 1026, 2, 3135, 2472, 895, 712, 93, 682, 9, 30, 51, 11, 14765, 2872, 18771, 19, 144, 698, 24, 19, 1421, 2, 14765, 21711, 19, 1520, 3, 158, 712, 93, 1347, 9, 14233, 5467, 51, 10, 39898, 642, 21711, 19, 680, 712, 93, 682, 4743, 98, 6, 146, 2, 98, 6, 7022, 11, 12089, 21711, 1127, 19, 355, 2, 14765, 2872, 463, 19, 680, 106, 3, 1825, 1, 2392, 3127, 56, 16, 470, 23, 989, 1, 234, 6, 3, 283, 30, 262, 3, 4922, 847, 3, 8267, 2872, 408, 1, 3, 302, 433, 1, 234, 95, 13, 212, 14, 243, 542, 379, 24, 2, 3, 6072, 1, 15173, 682, 2319, 5549, 315, 1412, 3510, 1054, 234, 989, 2, 3, 1825, 1, 12234]",1350.0,22332209,Success intra-arterial chemotherapy chemosurgery retinoblastoma effect orbitovascular anatomy,0,0.0
Carboplatin-associated ototoxicity in children with retinoblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-02-27,"Carboplatin-induced ototoxicity remains poorly defined but is of potential great consequence in children with retinoblastoma. We retrospectively assessed the incidence of ototoxicity and its risk factors in children with retinoblastoma who were treated with carboplatin. We reviewed the audiologic test results of 60 patients with retinoblastoma who received front-line treatment with systemic carboplatin and vincristine according to the St Jude RET-3 protocol (n = 23) or best clinical management (n = 37). Ototoxicity was evaluated by three different grading systems. Twelve patients (20%) developed ototoxicity at some time after treatment initiation; however, ototoxicity resolved in two patients, and thus,10 patients (17%) had sustained hearing loss as documented at their most recent audiologic evaluation. Nine of these 10 patients had grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity, and nine patients were less than 6 months of age at the start of chemotherapy. Age at the start of chemotherapy was the only risk factor identified as a significant predictor of sustained hearing loss. Younger age was associated with an increased incidence of hearing loss. The different ototoxicity grading systems showed good overall agreement in the identification of patients with ototoxicity. Agreement was greatest between the Brock and Children's Cancer Group systems. We found that young patients with retinoblastoma who were treated with systemic carboplatin had a higher incidence of ototoxicity than previously reported. Younger patients (< 6 months of age at the start of treatment) were more likely to have ototoxicity than were older patients.

Selective CDK4/6 inhibition with tumor responses by PD0332991 in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2012-03-01,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) carries an unfavorable prognosis and requires new treatment strategies. The associated t(11:14) translocation results in enhanced cyclin D1 expression and cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity to promote cell-cycle progression. A pharmacodynamic study of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 was conducted in 17 patients with relapsed disease, using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and 3-deoxy-3[(18)F]fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) to study tumor metabolism and proliferation, respectively, in concert with pre- and on-treatment lymph node biopsies to assess retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation and markers of proliferation and apoptosis. Substantial reductions in the summed FLT-PET maximal standard uptake value (SUV(max)), as well as in Rb phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression, occurred after 3 weeks in most patients, with significant correlations among these end points. Five patients achieved progression-free survival time of > 1 year (range, 14.9-30.1+ months), with 1 complete and 2 partial responses (18% objective response rate; 90% confidence interval, 5%-40%).

ERG monitoring of retinal function during systemic chemotherapy for retinoblastoma.,The British journal of ophthalmology,Br J Ophthalmol,2012-03-18,"We have previously introduced electroretinography (ERG) as a proxy for visual function to monitor for retinal toxicity due to intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in young children. In this paper, we report ERG results for patients with retinoblastoma receiving initial treatment with systemic chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were patients presenting with retinoblastoma at <3 months of age or <6.0 kg in weight, with large tumours not amenable to local laser treatment, cryotherapy or plaque brachytherapy. Patients received intravenous carboplatin 18.7 mg/kg every 3-5 weeks, contingent on recovery of blood counts, until they had grown sufficiently to receive intra-arterial chemotherapy. ERG was performed during examination under anaesthesia at monthly intervals, using contact lens electrodes and a hand-held ganzfeld stimulator. 30-Hertz flicker responses are reported. Four patients were treated for bilateral retinoblastoma. All eyes responded well to systemic chemotherapy. 30-Hertz flicker ERGs improved during treatment in all eyes, significantly in six of eight eyes, and at least in one eye of each patient. Effective systemic chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in children who are too small for intra-arterial chemotherapy is compatible with significant increases in ERG amplitudes, even in eyes presenting with extinguished ERGs.

Herein, we evaluate the efficacy of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for retinoblastoma associated with >50% retinal detachment. Retrospective review of 37 eyes of 34 retinoblastoma patients who had extensive (>50%) bullous non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and received ophthalmic artery chemosurgery either as primary treatment or as ""salvage"" treatment after failed multi-cycle intravenous chemotherapy and/or external beam radiation (mean follow-up, 21 months). Data on patient and ocular survival, complications of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery treatments, time course of retinal reattachment, and serial electroretinograms (ERG) were collected. A total of 134 ophthalmic artery chemosurgery injections were performed. All children survive. Five eyes (5/37; 14%) were enucleated for progression of disease. The Kaplan-Meier enucleation-free survival rate at 2 years was 87.9% (95% confidence interval, 76.5-99.3%).

Topotecan and vincristine combination is effective against advanced bilateral intraocular retinoblastoma and has manageable toxicity.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-04-19,"New, effective chemotherapeutic agents are needed for intraocular retinoblastoma. This institutional clinical trial sought to estimate the rate of response to 2 courses of vincristine and topotecan (VT) window therapy in patients with bilateral retinoblastoma and advanced disease (Reese-Ellsworth group IV or V) in at least 1 eye. The topotecan dose started at 3 mg/m(2) /day for 5 days and was adjusted to target a systemic exposure of 140 ± 20 ng/mL · hour. The vincristine dose was 0.05 mg/kg for patients <12 months of age and 1.5 mg/m(2) for those >12 months of age at diagnosis. From February 2005 to June 2010, 27 patients received VT window therapy. Median age at enrollment was 8.1 months (range, 0.7-22.1 months). Twenty-four patients (88.9%) responded to window therapy (95% confidence interval = 71.3%-96.9%). Hematologic toxicity comprised grade 4 neutropenia (n = 27), grade 3 anemia (n = 19), and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (n = 16). Thirteen patients had grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support was added after 10 patients had been treated, and it significantly reduced the duration of grade 4 neutropenia (median, 7 vs 24 days; P < .001). Pharmacokinetic studies showed rapid changes in topotecan clearance rates during the first year of life. The combination of topotecan and vincristine is effective for the treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma.

"Treatment outcomes in black and white children with cancer: results from the SEER database and St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 1992 through 2007.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-04-30,"Treatment outcome for black patients with cancer has been significantly worse than for their white counterparts. We determined whether recent improved treatment had narrowed the gap in outcome between black and white pediatric patients. In a parallel comparison, we analyzed survival by disease category between black and white patients with childhood cancer registered in one of the 17 cancer registries of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program or treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, which provides comprehensive treatment to all patients regardless of their ability to pay, from 1992 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2007. Analysis of the SEER data indicated that in both study periods, black patients had significantly poorer rates of survival than did white patients, with the exception of a few types of cancer. Despite significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients who were treated from 2001 to 2007, the racial difference in survival has actually widened for acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma.

The authors sought to provide the first report characterizing long-term outcomes among survivors of extra-ocular retinoblastoma. Retrospective analysis of long-term medical outcomes in 19 survivors of extra-ocular retinoblastoma treated between 1992 and 2009. Severity of outcomes was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. All patients received intensive multimodality therapy for their extra-ocular disease after management of their primary intra-ocular disease, including conventional chemotherapy (n = 19, 100%), radiotherapy (n = 15, 69%), and/or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (n = 17, 89%). The median follow-up was 7.8 years from diagnosis of extra-ocular retinoblastoma (range 2-17.8 years). The most common long-term non-visual outcomes were hearing loss (n = 15, 79%), short stature (n = 7, 37%), and secondary malignancies [SMN] (n = 6, 31%). Sixty-eight percent of survivors exhibited ≥2 non-visual long-term outcomes of any grade. Except short stature, which was not graded for severity, Grade 3-4 outcomes were limited to: ototoxicity (n = 8; n = 4 require hearing aids), SMNs (n = 6), and unequal limb length (n = 1). Five patients who developed SMNs carried a known RB1 mutation. SMNs developed at a median of 11.1 years after initial diagnosis; two patients died of their SMN. Long-term cardiac, pulmonary, hepatobiliary, or renal conditions were not identified in any survivors.

Historical trends in the use of radiation therapy for pediatric cancers: 1973-2008.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-12-27,"This study was undertaken to assess historical trends in the use of radiation therapy (RT) for pediatric cancers over the past 4 decades. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the 9 original tumor registries (SEER-9) was queried to identify patients aged 0 to 19 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, bone and joint cancer, cancer of the brain and nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, Wilms tumor, or retinoblastoma from 1973 to 2008. Patients were grouped into 4-year time epochs. The number and percentage of patients who received RT as part of their initial treatment were calculated per epoch by each diagnosis group from 1973 to 2008. RT use for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and retinoblastoma declined sharply from 57%, 57%, and 30% in 1973 to 1976 to 11%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, in 2005 to 2008. Similarly, smaller declines in RT use were also seen in brain cancer (70%-39%), bone cancer (41%-21%), Wilms tumor (75%-53%), and neuroblastoma (60%-25%). RT use curves for Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma were nonlinear with nadirs in 1993 to 1996 at 39% and 19%, respectively. There were minimal changes in RT use for Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia, roughly stable at 72%, 40%, and 11%, respectively. Almost all patients treated with RT were given external beam RT exclusively. However, from 1985 to 2008, treatments involving brachytherapy, radioisotopes, or combination therapy increased in frequency, comprising 1.8%, 4.6%, and 11.9% of RT treatments in brain cancer, soft tissue cancer, and retinoblastoma, respectively. The use of RT is declining over time in 7 of 10 pediatric cancer categories.

Epigenetic silencing of retinoblastoma gene regulates pathologic differentiation of myeloid cells in cancer.,Nature immunology,Nat. Immunol.,2013-01-27,"Two major populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) regulate immune responses in cancer and other pathologic conditions. Under physiologic conditions, Ly6C(hi)Ly6G(-) inflammatory monocytes, which are the normal counterpart of M-MDSCs, differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. PMN-MDSCs are the predominant group of MDSCs that accumulates in cancer. Here we show that a large proportion of M-MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice acquired phenotypic, morphological and functional features of PMN-MDSCs. Acquisition of this phenotype, but not the functional attributes of PMN-MDSCs, was mediated by transcriptional silencing of the retinoblastoma gene through epigenetic modifications mediated by histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC-2).

The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression.,Current drug targets,Curr Drug Targets,2013-04-01,"Androgen receptor activity is essential for prostate cancer development and progression. While there are classically defined roles for the retinoblastoma (Rb) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways in maintenance of cell cycle control and the DNA damage response, recent studies have demonstrated a direct role of these two pathways in regulating AR expression and function. While the role of Pten deregulation in prostate cancer has provided much insight in to the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression, emerging roles for Rb and p53 are likely to further expand upon our understanding of tumor suppressor/nuclear receptor interaction. As disconnecting mitogenic signaling from AR-mediated gene transcription underlies the progression to castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), functional inactivation of these two tumor suppressor pathways represents one mechanism through which AR protein levels can be upregulated and AR-mediated gene transcription can become aberrant. Importantly, recent advances in small molecule inhibitor design and discovery have led to the identification of agents capable of targeting these two prominent pathways and restoring the function of deregulated wild-type Rb and p53 protein. While such agents have undergone extensive study in many solid tumor types, the additional importance of Rb and p53 in restraining transcription of the AR gene within the prostate provides impetus for examining how loss of these two tumor suppressor proteins can facilitate transition of prostate cancers to CRPC. As will be reviewed in this article, restoration of Rb and p53 functions are not only important in regard to shortterm cell cycle regulation and response to genomic stresses, but likely have direct implications for deregulation of the AR locus.",Journal Article,2486.0,12.0,Androgen receptor activity essential prostate development progression classically defined roles retinoblastoma Rb p53 suppressor pathways maintenance cycle control DNA damage response recent studies demonstrated direct role pathways regulating AR expression function role Pten deregulation prostate provided insight mechanisms underlying prostate initiation progression emerging roles Rb p53 likely expand understanding suppressor/nuclear receptor interaction disconnecting mitogenic signaling AR-mediated transcription underlies progression castrate resistant prostate CRPC functional inactivation suppressor pathways represents mechanism AR levels upregulated AR-mediated transcription aberrant Importantly recent advances small molecule inhibitor design discovery led identification agents capable targeting prominent pathways restoring function deregulated wild-type Rb p53 agents undergone extensive solid types additional importance Rb p53 restraining transcription AR prostate provides impetus examining loss suppressor facilitate transition prostate CRPC reviewed article restoration Rb p53 functions important regard shortterm cycle regulation response genomic stresses likely direct implications deregulation AR locus,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[687, 153, 128, 16, 1452, 9, 12, 193, 2, 91, 369, 125, 32, 9260, 395, 1790, 9, 3, 2955, 2, 624, 30, 1245, 460, 4, 1146, 1, 31, 417, 182, 2, 3, 261, 1350, 51, 435, 94, 47, 264, 8, 1196, 200, 1, 46, 100, 460, 4, 2681, 754, 55, 2, 343, 369, 3, 200, 1, 820, 4765, 4, 12, 71, 1052, 1802, 2670, 4, 6, 3, 483, 1181, 12, 1118, 2, 91, 1478, 1790, 9, 2955, 2, 624, 32, 322, 6, 195, 4082, 1548, 114, 612, 1, 30, 1245, 928, 153, 915, 22, 62460, 8233, 314, 29, 754, 517, 145, 866, 10702, 3, 91, 6, 4435, 436, 12, 1752, 583, 2297, 1, 46, 100, 30, 1245, 460, 1449, 104, 670, 298, 92, 754, 178, 148, 122, 40, 2684, 2, 754, 517, 145, 866, 122, 1417, 1898, 1859, 435, 954, 4, 302, 1354, 230, 771, 2, 1574, 47, 836, 6, 3, 911, 1, 183, 2787, 1, 529, 46, 100, 3689, 460, 2, 8364, 3, 343, 1, 5415, 955, 267, 2955, 2, 624, 178, 369, 225, 183, 47, 1989, 1344, 45, 4, 445, 537, 30, 630, 3, 402, 1187, 1, 2955, 2, 624, 4, 27169, 866, 1, 3, 754, 145, 262, 3, 777, 11582, 9, 3282, 832, 407, 1, 46, 100, 30, 1245, 652, 122, 1876, 1970, 1, 163, 6, 1752, 22, 303, 40, 446, 4, 26, 946, 5194, 1, 2955, 2, 624, 1681, 32, 44, 158, 305, 4, 2539, 6, 62461, 31, 417, 863, 2, 51, 6, 572, 11804, 84, 322, 47, 1196, 1268, 9, 4765, 1, 3, 754, 2474]",1711.0,23410128,role suppressor dysregulation prostate progression,2,0.010309278350515464

"The anti-melanoma activity of dinaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, is dependent on p53 signaling.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-03-18,"Although cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)-2 is known to be dispensable for the growth of most tumors, it is thought to be important for the proliferation of melanoma cells, where its expression is controlled by the melanocyte-lineage specific transcription factor MITF. Treatment of a panel of melanoma cells with the CDK inhibitor dinaciclib led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of growth under both 2D adherent and 3D organotypic cell culture conditions. Dinaciclib targeted melanoma cell lines regardless of cdk2 or MITF levels. Inhibition of growth was associated with a rapid induction of G2/M cell arrest and apoptosis. Treatment of human melanoma mouse xenografts with dinaciclib led to tumor regression associated with reduced retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression. Further mechanistic studies revealed that dinaciclib induces p53 expression whilst simultaneously downregulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Mcl-1 and XIAP. To clarify the role of p53 activation in the dinaciclib-induced cell death, we generated melanoma cell lines in which p53 expression was knocked down using a shRNA lentiviral vector. Knockdown of p53 completely abolished the induction of apoptosis seen following dinaciclib treatment as shown by a lack of annexin-V staining and caspase-3 cleavage.

Phase II trial of the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 in patients with advanced CDK4-amplified well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-04-08,"CDK4 is amplified in > 90% of well-differentiated (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLS). The selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)/CDK6 inhibitor PD0332991 inhibits growth and induces senescence in cell lines and xenografts. In a phase I trial of PD0332991, several patients with WDLS or DDLS experienced prolonged stable disease. We performed an open-label phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of PD0332991 in patients with advanced WDLS/DDLS. Patients age ≥ 18 years experiencing disease progression while receiving systemic therapy before enrollment received PD0332991 200 mg orally once per day for 14 consecutive days in 21-day cycles. All were required to have CDK4 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and retinoblastoma protein (RB) expression by immunohistochemistry (≥ 1+). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks, with 12-week PFS of ≥ 40% considered promising and ≤ 20% not promising. If ≥ nine of 28 patients were progression free at 12 weeks, PD0332991 would be considered active. We screened 48 patients (44 of 48 had CDK4 amplification; 41 of 44 were RB positive). Of those, 30 were enrolled, and 29 were evaluable for the primary end point. Grade 3 to 4 events included anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (30%), neutropenia (50%), and febrile neutropenia (3%). At 12 weeks, PFS was 66% (90% CI, 51% to 100%), significantly exceeding the primary end point. The median PFS was 18 weeks. There was one partial response. Treatment with the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 was associated with a favorable progression-free rate in patients with CDK4-amplified and RB-expressing WDLS/DDLS who had progressive disease despite systemic therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2479.0,238.0,CDK4 amplified 90 well-differentiated WDLS dedifferentiated liposarcomas DDLS selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 CDK4 /CDK6 inhibitor PD0332991 inhibits growth induces senescence lines xenografts phase trial PD0332991 patients WDLS DDLS experienced prolonged stable disease performed open-label phase II determine safety efficacy PD0332991 patients advanced WDLS/DDLS Patients age ≥ 18 years experiencing disease progression receiving systemic therapy enrollment received PD0332991 200 mg orally day 14 consecutive days 21-day cycles required CDK4 amplification fluorescence situ hybridization retinoblastoma RB expression immunohistochemistry ≥ 1+ primary end point progression-free survival PFS 12 weeks 12-week PFS ≥ 40 considered promising ≤ 20 promising ≥ 28 patients progression free 12 weeks PD0332991 considered active screened 48 patients 44 48 CDK4 amplification 41 44 RB positive 30 enrolled 29 evaluable primary end point Grade 3 4 events included anemia 17 thrombocytopenia 30 neutropenia 50 febrile neutropenia 3 12 weeks PFS 66 90 CI 51 100 significantly exceeding primary end point median PFS 18 weeks partial response Treatment CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 associated favorable progression-free rate patients CDK4-amplified RB-expressing WDLS/DDLS progressive disease despite systemic therapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3254, 16, 2429, 4, 424, 1, 149, 1442, 10602, 2, 6275, 7880, 9320, 3, 1094, 1226, 470, 216, 39, 3254, 9518, 230, 18052, 1576, 129, 2, 1516, 4672, 4, 31, 285, 2, 1348, 4, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 18052, 392, 7, 5, 10602, 15, 9320, 592, 1069, 585, 34, 21, 173, 35, 1020, 1756, 124, 215, 45, 6, 223, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 18052, 4, 7, 5, 131, 10602, 9320, 7, 89, 749, 203, 60, 2985, 34, 91, 369, 357, 403, 36, 348, 1798, 103, 18052, 1250, 81, 1428, 1059, 379, 218, 9, 213, 935, 162, 4, 239, 218, 410, 62, 11, 616, 6, 47, 3254, 1073, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 2, 178, 2955, 55, 20, 888, 749, 14, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 91, 115, 25, 300, 28, 133, 244, 5, 133, 647, 300, 1, 749, 327, 515, 721, 2, 1552, 179, 44, 721, 492, 749, 762, 1, 339, 7, 11, 91, 115, 28, 133, 244, 18052, 688, 40, 515, 544, 21, 2261, 576, 7, 584, 1, 576, 42, 3254, 1073, 605, 1, 584, 11, 2955, 109, 1, 135, 201, 11, 346, 2, 462, 11, 859, 9, 3, 86, 396, 741, 88, 27, 6, 39, 281, 159, 1545, 269, 1340, 201, 778, 212, 2, 2498, 778, 27, 28, 133, 244, 300, 10, 700, 424, 58, 725, 6, 394, 97, 5178, 3, 86, 396, 741, 3, 52, 300, 10, 203, 244, 125, 10, 104, 450, 51, 24, 5, 3, 3254, 230, 18052, 10, 41, 5, 8, 913, 91, 115, 116, 4, 7, 5, 3254, 2429, 2, 2955, 1046, 10602, 9320, 54, 42, 1014, 34, 550, 403, 36]",1638.0,23569312,Phase II trial CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 patients advanced CDK4-amplified well-differentiated dedifferentiated liposarcoma,0,0.0
CRM1 and BRAF inhibition synergize and induce tumor regression in BRAF-mutant melanoma.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2013-04-24,"Resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy places priority on developing BRAF inhibitor-based combinations that will overcome de novo resistance and prevent the emergence of acquired mechanisms of resistance. The CRM1 receptor mediates the nuclear export of critical proteins required for melanoma proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. We hypothesize that by inhibiting CRM1-mediated nuclear export, we will alter the function of these proteins resulting in decreased melanoma viability and enhanced BRAF inhibitor antitumoral effects. To test our hypothesis, selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) analogs KPT-185, KPT-251, KPT-276, and KPT-330 were used to induce CRM1 inhibition. Analogs PLX-4720 and PLX-4032 were used as BRAF inhibitors. Compounds were tested in xenograft and in vitro melanoma models. In vitro, we found CRM1 inhibition decreases melanoma cell proliferation independent of BRAF mutation status and synergistically enhances the effects of BRAF inhibition on BRAF-mutant melanoma by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. In melanoma xenograft models, CRM1 inhibition reduces tumor growth independent of BRAF or NRAS status and induces complete regression of BRAF V600E tumors when combined with BRAF inhibition. Mechanistic studies show that CRM1 inhibition was associated with p53 stabilization and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and survivin modulation. Furthermore, we found that BRAF inhibition abrogates extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation associated with CRM1 inhibition, which may contribute to the synergy of the combination. In conclusion, CRM1 inhibition impairs melanoma survival in both BRAF-mutant and wild-type melanoma. The combination of CRM1 and BRAF inhibition synergizes and induces melanoma regression in BRAF-mutant melanoma.",Journal Article,2463.0,,Resistance BRAF inhibitor therapy places priority developing BRAF inhibitor-based combinations overcome novo resistance prevent emergence acquired mechanisms resistance CRM1 receptor mediates nuclear export critical required melanoma proliferation survival drug resistance hypothesize inhibiting CRM1-mediated nuclear export alter function resulting decreased melanoma viability enhanced BRAF inhibitor antitumoral effects test hypothesis selective inhibitors nuclear export SINE analogs KPT-185 KPT-251 KPT-276 KPT-330 induce CRM1 inhibition Analogs PLX-4720 PLX-4032 BRAF inhibitors Compounds tested xenograft vitro melanoma models vitro CRM1 inhibition decreases melanoma proliferation independent BRAF status synergistically enhances effects BRAF inhibition BRAF-mutant melanoma promoting cell-cycle arrest apoptosis melanoma xenograft models CRM1 inhibition reduces growth independent BRAF NRAS status induces complete regression BRAF V600E combined BRAF inhibition Mechanistic studies CRM1 inhibition associated p53 stabilization retinoblastoma pRb survivin modulation Furthermore BRAF inhibition abrogates extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation associated CRM1 inhibition contribute synergy combination CRM1 inhibition impairs melanoma survival BRAF-mutant wild-type melanoma combination CRM1 BRAF inhibition synergizes induces melanoma regression BRAF-mutant melanoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[251, 6, 566, 230, 36, 14100, 4690, 23, 931, 566, 230, 90, 1247, 17, 303, 1768, 1566, 2018, 251, 2, 1682, 3, 3397, 1, 1294, 483, 1, 251, 3, 15053, 153, 3961, 3, 928, 8202, 1, 740, 652, 616, 9, 457, 25, 2, 234, 251, 21, 4919, 17, 20, 2062, 15053, 517, 928, 8202, 21, 303, 2688, 3, 343, 1, 46, 652, 1113, 4, 340, 2120, 2, 651, 566, 230, 13808, 176, 6, 412, 114, 1492, 1094, 222, 1, 928, 8202, 17407, 4063, 15054, 5805, 15054, 7288, 15054, 7976, 2, 15054, 7105, 11, 95, 6, 1290, 15053, 297, 4063, 47716, 47717, 2, 47716, 35535, 11, 95, 22, 566, 222, 2411, 11, 650, 4, 1330, 2, 4, 439, 274, 4, 439, 21, 204, 15053, 297, 2140, 31, 457, 306, 1, 566, 258, 156, 2, 4240, 2519, 3, 176, 1, 566, 297, 23, 566, 620, 20, 2388, 31, 417, 1854, 2, 351, 4, 1330, 274, 15053, 297, 2389, 30, 129, 306, 1, 566, 15, 2845, 156, 2, 1516, 236, 320, 1, 566, 2047, 57, 198, 397, 5, 566, 297, 2716, 94, 514, 17, 15053, 297, 10, 41, 5, 624, 3184, 2, 178, 8734, 2, 3160, 2356, 798, 21, 204, 17, 566, 297, 8044, 1976, 1235, 1065, 216, 982, 41, 5, 15053, 297, 92, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 3439, 1, 3, 150, 4, 1221, 15053, 297, 8312, 25, 4, 110, 566, 620, 2, 955, 267, 3, 150, 1, 15053, 2, 566, 297, 10824, 2, 1516, 320, 4, 566, 620]",1664.0,23615632,CRM1 BRAF inhibition synergize induce regression BRAF-mutant melanoma,0,0.0

Salvage/adjuvant brachytherapy after ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for intraocular retinoblastoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2013-08-14,"To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of brachytherapy after ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) for retinoblastoma. This was a single-arm, retrospective study of 15 eyes in 15 patients treated with OAC followed by brachytherapy at (blinded institution) between May 1, 2006, and December 31, 2012, with a median 19 months' follow-up from plaque insertion. Outcome measurements included patient and ocular survival, visual function, and retinal toxicity measured by electroretinogram (ERG). Brachytherapy was used as adjuvant treatment in 2 eyes and as salvage therapy in 13 eyes of which 12 had localized vitreous seeding. No patients developed metastasis or died of retinoblastoma. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of ocular survival was 79.4% (95% confidence interval 48.7%-92.8%) at 18 months. Three eyes were enucleated, and an additional 6 eyes developed out-of-target volume recurrences, which were controlled with additional treatments.

Carboplatin +/- topotecan ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for intraocular retinoblastoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-08-21,"Carboplatin administered systemically or periocularly can result in dramatic and prompt regression of retinoblastoma. However, both routes are rarely curative alone and have undesirable side effects. We aimed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin +/- topotecan delivered by ophthalmic artery chemosurgery whereby chemotherapy is infused into the eye via the ophthalmic artery. This retrospective, IRB-approved study investigated retinoblastoma patients whom received carboplatin +/- topotecan ophthalmic artery chemosurgery. Patient survival, ocular survival, hematologic toxicity, ocular toxicity, second cancer development and electroretinogram response were all evaluated. 57 carboplatin +/- topotecan infusions (of 111 total) were performed in 31 eyes of 24 patients. The remaining infusions were melphalan-containing. All patients were alive and no patient developed a second malignancy at a median follow up of 25 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of ocular survival at two years was 89.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.1-97.9%) for all eyes. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia developed in two patients and one patient developed metastatic disease. By univariate analysis, neither increasing maximum carboplatin/topotecan dose nor cumulative carboplatin/topotecan dose was associated with statistically significant reduction in the electroretinogram responses.

Favorable modulation of benign breast tissue and serum risk biomarkers is associated with > 10 % weight loss in postmenopausal women.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2013-10-19,"We conducted a phase II feasibility study of a 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention in postmenopausal overweight and obese women at increased risk for breast cancer and the effects of weight loss on anthropomorphic, blood, and benign breast tissue biomarkers. 67 women were screened by random peri-areolar fine-needle aspiration, 27 were registered and 24 participated in the interventional phase. The 24 biomarker evaluable women had a median baseline BMI of 34.2 kg/m(2) and lost a median of 11 % of their initial weight. Significant tissue biomarker modulation after the 6-month intervention was noted for Ki-67 (if restricted to the 15 women with any Ki-67 at baseline, p = 0.041), adiponectin to leptin ratio (p = 0.003); and cyclin B1 (p = 0.001), phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p = 0.005), and ribosomal S6 (p = 0.004) proteins. Favorable modulation for serum markers was observed for sex hormone-binding globulin (p < 0.001), bioavailable estradiol (p < 0.001), bioavailable testosterone (p = 0.033), insulin (p = 0.018), adiponectin (p = 0.001), leptin (p < 0.001), the adiponectin to leptin ratio (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (p = 0.002), and hepatocyte growth factor (p = 0.011). When subdivided by <10 or >10 % weight loss, change in percent total body and android (visceral) fat, physical activity, and the majority of the serum and tissue biomarkers were significantly modulated only for women with >10 % weight loss from baseline. Some factors such as serum PAI-1 and breast tissue pS2 (estrogen-inducible gene) mRNA were not significantly modulated overall but were when considering only those with >10 % weight loss. In conclusion, a median weight loss of 11 % over 6 months resulted in favorable modulation of a number of anthropomorphic, breast tissue and serum risk and mechanistic markers. Weight loss of 10 % or more should likely be the goal for breast cancer risk reduction studies in obese women.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2285.0,34.0,conducted phase II feasibility 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention postmenopausal overweight obese women increased risk breast effects weight loss anthropomorphic blood benign breast tissue biomarkers 67 women screened random peri-areolar fine-needle aspiration 27 registered 24 participated interventional phase 24 biomarker evaluable women median baseline BMI 34.2 kg/m 2 lost median 11 initial weight Significant tissue biomarker modulation 6-month intervention noted Ki-67 restricted 15 women Ki-67 baseline p 0.041 adiponectin leptin ratio p 0.003 cyclin B1 p 0.001 phosphorylated retinoblastoma p 0.005 ribosomal S6 p 0.004 Favorable modulation serum markers observed sex hormone-binding globulin p 0.001 bioavailable estradiol p 0.001 bioavailable testosterone p 0.033 insulin p 0.018 adiponectin p 0.001 leptin p 0.001 adiponectin leptin ratio p 0.001 C-reactive p 0.002 hepatocyte growth factor p 0.011 subdivided 10 10 weight loss change percent total body android visceral fat physical activity majority serum tissue biomarkers significantly modulated women 10 weight loss baseline factors serum PAI-1 breast tissue pS2 estrogen-inducible mRNA significantly modulated overall considering 10 weight loss median weight loss 11 6 months resulted favorable modulation number anthropomorphic breast tissue serum risk mechanistic markers Weight loss 10 likely goal breast risk reduction studies obese women,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 426, 8, 124, 215, 1437, 45, 1, 8, 49, 811, 4166, 924, 407, 788, 4, 1679, 3566, 2, 2209, 117, 28, 101, 43, 9, 12, 2, 3, 176, 1, 924, 407, 23, 26561, 315, 2, 1002, 246, 582, 598, 117, 11, 2261, 20, 2324, 6164, 16096, 2924, 2177, 3256, 428, 11, 1653, 2, 259, 3025, 4, 3, 6182, 124, 3, 259, 901, 859, 117, 42, 8, 52, 330, 1140, 1, 562, 18, 503, 188, 18, 2, 3009, 8, 52, 1, 175, 1, 136, 388, 924, 93, 246, 901, 2356, 50, 3, 49, 811, 788, 10, 1051, 9, 2311, 598, 492, 2016, 6, 3, 167, 117, 5, 500, 2311, 598, 28, 330, 19, 13, 5937, 5384, 6, 6876, 197, 19, 13, 1421, 2, 1226, 7018, 19, 13, 144, 2365, 19, 13, 1614, 2, 8194, 4977, 19, 13, 1520, 652, 913, 2356, 9, 524, 525, 10, 164, 9, 1035, 785, 791, 7819, 19, 13, 144, 6582, 4507, 19, 13, 144, 6582, 2660, 19, 13, 5254, 1601, 19, 13, 4047, 5384, 19, 13, 144, 6876, 19, 13, 144, 3, 5384, 6, 6876, 197, 19, 13, 144, 256, 2163, 178, 19, 13, 1111, 2, 129, 161, 19, 13, 3651, 198, 10676, 20, 79, 15, 79, 924, 407, 707, 4, 714, 181, 642, 2, 35690, 2737, 2300, 900, 128, 2, 3, 686, 1, 3, 524, 2, 246, 582, 11, 97, 1757, 158, 9, 117, 5, 79, 924, 407, 29, 330, 476, 130, 225, 22, 524, 14922, 14, 2, 246, 12848, 808, 2877, 145, 956, 11, 44, 97, 1757, 63, 84, 11, 198, 3075, 158, 135, 5, 79, 924, 407, 4, 1221, 8, 52, 924, 407, 1, 175, 252, 49, 53, 627, 4, 913, 2356, 1, 8, 207, 1, 26561, 246, 2, 524, 43, 2, 2716, 525, 924, 407, 1, 79, 15, 80, 257, 322, 40, 3, 1326, 9, 12, 43, 628, 94, 4, 2209, 117]",1763.0,24141897,Favorable modulation benign breast tissue serum risk biomarkers associated 10 weight loss postmenopausal women,0,0.0
Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) inhibition induces lymphoma cell death through reactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway and polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) silencing.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2013-11-04,"Epigenetic regulation mediated by lysine- and arginine-specific enzymes plays an essential role in tumorigenesis, and enhanced expression of the type II protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as well as the polycomb repressor complex PRC2 has been associated with increased cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that PRMT5 is overexpressed in three different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and clinical samples as well as in mouse primary lymphoma cells and that it up-regulates PRC2 expression through inactivation of the retinoblastoma proteins RB1 and RBL2. Although PRMT5 epigenetically controls RBL2 expression, it indirectly promotes RB1 phosphorylation through enhanced cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 knockdown in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and mouse primary lymphoma cells leads to RBL2 derepression and RB1 reactivation, which in turn inhibit PRC2 expression and trigger derepression of its CASP10, DAP1, HOXA5, and HRK pro-apoptotic target genes. We also show that reduced PRMT5 expression leads to cyclin D1 transcriptional repression via loss of TP53K372 methylation, which results in decreased BCL3 expression and enhanced recruitment of NF-κB p52-HDAC1 repressor complexes to the cyclin D1 promoter. These findings indicate that PRMT5 is a master epigenetic regulator that governs expression of its own target genes and those regulated by PRC2 and that its inhibition could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for lymphoma patients.

Pharmacol.,2013-11-16,"Flavopiridol is primarily a cyclin-dependent kinase-9 inhibitor, and we performed a dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety and generate a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Patients with a diagnosis of relapsed myeloma after at least two prior treatments were included. Flavopiridol was administered as a bolus and then continuous infusion weekly for 4 weeks in a 6-week cycle. Fifteen patients were treated at three dose levels (30 mg/m(2) bolus, 30 mg/m(2) CIV to 50 mg/m(2) bolus, and 50 mg/m(2) CIV). Cytopenias were significant, and elevated transaminases (grade 4 in 3 patients, grade 3 in 4 patients, and grade 2 in 3 patients) were noted but were transient. Diarrhea (grade 3 in 6 patients and grade 2 in 5 patients) did not lead to hospital admission.

Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.,FEBS letters,FEBS Lett.,2013-12-01,"Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma in children and adolescents, as well as liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas in adults. Since GD2 expression in normal tissues is restricted to the brain, which is inaccessible to circulating antibodies, and in selected peripheral nerves and melanocytes, it was deemed a suitable target for systemic tumor immunotherapy. Anti-GD2 antibodies have been actively tested in clinical trials for neuroblastoma for over the past two decades, with proven safety and efficacy. The main limitations have been acute pain toxicity associated with GD2 expression on peripheral nerve fibers and the inability of antibodies to treat bulky tumor. Several strategies have been developed to reduce pain toxicity, including bypassing complement activation, using blocking antibodies, or targeting of O-acetyl-GD2 derivative that is not expressed on peripheral nerves. To enhance anti-tumor efficacy, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and fragments have been engineered into immunocytokines, immunotoxins, antibody drug conjugates, radiolabeled antibodies, targeted nanoparticles, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors. The challenges of these approaches will be reviewed to build a perspective for next generation anti-GD2 therapeutics in cancer therapy.

Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) as surveillance for subsequent malignancies in survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma: a pilot study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-11-01,"Individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma (RB) are at very high risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) of which osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common. We hypothesized that annual surveillance using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) in asymptomatic survivors of hereditary RB would detect SMN of the bone and soft tissues at an early stage. Retrospective review of the results of a WB-MRI screening program in hereditary RB survivors from February 2008 to August 2012. The primary outcome was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI in detecting SMNs. Twenty-five patients had at least one WB-MRI performed (range: 1-5). First WB-MRI was performed at a median age of 16 years (range: 8-25 years). WB-MRI detected new osseous abnormalities suspicious for malignancy in five patients: two were diagnosed with localized high-grade OS of the extremity and three were found to have benign osseous abnormalities after dedicated imaging (n = 5/5) and/or biopsy (n = 3/5). One patient was diagnosed with secondary OS 3 months after a normal screening WB-MRI exam. Among a total of 41 WB-MRI screening tests performed in survivors of hereditary RB, the sensitivity of detecting SMN was 66.7% and the specificity was 92.1%. Preliminary results suggest that annual WB-MRI surveillance detects SMN in survivors of hereditary RB, but with modest sensitivity.

Electroretinogram monitoring of dose-dependent toxicity after ophthalmic artery chemosurgery in retinoblastoma eyes: six year review.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2014-01-20,"To report electroretinogram responses of retinoblastoma children under anesthesia before and after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs (melphalan, topotecan, carboplatin) delivery by ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). A cohort study of 81 patients with retinoblastoma treated with OAC. All patients treated with OAC at our center through May 2012 for whom the requisite ERG data were available are included in the analysis. This study recorded the ERG 30 Hz flicker amplitude response changes from baseline, at 3 and 12 months following OAC treatment completion. Both univariate and multivariate linear regression models were evaluated, with generalized estimating equations to correct for correlations within patients. Independent numerical variables included maximum doses and cumulative doses of melphalan, topotecan and carboplatin. By univariate analysis, both melphalan and topotecan appear to be associated with changes in ERG amplitude at both 3 and 12 months; but for the most part, these changes are minimal and likely clinically insignificant. By multivariate analysis, maximum and cumulative melphalan have a modest, temporary effect on the ERG amplitude change, which is apparent at 3 months but no longer evident at 12 months after completing treatment. By multivariate analysis, topotecan and carboplatin do not appear to adversely effect the change in ERG response. Melphalan has the strongest, and carboplatin the weakest association with reduction in ERG response amplitudes; but for the most part, these changes are minimal and likely clinically insignificant.

RB1 gene inactivation by chromothripsis in human retinoblastoma.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2014-01-01,"Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the developing retina. Most retinoblastomas initiate with biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene through diverse mechanisms including point mutations, nucleotide insertions, deletions, loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation. Recently, a novel mechanism of retinoblastoma initiation was proposed. Gallie and colleagues discovered that a small proportion of retinoblastomas lack RB1 mutations and had MYCN amplification [1]. In this study, we identified recurrent chromosomal, regional and focal genomic lesions in 94 primary retinoblastomas with their matched normal DNA using SNP 6.0 chips. We also analyzed the RB1 gene mutations and compared the mechanism of RB1 inactivation to the recurrent copy number variations in the retinoblastoma genome. In addition to the previously described focal amplification of MYCN and deletions in RB1 and BCOR, we also identified recurrent focal amplification of OTX2, a transcription factor required for retinal photoreceptor development. We identified 10 retinoblastomas in our cohort that lacked RB1 point mutations or indels. We performed whole genome sequencing on those 10 tumors and their corresponding germline DNA. In one of the tumors, the RB1 gene was unaltered, the MYCN gene was amplified and RB1 protein was expressed in the nuclei of the tumor cells.

"The landscape of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators across 1,000 paediatric cancer genomes.",Nature communications,Nat Commun,2014-04-08,"Studies of paediatric cancers have shown a high frequency of mutation across epigenetic regulators. Here we sequence 633 genes, encoding the majority of known epigenetic regulatory proteins, in over 1,000 paediatric tumours to define the landscape of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators in paediatric cancer. Our results demonstrate a marked variation in the frequency of gene mutations across 21 different paediatric cancer subtypes, with the highest frequency of mutations detected in high-grade gliomas, T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and medulloblastoma, and a paucity of mutations in low-grade glioma and retinoblastoma. The most frequently mutated genes are H3F3A, PHF6, ATRX, KDM6A, SMARCA4, ASXL2, CREBBP, EZH2, MLL2, USP7, ASXL1, NSD2, SETD2, SMC1A and ZMYM3. We identify novel loss-of-function mutations in the ubiquitin-specific processing protease 7 (USP7) in paediatric leukaemia, which result in decreased deubiquitination activity. Collectively, our results help to define the landscape of mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes in paediatric cancer and yield a valuable new database for investigating the role of epigenetic dysregulations in cancer.

"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer: subtypes, biology, and clinical outcomes.",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2014-05-01,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) encompasses various clinical contexts, ranging from the de novo presentation of small cell prostatic carcinoma to a treatment-emergent transformed phenotype that arises from typical adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The development of resistance to potent androgen receptor signaling inhibition may be associated with the emergence of aggressive phenotype, advanced castration-resistant NEPC. Clinically, small cell prostate cancer and NEPC are often manifested by the presence of visceral or large soft tissue metastatic disease, a disproportionately low serum prostate-specific antigen level relative to the overall burden of disease, and a limited response to targeting of the androgen signaling axis. These tumors are often characterized by loss of androgen receptor expression, loss of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor copy number or expression, amplification of Aurora kinase A and N-Myc, and activation of the PI3K pathway. However, a consensus phenotype-genotype definition of NEPC has yet to emerge, and molecularly based biomarkers are needed to expand on traditional morphologic and immunohistochemical markers of NEPC to fully define the spectrum of this aggressive, androgen receptor-independent disease. Emerging studies implicate a shared clonal origin with prostatic adenocarcinoma in many cases, with the adaptive emergence of unique cellular programming and gene expression profiles. Ongoing clinical studies are focused on developing novel targeted therapeutic approaches for this high-risk, lethal subset of disease, to improve on the limited durations of response often observed with traditional platinum-based chemotherapy.

Inhibition of Cdk2 kinase activity selectively targets the CD44⁺/CD24⁻/Low stem-like subpopulation and restores chemosensitivity of SUM149PT triple-negative breast cancer cells.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2014-06-25,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an angioinvasive and most aggressive type of advanced breast cancer characterized by rapid proliferation, chemoresistance, early metastatic development and poor prognosis. IBC tumors display a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype characterized by centrosome amplification, high grade of chromosomal instability (CIN) and low levels of expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 tyrosine kinase receptor. Since the TNBC cells lack these receptors necessary to promote tumor growth, common treatments such as endocrine therapy and molecular targeting of HER-2 receptor are ineffective for this subtype of breast cancer. To date, not a single targeted therapy has been approved for non-inflammatory and inflammatory TNBC tumors and combination of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents remains the standard therapy. IBC tumors generally display activation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is functionally linked to a CD44+/CD24-/Low stem-like phenotype. Development of EMT and consequent activation of stemness programming is responsible for invasion, tumor self-renewal and drug resistance leading to breast cancer progression, distant metastases and poor prognosis. In this study, we employed the luminal ER+ MCF-7 and the IBC SUM149PT breast cancer cell lines to establish the extent to which high grade of CIN and chemoresistance were mechanistically linked to the enrichment of CD44+/CD24low/- CSCs. Here, we demonstrate that SUM149PT cells displayed higher CIN than MCF-7 cells characterized by higher percentage of structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations. Moreover, centrosome amplification, cyclin E overexpression and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) were restricted to the stem-like CD44+/CD24-/Low subpopulation isolated from SUM149PT cells. Significantly, CD44+/CD24-/Low CSCs displayed resistance to conventional chemotherapy but higher sensitivity to SU9516, a specific cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) inhibitor, demonstrating that aberrant activation of cyclin E/Cdk2 oncogenic signaling is essential for the maintenance and expansion of CD44+/CD24-/Low CSC subpopulation in IBC.

Antiproliferative effects of CDK4/6 inhibition in CDK4-amplified human liposarcoma in vitro and in vivo.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2014-07-15,"Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WD/DDLPS) are among the most common subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas. Conventional systemic chemotherapy has limited efficacy and novel therapeutic strategies are needed to achieve better outcomes for patients. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene is highly amplified in more than 95% of WD/DDLPS. In this study, we explored the role of CDK4 and the effects of NVP-LEE011 (LEE011), a novel selective inhibitor of CDK4/CDK6, on a panel of human liposarcoma cell lines and primary tumor xenografts. We found that both CDK4 knockdown by siRNA and inhibition by LEE011 diminished retinoblastoma (RB) phosphorylation and dramatically decreased liposarcoma cell growth. Cell-cycle analysis demonstrated arrest at G0-G1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RB rescued the inhibitory effects of LEE011, demonstrating that LEE011 decreased proliferation through RB. Oral administration of LEE011 to mice bearing human liposarcoma xenografts resulted in approximately 50% reduction in tumor (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with decreased tumor biomarkers, including RB phosphorylation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo. Continued treatment inhibited tumor growth or induced regression without detrimental effects on mouse weight. After prolonged continuous dosing, reestablishment of RB phosphorylation and cell-cycle progression was noted. These findings validate the critical role of CDK4 in maintaining liposarcoma proliferation through its ability to inactivate RB function, and suggest its potential function in the regulation of survival and metabolism of liposarcoma, supporting the rationale for clinical development of LEE011 for the treatment of WD/DDLPS.",Journal Article,2016.0,68.0,Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas WD/DDLPS common subtypes soft tissue sarcomas Conventional systemic chemotherapy limited efficacy novel therapeutic strategies needed achieve better outcomes patients cyclin-dependent kinase 4 CDK4 highly amplified 95 WD/DDLPS explored role CDK4 effects NVP-LEE011 LEE011 novel selective inhibitor CDK4/CDK6 panel human liposarcoma lines primary xenografts CDK4 knockdown siRNA inhibition LEE011 diminished retinoblastoma RB phosphorylation dramatically decreased liposarcoma growth Cell-cycle demonstrated arrest G0-G1 siRNA-mediated knockdown RB rescued inhibitory effects LEE011 demonstrating LEE011 decreased proliferation RB Oral administration LEE011 mice bearing human liposarcoma xenografts resulted approximately 50 reduction 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake decreased biomarkers including RB phosphorylation bromodeoxyuridine incorporation vivo Continued treatment inhibited growth induced regression detrimental effects mouse weight prolonged continuous dosing reestablishment RB phosphorylation cell-cycle progression noted findings validate critical role CDK4 maintaining liposarcoma proliferation ability inactivate RB function suggest potential function regulation survival metabolism liposarcoma supporting rationale clinical development LEE011 treatment WD/DDLPS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[149, 1442, 6275, 7880, 10367, 7836, 32, 107, 3, 96, 186, 814, 1, 1214, 246, 1479, 809, 403, 56, 71, 383, 209, 2, 229, 189, 422, 32, 575, 6, 1359, 380, 123, 9, 7, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 39, 3254, 145, 16, 561, 2429, 4, 80, 76, 48, 1, 10367, 7836, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1443, 3, 200, 1, 3254, 2, 3, 176, 1, 5678, 18081, 18081, 8, 229, 1094, 230, 1, 3254, 9518, 23, 8, 993, 1, 171, 3259, 31, 285, 2, 86, 30, 1348, 21, 204, 17, 110, 3254, 1563, 20, 1919, 2, 297, 20, 18081, 2849, 2955, 982, 2, 2729, 340, 3259, 31, 129, 31, 417, 65, 264, 1854, 28, 8588, 3344, 1919, 517, 1563, 1, 2955, 7008, 3, 1810, 176, 1, 18081, 2219, 17, 18081, 340, 457, 298, 2955, 518, 634, 1, 18081, 6, 399, 1894, 171, 3259, 1348, 627, 4, 705, 212, 628, 4, 30, 203, 1068, 4085, 1135, 5, 340, 30, 582, 141, 2955, 982, 2, 19592, 2838, 4, 386, 1351, 24, 879, 30, 129, 15, 277, 320, 187, 6227, 176, 23, 830, 924, 50, 1069, 1314, 1280, 48475, 1, 2955, 982, 2, 31, 417, 91, 10, 1051, 46, 272, 2183, 3, 740, 200, 1, 3254, 4, 3284, 3259, 457, 298, 211, 801, 6, 13772, 2955, 343, 2, 309, 211, 174, 343, 4, 3, 863, 1, 25, 2, 1600, 1, 3259, 1912, 3, 1728, 9, 38, 193, 1, 18081, 9, 3, 24, 1, 10367, 7836]",1668.0,25028469,Antiproliferative effects CDK4/6 inhibition CDK4-amplified human liposarcoma vitro vivo,1,0.005154639175257732
The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor modulates DNA repair and radioresponsiveness.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-08-27,"Perturbations in the retinoblastoma pathway are over-represented in advanced prostate cancer; retinoblastoma loss promotes bypass of first-line hormone therapy. Conversely, preliminary studies suggested that retinoblastoma-deficient tumors may become sensitized to a subset of DNA-damaging agents. Here, the molecular and in vivo consequence of retinoblastoma status was analyzed in models of clinical relevance. Experimental work was performed with multiple isogenic prostate cancer cell lines (hormone sensitive: LNCaP and LAPC4 cells and hormone resistant C42, 22Rv1 cells; stable knockdown of retinoblastoma using shRNA). Multiple mechanisms were interrogated including cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. Transcriptome analysis was performed, validated, and mechanisms discerned. Cell survival was measured using clonogenic cell survival assay and in vivo analysis was performed in nude mice with human derived tumor xenografts. Loss of retinoblastoma enhanced the radioresponsiveness of both hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation was not mediated by cell cycle or p53. Retinoblastoma loss led to alteration in DNA damage repair and activation of the NF-κB pathway and subsequent cellular apoptosis through PLK3. In vivo xenografts of retinoblastoma-deficient tumors exhibited diminished tumor mass, lower PSA kinetics, and decreased tumor growth after treatment with ionizing radiation (P < 0.05). Loss of retinoblastoma confers increased radiosensitivity in prostate cancer. This hypersensitization was mediated by alterations in apoptotic signaling. Combined, these not only provide insight into the molecular consequence of retinoblastoma loss, but also credential retinoblastoma status as a putative biomarker for predicting response to radiotherapy.",Journal Article,1973.0,9.0,Perturbations retinoblastoma pathway over-represented advanced prostate retinoblastoma loss promotes bypass first-line hormone therapy Conversely preliminary studies suggested retinoblastoma-deficient sensitized subset DNA-damaging agents molecular vivo consequence retinoblastoma status models clinical relevance Experimental work performed multiple isogenic prostate lines hormone sensitive LNCaP LAPC4 hormone resistant C42 22Rv1 stable knockdown retinoblastoma shRNA Multiple mechanisms interrogated including cycle apoptosis DNA damage repair Transcriptome performed validated mechanisms discerned survival measured clonogenic survival vivo performed nude mice human derived xenografts Loss retinoblastoma enhanced radioresponsiveness hormone-sensitive castrate-resistant prostate Hypersensitivity ionizing radiation mediated cycle p53 Retinoblastoma loss led alteration DNA damage repair activation NF-κB pathway subsequent cellular apoptosis PLK3 vivo xenografts retinoblastoma-deficient exhibited diminished mass lower PSA kinetics decreased growth treatment ionizing radiation P 0.05 Loss retinoblastoma confers increased radiosensitivity prostate hypersensitization mediated alterations apoptotic signaling Combined provide insight molecular consequence retinoblastoma loss credential retinoblastoma status putative biomarker predicting response radiotherapy,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7013, 4, 3, 308, 32, 252, 3324, 4, 131, 12, 407, 2148, 5481, 1, 157, 328, 785, 36, 3154, 1676, 94, 1148, 17, 18175, 1971, 57, 68, 1417, 4242, 6, 8, 697, 1, 261, 4904, 183, 467, 3, 219, 2, 4, 386, 4177, 1, 156, 10, 311, 4, 274, 1, 38, 2088, 1560, 1357, 10, 173, 5, 232, 7208, 12, 31, 285, 785, 745, 3530, 2, 20319, 37, 2, 785, 436, 64815, 15878, 37, 585, 1563, 1, 75, 3976, 232, 483, 11, 7227, 141, 31, 417, 351, 2, 261, 1350, 972, 3917, 65, 10, 173, 938, 2, 483, 19767, 31, 25, 10, 644, 75, 3798, 31, 25, 719, 2, 4, 386, 65, 10, 173, 4, 2598, 399, 5, 171, 526, 30, 1348, 407, 1, 651, 3, 38701, 1, 110, 785, 745, 2, 4435, 436, 12, 4034, 6, 4341, 121, 10, 44, 517, 20, 31, 417, 15, 624, 407, 836, 6, 2611, 4, 261, 1350, 972, 2, 363, 1, 3, 1365, 2448, 308, 2, 706, 763, 351, 298, 64816, 4, 386, 1348, 1, 18175, 1971, 57, 1416, 2849, 30, 782, 280, 534, 3839, 2, 340, 30, 129, 50, 24, 5, 4341, 121, 19, 13, 474, 407, 1, 4020, 101, 5850, 4, 12, 26, 64817, 10, 517, 20, 593, 4, 1631, 314, 397, 46, 44, 158, 377, 2670, 237, 3, 219, 4177, 1, 407, 84, 120, 31966, 156, 22, 8, 2743, 901, 9, 1434, 51, 6, 310]",1624.0,25165096,retinoblastoma suppressor modulates DNA repair radioresponsiveness,0,0.0
Integrating stages of change models to cast new vision on interventions to improve global retinoblastoma and childhood cancer outcomes.,BMC public health,BMC Public Health,2014-09-11,"Retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular tumor globally, represents a curable cancer when diagnosed early and treated promptly. Delay to diagnosis, lag time prior to treatment initiation, and abandonment of treatment including upfront treatment refusal, represent stark causes of high retinoblastoma mortality rates in low- and middle- income settings, particularly regions in Africa. While a health delivery-based approach has been a historic focus of retinoblastoma treatments globally and is essential to quality care, this is necessary but not adequate. Retinoblastoma is a compelling disease model to illustrate the potential insights afforded in theory-informed approaches to improve outcomes that integrate public health and oncology perspectives, prioritizing both health service delivery and social efficacy for cure. Given that barriers to appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment represent main contributors to mortality in children with retinoblastoma in resource-limited settings such as certain areas in Africa, an important priority is to overcome barriers to cure that may be predominantly socially influenced, alongside health delivery-based improvements. While Stages of Change models have been effectively utilized in cancer screening programs within settings of economic and cultural barriers, this application of health behavior theory has been limited to cancer screening rather than a comprehensive framework for treatment completion. Using retinoblastoma as a case example, we propose applying stage-based intervention models in critical stages of care, such as the Precaution Adoption Process Model to decrease delay to diagnosis and a Transtheoretical Model to increase treatment completion rates in resource-limited settings. Stage-based theories recognize that improved cure and survival outcomes will require supportive strategies to progress households, communities, and social and economic institutions from being unaware and unengaged to committed and sustained in their respective roles.

Risk factors for severe neutropenia following intra-arterial chemotherapy for intra-ocular retinoblastoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2014-10-10,"Intra-arterial chemotherapy is a promising strategy for intra-ocular retinoblastoma. Neutropenia is the most commonly encountered systemic toxicity and in this study we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with the development of severe (≥ grade 3) neutropenia. Retrospective review of 187 evaluable cycles of melphalan-containing intra-arterial chemotherapy from the first three cycles administered to 106 patients with intra-ocular retinoblastoma from May 2006 to June 2011. Cycles were considered to be evaluable if (1) blood count results were available in the 7 to 14 days post-treatment interval and (2) concurrent intravenous chemotherapy was not administered. Toxicity was assessed via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. 54 cycles (29%) were associated with grade 3 (n = 43) or grade 4 (n = 11) neutropenia. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression revealed that a higher melphalan dose (>0.40 mg/kg) was significantly associated with severe neutropenia during all 3 cycles (odds ratio during cycle one 4.11, 95% confidence interval 1.33-12.73, p = 0.01), but the addition of topotecan and/or carboplatin were not. Prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy was not associated with severe neutropenia risk in any analysis.

Cognitive function and social attainment in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: a report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-11-24,"Retinoblastoma has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 95%, yet little is known about long-term functional outcomes for these patients. Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at ≤1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (β = 0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (β = 0.66, P = .02), verbal learning (β = 0.67, P = .02), and verbal reasoning abilities (β = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at >1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (β = -0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (β = -0.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations.

Cancer Res.,2014-12-11,"The G1-S checkpoint of the cell cycle is frequently dysregulated in breast cancer. Palbociclib (PD0332991) is an oral inhibitor of CDK4/6. Based upon preclinical/phase I activity, we performed a phase II, single-arm trial of palbociclib in advanced breast cancer. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, metastatic breast cancer positive for retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and measureable disease. Palbociclib was given at 125 mg orally on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Primary objectives were tumor response and tolerability. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS) and assessment of Rb expression/localization, KI-67, p16 loss, and CCND1 amplification. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled; 84% hormone-receptor (HR)(+)/Her2(-), 5% HR(+)/Her2(+), and 11% HR(-)/Her2(-), with a median of 2 prior cytotoxic regimens. Two patients had partial response (PR) and 5 had stable disease ≥ 6 months for a clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + 6moSD) of 19% overall, 21% in HR(+), and 29% in HR(+)/Her2(-) who had progressed through ≥2 prior lines of hormonal therapy. Median PFS overall was 3.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.9-5.1], but significantly longer for those with HR(+) versus HR(-) disease (P = 0.03) and those who had previously progressed through endocrine therapy for advanced disease (P = 0.02).

Phase 2 trial of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in patients with retinoblastoma protein-expressing germ cell tumors.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-12-18,"Alterations in the retinoblastoma pathway in germ cell tumors (GCTs) have been described. In the phase 1 trials of the selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, 3 patients with unresectable, growing, mature teratoma syndrome achieved prolonged disease stabilization. The authors conducted an open-label, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in patients with incurable, refractory, retinoblastoma protein (pRB)-expressing GCTs. Patients who had incurable, refractory GCTs that demonstrated pRB expression by immunohistochemistry received oral palbociclib 125 mg daily for 21 days followed by a 7-day break. The primary endpoint was the 24-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A 24-week PFS rate ≥15% was considered promising, and a PFS rate ≤5% was not considered promising. Thirty patients received treatment, and 29 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The estimated 24-week PFS rate was 28% (90% exact confidence interval, 15%-44%). Patients who had teratoma and teratoma with malignant transformation had significantly better PFS than patients who had nonteratomatous GCTs. Toxicity was manageable and was principally hematologic. Treatment with palbociclib was associated with a favorable 24-week PFS rate in patients with refractory, pRB-expressing GCTs.

This study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of second-course OAC. Single-arm retrospective study of 29 eyes of 30 patients treated with second-course OAC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between May 2006 and July 2013, with a median follow-up of 25.9 months. Retinoblastoma patients who underwent a course of OAC, with a minimum of 2 months of progression-free follow-up at monthly examinations, but who subsequently received additional OAC for recurrent tumor. To determine efficacy, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were generated and the Mantel-Cox test was used to compare curves. To determine toxicity, electroretinography (ERG) amplitudes were measured in response to 30-Hz photopic flicker stimulation before and after OAC treatment; systemic adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0). For efficacy, ocular progression-free survival, ocular event-free survival (e.g., enucleation, external-beam radiation, or intravitreal melphalan), and ocular survival. For toxicity, peak-to-peak comparisons between ERG studies before and after OAC treatment and CTCAE 4.0-graded systemic adverse events. Fifty percent of all recurrences were within 4.4 months and 90% were within 16 months of completion of the first course of OAC. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier ocular survival, event-free survival, and progression-free survival estimates after second-course OAC were 82.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.1%-93.2%), 57.3% (95% CI, 36.1%-73.7%), and 26.5% (95% CI, 11.0%-45.0%), respectively. All eyes without vitreous seeding were progression free, whereas eyes with vitreous seeding were associated significantly with worse ocular survival after second-course OAC (P = 0.03). After second-course OAC, 90% of eyes had stable or improved ERG responses. Of all evaluable cases, there was no increased risk of systemic toxicity during the second course compared with the initial course of OAC. Retinoblastoma eyes requiring second-course OAC after initial OAC treatment have good salvage rates, and the treatment has an acceptable ocular and systemic toxicity profile.

Evasion of anti-growth signaling: A key step in tumorigenesis and potential target for treatment and prophylaxis by natural compounds.,Seminars in cancer biology,Semin. Cancer Biol.,2015-03-06,"The evasion of anti-growth signaling is an important characteristic of cancer cells. In order to continue to proliferate, cancer cells must somehow uncouple themselves from the many signals that exist to slow down cell growth. Here, we define the anti-growth signaling process, and review several important pathways involved in growth signaling: p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Hippo, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), Notch, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) pathways. Aberrations in these processes in cancer cells involve mutations and thus the suppression of genes that prevent growth, as well as mutation and activation of genes involved in driving cell growth. Using these pathways as examples, we prioritize molecular targets that might be leveraged to promote anti-growth signaling in cancer cells. Interestingly, naturally occurring phytochemicals found in human diets (either singly or as mixtures) may promote anti-growth signaling, and do so without the potentially adverse effects associated with synthetic chemicals. We review examples of naturally occurring phytochemicals that may be applied to prevent cancer by antagonizing growth signaling, and propose one phytochemical for each pathway. These are: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for the Rb pathway, luteolin for p53, curcumin for PTEN, porphyrins for Hippo, genistein for GDF15, resveratrol for ARID1A, withaferin A for Notch and diguelin for the IGF1-receptor pathway. The coordination of anti-growth signaling and natural compound studies will provide insight into the future application of these compounds in the clinical setting.

RB loss in resistant EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinomas that transform to small-cell lung cancer.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2015-03-11,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective treatments for non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, relapse typically occurs after an average of 1 year of continuous treatment. A fundamental histological transformation from NSCLC to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of tumour samples and cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant patients revealed that Retinoblastoma (RB) is lost in 100% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC. Further, increased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared with resistant NSCLCs. Together, these findings suggest that this subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of classical SCLC.

Retinoblastoma.,Journal of child neurology,J. Child Neurol.,2015-05-28,"Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. It typically presents with leukocoria or strabismus. In later stages of the disease, the child may exhibit proptosis, buphthalmos, or hypopyon. The pathognomonic molecular aberration is a loss of function mutation in the RB1 gene on chromosome 13q. The degree of tumor involvement within the eye is defined by its group. Grouping was historically done with Reese-Ellsworth System. Recent therapeutic advances have led to the development of a new grouping system, the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB). In cases of extraocular extension and metastatic disease, the degree of tumor involvement outside of the eye is defined by its stage. Retinoblastoma is staged using the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS). Children with intraocular retinoblastoma have an excellent overall and ocular survival. In order to avoid the morbidity of enucleation and external beam radiation, treatments for isolated intraocular retinoblastoma have progressively moved toward targeted local modalities. Patients with extraocular involvement, such as those with trilateral retinoblastoma, have a poorer prognosis. The majority of these higher stage patients are now able to be cured with combination chemotherapy.

To our knowledge, the incidence of orbital recurrence in eyes treated with OAC has not been described. To determine the incidence of orbital recurrence following enucleation or OAC as primary treatments for advanced-stage retinoblastoma. Single-institution cohort study with retrospective record review at an academic ophthalmic oncology practice. A total of 140 eyes in 135 patients who presented between February 14, 2006, and March 4, 2014, and were classified as having Reese-Ellsworth group 5 or International Classification of Retinoblastoma (Children's Oncology Group) group D or E retinoblastoma were included; 63 patients (63 eyes) were primarily treated with enucleation and 72 patients (77 eyes) were primarily treated with OAC. This analysis was conducted between August 1, 2014, and March 1, 2015. Incidence of and time to orbital recurrence, metastasis, and death. There were 5 orbital recurrences (incidence, 7.9%) in the primary enucleation group and 1 orbital recurrence (incidence, 1.3%) in the primary OAC group during median follow-up times of 42.6 months (range, 6.2-97.1 months) and 38.7 months (range, 9.0-104.3 months), respectively. The 24-month Kaplan-Meier estimate for orbital recurrence-free survival was worse for the enucleation group (92.1%; 95% CI, 82.0-96.7) than for the OAC group (100%) (log-rank test, P = .049). The enucleation group had 5 cases of metastatic disease (7.9%) and 2 deaths (3.2%). In the OAC group, there were 3 cases of metastatic disease (4.2%) and no deaths. Kaplan-Meier analysis of metastasis-free survival and overall survival yielded no differences between the 2 treatment groups. Analysis of a number of features of the 2 groups revealed more eyes with iris neovascularization in the enucleation group (25.4%) than in the OAC group (5.2%) and more eyes with group E retinoblastoma in the enucleation group (87.3%) than in the OAC group (29.9%), although neither of these factors was an independent predictor of orbital relapse in a Cox proportional hazards model. In this single-institution retrospective study of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma, there were more orbital recurrences in the group primarily treated with enucleation.

Psychosocial Outcomes in Adult Survivors of Retinoblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-09-28,"Survival rates for individuals diagnosed with retinoblastoma (RB) exceed 95% in the United States; however, little is known about the long-term psychosocial outcomes of these survivors. Adult RB survivors, diagnosed from 1932 to 1994 and treated in New York, completed a comprehensive questionnaire adapted from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), by mail or telephone. Psychosocial outcomes included psychological distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, fear of cancer recurrence, satisfaction with facial appearance, post-traumatic growth, and post-traumatic stress symptoms; noncancer CCSS siblings served as a comparison group. A total of 470 RB survivors (53.6% with bilateral RB; 52.1% female) and 2,820 CCSS siblings were 43.3 (standard deviation [SD], 11) years and 33.2 (SD, 8.4) years old at the time of study, respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, RB survivors did not have significantly higher rates of depression, somatization, distress, or anxiety compared with CCSS siblings. Although RB survivors were more likely to report post-traumatic stress symptoms of avoidance and/or hyperarousal (both P < .01), only five (1.1%) of 470 met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. Among survivors, having a chronic medical condition did not increase the likelihood of psychological problems. Bilateral RB survivors were more likely than unilateral RB survivors to experience fears of cancer recurrence (P < .01) and worry about their children being diagnosed with RB (P < .01).

Deletion of Rb1 induces both hyperproliferation and cell death in murine germinal center B cells.,Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2015-12-01,"The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in multiple myeloma (MM), yet its role remains unclear because in the majority of cases with 13q14 deletions, un-mutated RB1 remains expressed from the retained allele. To explore the role of Rb1 in MM, we examined the functional consequences of single- and double-copy Rb1 loss in germinal center B cells, the cells of origin of MM. We generated mice without Rb1 function in germinal center B cells by crossing Rb1(Flox/Flox) with C-γ-1-Cre (Cγ1) mice expressing the Cre recombinase in class-switched B cells in a p107(-/-) background to prevent p107 from compensating for Rb1 loss (Cγ1-Rb1(F/F)-p107(-/-)). All mice developed normally, but B cells with two copies of Rb1 deleted (Cγ1-Rb1(F/F)-p107(-/-)) exhibited increased proliferation and cell death compared with Cγ1-Rb1(+/+)-p107(-/-) controls ex vivo. In vivo, Cγ1-Rb1(F/F)-p107(-/-) mice had a lower percentage of splenic B220+ cells and reduced numbers of bone marrow antigen-specific secreting cells compared with control mice. Our data indicate that Rb1 loss induces both cell proliferation and death in germinal center B cells. Because no B-cell malignancies developed after 1 year of observation, our data also suggest that Rb1 loss is not sufficient to transform post-germinal center B cells and that additional, specific mutations are likely required to cooperate with Rb1 loss to induce malignant transformation.",Journal Article,1512.0,3.0,retinoblastoma RB1 implicated suppressor multiple myeloma MM role remains unclear majority cases 13q14 deletions un-mutated RB1 remains expressed retained allele explore role Rb1 MM examined functional consequences single- double-copy Rb1 loss germinal center B origin MM generated mice Rb1 function germinal center B crossing Rb1 Flox/Flox C-γ-1-Cre Cγ1 mice expressing Cre recombinase class-switched B p107 -/- background prevent p107 compensating Rb1 loss Cγ1-Rb1 F/F -p107 -/- mice developed normally B copies Rb1 deleted Cγ1-Rb1 F/F -p107 -/- exhibited increased proliferation death compared Cγ1-Rb1 +/+ -p107 -/- controls ex vivo vivo Cγ1-Rb1 F/F -p107 -/- mice lower percentage splenic B220+ reduced numbers bone marrow antigen-specific secreting compared control mice indicate Rb1 loss induces proliferation death germinal center B B-cell malignancies developed 1 year observation suggest Rb1 loss sufficient transform post-germinal center B additional specific likely required cooperate Rb1 loss induce malignant transformation,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 145, 4596, 71, 85, 1771, 22, 8, 30, 1245, 4, 232, 321, 1145, 211, 200, 469, 1200, 408, 4, 3, 686, 1, 140, 5, 13221, 2439, 17157, 1185, 4596, 469, 570, 29, 3, 3532, 1254, 6, 1645, 3, 200, 1, 4596, 4, 321, 21, 409, 3, 583, 3255, 1, 226, 2, 1627, 1337, 4596, 407, 4, 6312, 574, 132, 37, 3, 37, 1, 1938, 1, 321, 21, 1419, 399, 187, 4596, 343, 4, 6312, 574, 132, 37, 20, 15117, 4596, 16112, 16112, 5, 256, 2655, 14, 7102, 32524, 399, 1046, 3, 7102, 23393, 4, 1040, 7883, 132, 37, 4, 8, 16865, 2426, 6, 1682, 16865, 29, 38447, 9, 4596, 407, 32524, 4596, 1068, 1068, 16865, 62, 399, 276, 6150, 84, 132, 37, 5, 100, 5127, 1, 4596, 4389, 32524, 4596, 1068, 1068, 16865, 1416, 101, 457, 2, 31, 273, 72, 5, 32524, 4596, 16865, 535, 2581, 386, 4, 386, 32524, 4596, 1068, 1068, 16865, 399, 42, 8, 280, 1150, 1, 5237, 67232, 37, 2, 405, 1870, 1, 581, 448, 112, 5052, 37, 72, 5, 182, 399, 114, 74, 1008, 17, 4596, 407, 1516, 110, 31, 457, 2, 273, 4, 6312, 574, 132, 37, 408, 77, 132, 31, 441, 276, 50, 14, 111, 1, 1664, 114, 74, 120, 309, 17, 4596, 407, 16, 44, 1952, 6, 7136, 539, 6312, 574, 132, 37, 2, 17, 402, 112, 138, 32, 322, 616, 6, 8647, 5, 4596, 407, 6, 1290, 393, 1392]",1392.0,26607597,Deletion Rb1 induces hyperproliferation death murine germinal center B,0,0.0

It assesses the efficacy and toxicity of intravitreal melphalan for nonvitreous retinoblastoma. This observational small case series investigates three patients treated with intravitreal melphalan for nonvitreous retinoblastoma that was refractory to multiple-course ophthalmic artery chemosurgery. Patients' demographics, response to treatment, and toxicity of treatment as clinically evaluated are measured by electroretinogram. Three eyes of three patients received a median of 7 weekly intravitreal melphalan injections (30 μg/0.07 cc) for persistent retinal or subretinal tumors refractory to treatment with multiple-course ophthalmic artery chemosurgery. Eyes remain tumor free at a median of 14-month follow-up. One eye was enucleated because of a vitreous hemorrhage that obscured fundus details. One eye had extinguished electroretinogram recordings before injections and two eyes had a decrease in electroretinogram responses over the intravitreal treatment course. The eye with subretinal seeding demonstrated marked retinopathy by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography and one eye was enucleated because of the development of a vitreous hemorrhage.

Palbociclib (PD0332991)-a Selective and Potent Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor: A Review of Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Development.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2016-02-01,"Palbociclib (PD0332991) is a newly developed drug that received breakthrough designation and recent US Food and Drug Administration approval in combination with endocrine therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor positive, ERBB2-negative (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) breast cancer in the first-line metastatic setting. Herein we describe the preclinical and translational data and early- and late-phase clinical trials in which palbociclib has been investigated in a broad array of tumor types. We discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxic effects, and clinical response rates. On March 1, 2015, we conducted a review of the literature describing the development of palbociclib. We used the PubMed search terms ""PD0332991,"" ""palbociclib,"" and ""CDK4/6 inhibitor"" to find all published articles of interest, without limitation as to publication date. Palbociclib is a potent and specific oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor that has strong preclinical data to support its activity in retinoblastoma protein-expressing tumors. Phase 1 trials have demonstrated safety, and phase 2 trials have shown single-agent activity in mantle-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, liposarcoma, and teratoma with reversible neutropenia as the main toxic effect. Addition of palbociclib to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in endocrine therapy-naïve and endocrine therapy-resistant metastatic settings. Palbociclib is well tolerated and has therapeutic potential for multiple cancers, including breast cancer, where its efficacy has been demonstrated alone and in combination with endocrine therapy.

Targeting CDK4 and CDK6: From Discovery to Therapy.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2015-12-11,"Biochemical and genetic characterization of D-type cyclins, their cyclin D-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), and the polypeptide CDK4/6 inhibitor p16(INK4)over two decades ago revealed how mammalian cells regulate entry into the DNA synthetic (S) phase of the cell-division cycle in a retinoblastoma protein-dependent manner. These investigations provided proof-of-principle that CDK4/6 inhibitors, particularly when combined with coinhibition of allied mitogen-dependent signal transduction pathways, might prove valuable in cancer therapy. FDA approval of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib used with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for breast cancer treatment highlights long-sought success.

Advanced Unilateral Retinoblastoma: The Impact of Ophthalmic Artery Chemosurgery on Enucleation Rate and Patient Survival at MSKCC.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-12-28,"To report on the influence of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) on enucleation rates, ocular and patient survival from metastasis and impact on practice patterns at Memorial Sloan Kettering for children with advanced intraocular unilateral retinoblastoma. Single-center retrospective review of all unilateral retinoblastoma patients with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma treated at MSKCC between our introduction of OAC (May 2006) and December 2014. End points were ocular survival, patient survival from metastases and enucleation rates. 156 eyes of 156 retinoblastoma patients were included. Primary enucleation rates have progressively decreased from a rate of >95% before OAC to 66.7% in the first year of OAC use to the present rate of 7.4%. The percent of patients receiving OAC has progressively increased from 33.3% in 2006 to 92.6% in 2014. Overall, ocular survival was significantly better in eyes treated with OAC in the years 2010-2014 compared to 2006-2009 (p = 0.023, 92.7% vs 68.0% ocular survival at 48 months). There have been no metastatic deaths in the OAC group but two patients treated with primary enucleation have died of metastatic disease. OAC was introduced in 2006 and its impact on patient management is profound. Enucleation rates have decreased from over 95% to less than 10%. Our ocular survival rate has also significantly and progressively improved since May 2006. Despite treating more advanced eyes rather then enucleating them patient survival has not been compromised (there have been no metastatic deaths in the OAC group).

Chronic medical conditions in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: Results of the Retinoblastoma Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-01-11,"Limited data are available regarding long-term morbidity in adult survivors of retinoblastoma (Rb). The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult survivors of Rb diagnosed between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire adapted from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study surveys. Chronic conditions were classified using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Multivariate Poisson regression was used to compare survivors of Rb with 2377 non-Rb controls, consisting of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study sibling cohort and survivors with bilateral versus unilateral disease. Survivors of Rb (53.6% with bilateral disease) and non-Rb controls had a mean age of 43.3 years (standard deviation, 11 years) and 37.6 years (SD, 8.6 years), respectively, at the time of study enrollment. At a median follow-up of 42 years (range, 15-75 years), 86.6% of survivors of Rb had at least 1 condition and 71.1% had a severe/life-threatening (grade 3-4) condition. The adjusted relative risk (RR) of a chronic condition in survivors compared with non-Rb controls was 1.4 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.3-1.4; P<.01); for a grade 3 to 4 condition, the RR was 7.6 (95% CI, 6.4-8.9; P<.01). Survivors were at an excess risk regardless of laterality. After stratifying by laterality and excluding ocular conditions and second malignant neoplasms (SMNs), only those with bilateral disease were found to be at an increased risk of any nonocular, non-SMN condition (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2) and for grade 3 to 4 nonocular, non-SMN conditions (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5). Survivors of Rb have an increased risk of chronic conditions compared with non-Rb controls. After excluding ocular conditions and SMNs, this excess risk was found to persist only for those with bilateral disease.

Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (Ophthalmic Artery Chemosurgery) for Group D Retinoblastoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2016-01-12,"To report globe salvage rates, patient survival and adverse events of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) for International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) group D retinoblastoma (naive and after prior failures). Single institution retrospective review of all Group D eyes treated with OAC from 5/2006-12/2012. Patients were treated according to our previously-published techniques. Primary outcome was globe retention without need for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Demographics, prior treatments, OAC agents used, and adverse events were also recorded. 112 group D eyes (103 patients) that underwent OAC were included (average follow-up was 34 months, range: 2-110 months). 47 eyes were treatment-naïve, 58 eyes received prior treatments elsewhere, and 7 young infants (7 eyes) underwent our published ""bridge therapy"" (single agent intravenous carboplatin) until old enough to undergo OAC. Median number of OAC sessions/eye was 3 (range 1-9). 110/112 eyes received intra-arterial melphalan, but only 31 eyes received melphalan alone. 43 eyes received carboplatin, and 78 eyes received topotecan (never as a single agent). 80/112 eyes received >1 drug over their treatment course, and 39 eyes received all three agents. 24 eyes (16 pretreated, 7 treatment-naïve, 1 bridge) failed treatment and required enucleation during the study period. Enucleation and EBRT were avoided in 88/112 eyes (78.6%; including 40/47 [85.1%] treatment-naïve eyes, 42/58 [72.4%] previously-treated eyes, and 6/7 eyes [85.7%] among bridge patients). By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, globe salvage rate was 74% at 110 months among all patients, and 85% at 110 months in the treatment-naïve subgroup.

"Targeting the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-retinoblastoma pathway with selective CDK 4/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: rationale, current status, and future directions.",Discovery medicine,Discov Med,2016-01-01,"Dysregulation of the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-INK4-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway is an important contributor to endocrine therapy resistance. Recent clinical development of selective inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 kinases has led to renewed interest in cell cycle regulators, following experience with relatively non-selective pan-CDK inhibitors that often resulted in limited activity and poor safety profiles in the clinic. The highly selective oral CDK 4/6 inhibitors palbociclib (PD0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219) are able to inhibit the proliferation of Rb-positive tumor cells and have demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition in ER+ breast cancer models. In metastatic breast cancer, all three agents are being explored in combination with endocrine therapy in Phase III studies. Results so far indicated promising efficacy and manageable safety profiles, and led to the FDA approval of palbociclib. Phase II-III studies of these agents, in combination with endocrine therapy, are also underway in early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Selective CDK 4/6 inhibitors are also being investigated with other targeted agents or chemotherapy in the advanced setting. This article reviews the rationale for targeting cyclin D-CDK 4/6 in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, provides an overview of the available preclinical and clinical data with CDK 4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer to date, and summarizes the main features of ongoing clinical trials of these new agents in breast cancer. Future trials evaluating further combination strategies with CDK 4/6 backbone and translational studies refining predictive biomarkers are needed to help personalize the optimal treatment regimen for individual patients with ER+ breast cancer.

Glioblastoma.,Handbook of clinical neurology,Handb Clin Neurol,2016-01-01,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Defining histopathologic features are necrosis and endothelial proliferation, resulting in the assignment of grade IV, the highest grade in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumors. The classic clinical term ""secondary glioblastoma"" refers to a minority of glioblastomas that evolve from previously diagnosed WHO grade II or grade III gliomas. Specific point mutations of the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 appear to define molecularly these tumors that are associated with younger age and more favorable outcome; the vast majority of glioblastomas are IDH wild-type. Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/rat sarcoma (RAS)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) signaling. Standard treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy, and alkylating chemotherapy. Promoter methylation of the gene encoding the DNA repair protein, O(6)-methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), predicts benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide and guides choice of first-line treatment in elderly patients. Current developments focus on targeting the molecular characteristics that drive the malignant phenotype, including altered signal transduction and angiogenesis, and more recently, various approaches of immunotherapy.

Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibition for the Treatment of Unresectable Mature Teratoma: Long-Term Follow-Up of a Phase II Study.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2016-03-12,"Unresectable mature teratoma is an incurable disease associated with significant morbidity. Given the rarity of the disease, long-term outcomes for patients receiving systemic therapy have not been well described. The present study was a retrospective analysis with long-term follow-up data of the patient cohort with unresectable mature teratoma treated in the nonrandomized phase II study of palbociclib for the treatment of metastatic, retinoblastoma protein-expressing refractory germ cell tumors. Patient clinical data were obtained from the medical records and by communication with the enrolled patients and referring medical providers. Major medical events for the treatment of germ cell tumor, including before, during, and after study treatment, were recorded. The major clinical events of interest included the initiation of systemic therapy, radiation therapy, surgical debulking, or other invasive procedures. The study endpoints included the prestudy period and study period clinical event rates, event-free survival, and radiographic progression-free survival. Long-term follow-up data were obtained for 12 patients with unresectable mature teratoma. The median prestudy period follow-up period was 19.7 months, and the median study follow-up period was 38.0 months. The median number of palbociclib treatment cycles was 11. The prestudy major clinical event rate was 2.27 events annually (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66-3.13 events), and the study period event rate was 0.62 events annually (95% CI, 0.36-1.09 events). The median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% CI, 1.8-22.6 months), and the median event-free survival duration was 16.2 months (95% CI, 3.0-24.3 months).

Inhibition of DNA damage repair by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib delays irradiated intracranial atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor and glioblastoma xenograft regrowth.,Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2016-07-01,"Radiation therapy is the most commonly used postsurgical treatment for primary malignant brain tumors. Consequently, investigating the efficacy of chemotherapeutics combined with radiation for treating malignant brain tumors is of high clinical relevance. In this study, we examined the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, when used in combination with radiation for treating human atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) as well as glioblastoma (GBM). Evaluation of treatment antitumor activity in vitro was based upon results from cell proliferation assays, clonogenicity assays, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry for DNA double-strand break repair. Interpretation of treatment antitumor activity in vivo was based upon bioluminescence imaging, animal subject survival analysis, and staining of tumor sections for markers of proliferation and apoptosis. For each of the retinoblastoma protein (RB)-proficient tumor models examined (2 ATRTs and 2 GBMs), one or more of the combination therapy regimens significantly (P < .05) outperformed both monotherapies with respect to animal subject survival benefit. Among the combination therapy regimens, concurrent palbociclib and radiation treatment and palbociclib treatment following radiation consistently outperformed the sequence in which radiation followed palbociclib treatment. In vitro investigation revealed that the concurrent use of palbociclib with radiation, as well as palbociclib following radiation, inhibited DNA double-strand break repair and promoted increased tumor cell apoptosis.

EGFR and RB1 as Dual Biomarkers in HPV-Negative Head and Neck Cancer.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2016-08-09,"Clinical decision making for human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is predominantly guided by disease stage and anatomic location, with few validated biomarkers. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target, but its value in guiding therapeutic decision making remains ambiguous. We integrated analysis of clinically annotated tissue microarrays with analysis of data available through the TCGA, to investigate the idea that expression signatures involving EGFR, proteins regulating EGFR function, and core cell-cycle modulators might serve as prognostic or drug response-predictive biomarkers. This work suggests that consideration of the expression of NSDHL and proteins that regulate EGFR recycling in combination with EGFR provides a useful prognostic biomarker set. In addition, inactivation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), reflected by CCND1/CDK6-inactivating phosphorylation of RB1 at T356, inversely correlated with expression of EGFR in patient HNSCC samples. Moreover, stratification of cases with high EGFR by expression levels of CCND1, CDK6, or the CCND1/CDK6-regulatory protein p16 (CDKN2A) identified groups with significant survival differences. To further explore the relationship between EGFR and RB1-associated cell-cycle activity, we evaluated simultaneous inhibition of RB1 phosphorylation with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and of EGFR activity with lapatinib or afatinib. These drug combinations had synergistic inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HNSCC cells and strikingly limited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in contrast to either agent used alone. In summary, combinations of CDK and EGFR inhibitors may be particularly useful in EGFR and p<sup>T356</sup>RB1-expressing or CCND1/CDK6-overexpressing HPV-negative HNSCC.

Cancer Res.,2016-08-19,"Ribociclib (an oral, highly specific cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor) inhibits tumor growth in preclinical models with intact retinoblastoma protein (Rb<sup>+</sup>). This first-in-human study investigated the MTD, recommended dose for expansion (RDE), safety, preliminary activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ribociclib in patients with Rb<sup>+</sup> advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Patients received escalating doses of ribociclib (3-weeks-on/1-week-off or continuous). Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model with overdose control principle. Among 132 patients, 125 received ribociclib 3-weeks-on/1-week-off and 7 were dosed continuously. Nine dose-limiting toxicities were observed among 70 MTD/RDE evaluable patients during cycle 1, most commonly neutropenia (n = 3) and thrombocytopenia (n = 2). The MTD and RDE were established as 900 and 600 mg/day 3-weeks-on/1-week-off, respectively. Common treatment-related adverse events were (all-grade; grade 3/4) neutropenia (46%; 27%), leukopenia (43%; 17%), fatigue (45%; 2%), and nausea (42%; 2%). Asymptomatic Fridericia's corrected QT prolongation was specific to doses ≥600 mg/day (9% of patients at 600 mg/day; 33% at doses >600 mg/day). Plasma exposure increases were slightly higher than dose proportional; mean half-life at the RDE was 32.6 hours. Reduced Ki67 was observed in paired skin and tumor biopsies, consistent with ribociclib-mediated antiproliferative activity. There were 3 partial responses and 43 patients achieved a best response of stable disease; 8 patients were progression-free for >6 months. Ribociclib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, dose-dependent plasma exposure, and preliminary signs of clinical activity. Phase I-III studies of ribociclib are under way in various indications.

Role of CDKN2C Copy Number in Sporadic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma.,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,Thyroid,2016-10-18,"The cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitors (CDKN)/retinoblastoma (RB1) pathway has been implicated as having a role in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumorigenesis. CDKN2C loss has been associated with RET-mediated MTC in humans but with minimal phenotypic correlation provided. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between tumor RET mutation status, CDKN2C loss, and aggressiveness of MTC in a cohort of patients with sporadic disease. Tumors from patients with sporadic MTC treated at a single institution were evaluated for somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C copy number loss. These variables were compared to patient demographics, pathology detail, clinical course, and disease-specific and overall survival. Sixty-two MTC cases with an initial surgery date ranging from 1983 to 2009 met the inclusion criteria, of whom 36 (58%) were male. The median age at initial surgery was 53 years (range 22-81 years). The median tumor size was 30 mm (range 6-145 mm) with 29 (57%) possessing extrathyroidal extension. Nodal and/or distant metastasis at presentation was found in 47/60 (78%) and 12/61 (20%) patients, respectively. Median follow-up time was 10.5 years (range 1.1-27.8 years) for the censored observations. The presence of CDKN2C loss was associated with worse M stage and overall AJCC stage. Median overall survival of patients with versus without CDKN2C loss was 4.14 [confidence interval (CI) 1.93-NA] versus 18.27 [CI 17.24-NA] years (p < 0.0001). Median overall survival of patients with a combined somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C loss versus no somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C loss versus somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C 2N versus no somatic RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation and CDKN2C 2N was 2.38 [CI 1.67-NA] years versus 10.81 [CI 2.46-NA] versus 17.24 [CI 9.82-NA] versus not reached [CI 13.46-NA] years (p < 0.0001). The detection of somatic CDKN2C loss is associated with the presence of distant metastasis at presentation as well decreased overall survival, a relationship enhanced by concomitant RET<sup>M918T</sup> mutation. Further defining the genes involved in the progression of metastatic MTC will be an important step toward identifying pathways of disease progression and new therapeutic targets.",Journal Article,1190.0,11.0,cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitors CDKN /retinoblastoma RB1 pathway implicated role medullary thyroid carcinoma MTC tumorigenesis CDKN2C loss associated RET-mediated MTC humans minimal phenotypic correlation provided objective evaluate association RET status CDKN2C loss aggressiveness MTC cohort patients sporadic disease patients sporadic MTC treated single institution evaluated somatic RET sup M918T /sup CDKN2C copy number loss variables compared patient demographics pathology clinical course disease-specific overall survival Sixty-two MTC cases initial surgery date ranging 1983 2009 met inclusion criteria 36 58 male median age initial surgery 53 years range 22-81 years median size 30 mm range 6-145 mm 29 57 possessing extrathyroidal extension Nodal and/or distant metastasis presentation 47/60 78 12/61 20 patients respectively Median follow-up time 10.5 years range 1.1-27.8 years censored observations presence CDKN2C loss associated worse stage overall AJCC stage Median overall survival patients versus CDKN2C loss 4.14 confidence interval CI 1.93-NA versus 18.27 CI 17.24-NA years p 0.0001 Median overall survival patients combined somatic RET sup M918T /sup CDKN2C loss versus somatic RET sup M918T /sup CDKN2C loss versus somatic RET sup M918T /sup CDKN2C 2N versus somatic RET sup M918T /sup CDKN2C 2N 2.38 CI 1.67-NA years versus 10.81 CI 2.46-NA versus 17.24 CI 9.82-NA versus reached CI 13.46-NA years p 0.0001 detection somatic CDKN2C loss associated presence distant metastasis presentation decreased overall survival relationship enhanced concomitant RET sup M918T /sup defining involved progression metastatic MTC important step identifying pathways disease progression new therapeutic targets,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[3, 1226, 470, 216, 222, 68961, 18175, 4596, 308, 71, 85, 1771, 22, 1041, 8, 200, 4, 4564, 134, 3959, 1565, 17381, 407, 71, 85, 41, 5, 2412, 517, 3959, 4, 3218, 84, 5, 1048, 3290, 816, 1052, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 248, 59, 30, 2412, 258, 156, 17381, 407, 2, 3908, 1, 3959, 4, 8, 180, 1, 7, 5, 1928, 34, 57, 29, 7, 5, 1928, 3959, 73, 28, 8, 226, 731, 11, 194, 9, 1119, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 2, 17381, 1337, 207, 407, 46, 682, 11, 72, 6, 69, 2221, 1117, 5000, 38, 906, 2, 34, 112, 2, 63, 25, 1746, 100, 3959, 140, 5, 35, 388, 152, 1244, 2223, 29, 6656, 6, 1238, 543, 3, 1680, 371, 1, 953, 511, 717, 11, 1045, 3, 52, 89, 28, 388, 152, 10, 699, 60, 184, 350, 865, 60, 3, 52, 30, 444, 10, 201, 321, 184, 49, 4058, 321, 5, 462, 696, 11228, 18518, 2401, 779, 2, 15, 626, 278, 28, 1031, 10, 204, 4, 662, 335, 833, 2, 133, 713, 179, 7, 106, 52, 166, 126, 98, 10, 79, 33, 60, 184, 14, 14, 428, 66, 60, 9, 3, 7534, 2172, 3, 463, 1, 17381, 407, 10, 41, 5, 639, 188, 82, 2, 63, 2271, 82, 52, 63, 25, 1, 7, 5, 185, 187, 17381, 407, 10, 39, 213, 307, 268, 58, 14, 966, 5328, 185, 203, 428, 58, 269, 259, 5328, 60, 19, 13, 488, 52, 63, 25, 1, 7, 5, 8, 397, 1119, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 2, 17381, 407, 185, 77, 1119, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 2, 17381, 407, 185, 1119, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 2, 17381, 24955, 185, 77, 1119, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 2, 17381, 24955, 10, 18, 519, 58, 14, 598, 5328, 60, 185, 79, 865, 58, 18, 641, 5328, 185, 269, 259, 58, 83, 878, 5328, 185, 44, 1300, 58, 233, 641, 5328, 60, 19, 13, 488, 3, 638, 1, 1119, 17381, 407, 16, 41, 5, 3, 463, 1, 626, 278, 28, 1031, 22, 149, 340, 63, 25, 8, 858, 651, 20, 1781, 2412, 172, 14704, 172, 258, 195, 2847, 3, 214, 646, 4, 3, 91, 1, 113, 3959, 303, 40, 35, 305, 2458, 1317, 1386, 460, 1, 34, 91, 2, 217, 189, 637]",2224.0,27610696,Role CDKN2C Copy Number Sporadic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma,0,0.0
"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Ambiguous human papillomavirus status, elevated p16, and deleted retinoblastoma 1.",Head & neck,Head Neck,2016-11-08,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is potentially curable, but treatment planning remains a challenge. Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive disease is often associated with a good prognosis compared with HPV-negative disease. However, some HPV-positive HNSCC recurs, often with distant metastases and significant treatment resistance. We performed p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH) for high-risk HPV, and comprehensive genomic profiling on oropharyngeal HNSCC with basaloid features and particularly aggressive disease course, noting a rare genetic event: a deleting mutation (exons 5-17) of the tumor suppressor and dominant cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Genomic and transcriptomic data available through FoundationOne and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were reviewed for additional HNSCC cases with RB1 alterations.

Ocular Salvage and Vision Preservation Using a Topotecan-Based Regimen for Advanced Intraocular Retinoblastoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-31,"Purpose To evaluate topotecan-based therapy for advanced intraocular retinoblastoma. Patients and Methods Twenty-seven patients with bilateral retinoblastoma (male patients, n = 14; median age, 8.4 months) received chemotherapy: two courses of topotecan plus vincristine followed by three alternating administrations of carboplatin and vincristine for two courses and topotecan plus vincristine for one course, with optional periocular carboplatin. Focal therapy was applied after cycle 2. Event-free survival was defined as avoidance of external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and enucleation. Results Of 54 eyes, 42 were Reese-Ellsworth group IV to V, and 37 were International Classification of Retinoblastoma group C to E. Eleven eyes were enucleated: one at diagnosis, nine with progressive disease including three eyes treated with EBRT, and one that developed neovascular glaucoma after completion of therapy. One patient was removed from protocol with prolonged infection in course 1; 26 patients (51 eyes) were analyzed. At 10 years, cumulative incidence of EBRT was 5.9% (SE ± 3), and event-free survival was 69.2% (SE ± 27.2). Ocular survival for Reese-Ellsworth group IV to V eyes was 77.5% (SE ± 21.2); it was 74.3% (SE ≥ 18.8) for International Classification group C to E eyes. Vision testing (median age, 7 years; range, 5 to 10 years) documented 20/70 vision or better in one eye of 23 patients; 19 (76%) of 25 patients demonstrated 20/40 vision or better in one eye. All patients experienced thrombocytopenia (41 episodes in 275 courses; 15%). There were 29 episodes of febrile neutropenia (10%). Grade 3 diarrhea was present in nine of 27 patients, and one patient had an allergic reaction to carboplatin. All patients are alive at median follow-up 7.4 years (range, 2.7 to 10 years).

Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for eyes with advanced retinoblastoma.,Ophthalmic genetics,Ophthalmic Genet.,2017-01-17,"Surgical removal of one or both eyes has been the most common way to treat children with retinoblastoma worldwide for more than 100 years. Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) was introduced 10 years ago and it has been used as an alternative to enucleation for eyes with advanced retinoblastoma. The purpose of this report is to analyze our 9-year experience treating advanced retinoblastoma eyes with OAC. Single-arm retrospective study from a single center of 226 eyes with eyes of retinoblastoma patients with advanced intraocular disease defined as both Reese-Ellsworth (RE) ""Va"" or ""Vb"" and International Classification Retinoblastoma (ICRb) group ""D"" or ""E"" (COG Classification). Ocular survival, patient survival, second cancers, and electroretinography (ERG) were assessed. Ocular survival at five years for these advanced eyes was 70.2% (95% confidence interval, 57.3%-79.8%). When eyes were divided into groups either by RE classification or ICRb, no significant differences in ocular survival were seen. Ocular survival was significantly better in naïve compared to non-naïve eyes (80.2% vs 58.4%, p = 0.041). The ERG distribution was very similar before and after OAC treatment for the patient population that did not receive intravitreal chemotherapy. Three patients (1.5%) have developed metastatic retinoblastoma (previously reported) and were successfully treated (no deaths). Using OAC for advanced eyes (the majority of such eyes have been enucleated in the past) enables 70% 5-year ocular survival. Treated eyes have a similar ERG distribution before and after treatment.

Ribociclib (LEE011): Mechanism of Action and Clinical Impact of This Selective Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor in Various Solid Tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-03-28,"The cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-p16-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway is commonly disrupted in cancer, leading to abnormal cell proliferation. Therapeutics targeting this pathway have demonstrated antitumor effects in preclinical and clinical studies. Ribociclib is a selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, which received FDA approval in March 2017 and is set to enter the treatment landscape alongside other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and abemaciclib. Here, we describe the mechanism of action of ribociclib and review preclinical and clinical data from phase I, II, and III trials of ribociclib across different tumor types, within the context of other selective CDK4/6 inhibitors. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and clinical responses with ribociclib as a single agent or in combination with other therapies are discussed, and an overview of the broad portfolio of ongoing clinical trials with ribociclib across a wide range of indications is presented. On the basis of the available data, ribociclib has a manageable tolerability profile and therapeutic potential for a variety of cancer types. Its high selectivity makes it an important partner drug for other targeted therapies, and it has been shown to enhance the clinical activity of existing anticancer therapies and delay the development of treatment resistance, without markedly increasing toxicity. Ongoing trials of doublet and triplet targeted therapies containing ribociclib seek to identify optimal CDK4/6-based targeted combination regimens for various tumor types and advance the field of precision therapeutics in oncology. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3251-62. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1029.0,49.0,cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase CDK 4/6-p16-retinoblastoma Rb pathway commonly disrupted leading abnormal proliferation Therapeutics targeting pathway demonstrated antitumor effects preclinical clinical studies Ribociclib selective orally bioavailable inhibitor CDK4 CDK6 received FDA approval March 2017 set enter treatment landscape alongside CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib abemaciclib mechanism action ribociclib review preclinical clinical phase II III trials ribociclib different types context selective CDK4/6 inhibitors pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics safety tolerability clinical responses ribociclib single agent combination therapies discussed overview broad portfolio ongoing clinical trials ribociclib wide range indications presented basis available ribociclib manageable tolerability profile therapeutic potential variety types high selectivity makes important partner drug targeted therapies shown enhance clinical activity existing anticancer therapies delay development treatment resistance markedly increasing toxicity Ongoing trials doublet triplet targeted therapies containing ribociclib seek identify optimal CDK4/6-based targeted combination regimens types advance field precision therapeutics oncology Clin Res 23 13 3251-62 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1226, 427, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 39, 49, 1932, 18175, 2955, 308, 16, 841, 5576, 4, 12, 1049, 6, 1668, 31, 457, 1943, 529, 26, 308, 47, 264, 579, 176, 4, 693, 2, 38, 94, 7342, 16, 8, 1094, 1428, 6582, 230, 1, 3254, 2, 9518, 92, 103, 2078, 1814, 4, 2363, 1759, 2, 16, 916, 6, 7058, 3, 24, 2801, 10150, 127, 3254, 49, 222, 141, 4895, 2, 10140, 467, 21, 897, 3, 670, 1, 1578, 1, 7342, 2, 206, 693, 2, 38, 74, 29, 124, 70, 215, 2, 316, 143, 1, 7342, 716, 338, 30, 630, 262, 3, 1533, 1, 127, 1094, 3254, 49, 222, 3, 1159, 3587, 367, 1543, 2, 38, 253, 5, 7342, 22, 8, 226, 420, 15, 4, 150, 5, 127, 235, 32, 1588, 2, 35, 2901, 1, 3, 2094, 17779, 1, 942, 38, 143, 5, 7342, 716, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 2406, 16, 917, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 390, 74, 7342, 71, 8, 2808, 1543, 800, 2, 189, 174, 9, 8, 1362, 1, 12, 630, 211, 64, 6072, 4677, 192, 35, 305, 4852, 234, 9, 127, 238, 235, 2, 192, 71, 85, 443, 6, 1304, 3, 38, 128, 1, 1692, 1475, 235, 2, 1984, 3, 193, 1, 24, 251, 187, 2195, 602, 155, 942, 143, 1, 4872, 2, 7706, 238, 235, 1101, 7342, 6606, 6, 255, 665, 3254, 49, 90, 238, 150, 472, 9, 747, 30, 630, 2, 3148, 3, 1067, 1, 2720, 1943, 4, 413, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 233, 46423, 744, 3194, 1630, 70]",1685.0,28351928,Ribociclib LEE011 Mechanism Action Clinical Impact Selective Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor Solid,0,0.0
Plasmacytoid Urothelial Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder: A Clinicopathologic and Immunohistochemical Analysis of 49 Cases.,American journal of clinical pathology,Am. J. Clin. Pathol.,2017-05-01,"Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma (PUC) of the bladder is a rare histologic variant. We retrospectively analyzed a large series of bladder PUC from a single institution. The patients consisted of 44 men and five women with a mean age of 62 years (range, 45-86 years). PUC was pure in 23 cases and mixed with other histologic types in 26 cases. All PUCs diffusely invaded the bladder wall. Most PUCs lacked immunoreactivity for the retinoblastoma (RB) gene protein (12/32) and E-cadherin (8/30).

Cancer Res.,2017-04-21,"<b>Purpose:</b> The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib (LEE011), displayed preclinical activity in neuroblastoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) models. In this phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary activity of single-agent ribociclib were investigated in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, MRT, or other cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-retinoblastoma pathway-altered tumors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Patients (aged 1-21 years) received escalating once-daily oral doses of ribociclib (3-weeks-on/1-week-off). Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control and real-time PK.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-two patients (median age, 5.5 years) received ribociclib 280, 350, or 470 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Three patients had dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 fatigue (280 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>n</i> = 1) or grade 4 thrombocytopenia (470 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>n</i> = 2). Most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) were hematologic: neutropenia (72% all-grade/63% grade 3/4), leukopenia (63%/38%), anemia (44%/3%), thrombocytopenia (44%/28%), and lymphopenia (38%/19%), followed by vomiting (38%/0%), fatigue (25%/3%), nausea (25%/0%), and QTc prolongation (22%/0%). Ribociclib exposure was dose-dependent at 350 and 470 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [equivalent to 600 (RP2D)-900 mg in adults], with high interpatient variability. Best overall response was stable disease (SD) in nine patients (seven with neuroblastoma, two with primary CNS MRT); five patients achieved SD for more than 6, 6, 8, 12, and 13 cycles, respectively.<b>Conclusions:</b> Ribociclib demonstrated acceptable safety and PK in pediatric patients. MTD (470 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and RP2D (350 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were equivalent to those in adults.

"The Dynamic Epigenetic Landscape of the Retina During Development, Reprogramming, and Tumorigenesis.",Neuron,Neuron,2017-05-01,"In the developing retina, multipotent neural progenitors undergo unidirectional differentiation in a precise spatiotemporal order. Here we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified retina-specific epigenetic memory.",Journal Article,995.0,46.0,developing retina multipotent neural progenitors undergo unidirectional differentiation precise spatiotemporal order profile epigenetic transcriptional changes occur retinogenesis mice humans progenitor cycle epigenetically silenced retinogenesis dramatic change derepression cell-type-specific differentiation programs identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers showed epigenetic changes conserved humans mice determine epigenome changes tumorigenesis reprogramming performed integrated epigenetic murine human retinoblastomas induced pluripotent stem iPSCs derived murine rod photoreceptors retinoblastoma epigenome mapped developmental stage retinal progenitors switch neurogenic terminal patterns division epigenome retinoblastomas similar normal retina retina-derived iPSCs identified retina-specific epigenetic memory,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 931, 17289, 16392, 3922, 4321, 1251, 16955, 910, 4, 8, 3260, 26231, 1732, 467, 21, 800, 3, 1418, 2, 1431, 400, 17, 1271, 190, 50357, 4, 399, 2, 3218, 242, 476, 2520, 214, 2, 31, 417, 214, 11, 8976, 5442, 190, 50357, 3, 96, 3079, 707, 10, 15554, 1, 31, 267, 112, 910, 2251, 21, 108, 4566, 82, 112, 10582, 9139, 2, 224, 17, 96, 1418, 400, 32, 5547, 4, 3218, 2, 399, 6, 223, 832, 3, 10206, 400, 190, 1565, 2, 7394, 21, 173, 2102, 1418, 65, 1, 1471, 2, 171, 18431, 2, 277, 13007, 452, 37, 25791, 526, 29, 1471, 14202, 50358, 3, 10206, 6224, 6, 3, 4566, 82, 198, 6831, 4321, 5096, 29, 16731, 6, 2158, 764, 1, 31, 5750, 3, 10206, 1, 18431, 10, 80, 288, 6, 17, 1, 3, 295, 17289, 76, 17, 1, 17289, 526, 25791, 2, 21, 108, 17289, 112, 1418, 2407]",1098.0,28472656,Dynamic Epigenetic Landscape Retina Development Reprogramming Tumorigenesis,0,0.0
Vitreous Seeds in Retinoblastoma: Clinicopathologic Classification and Correlation.,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,2017-05-17,"A recent classification scheme for retinoblastoma vitreous seeds has shown promise in predicting treatment response. For the first time, we correlate this clinical classification scheme with its histopathologic features. Retrospective review. Enucleated eyes received at the pathology department of the Retinoblastoma Center of Houston from 2010 to 2015. Macroscopic photographs of the enucleated eyes of patients with retinoblastoma were analyzed to select those with vitreous seeds. Cases with adequate material for clinicopathologic correlation were selected for further analysis, and clinical photographs were reviewed. Routine histopathologic slides were reviewed and compared with the clinical and macroscopic photographs. Seeds were classified as type 1 (""dust""), type 2 (""sphere""), or type 3 (""cloud""). To confirm the presence of macrophages, CD68 immunohistochemical staining was used. Synaptophysin was used to stain retinoblastoma cells. To correlate clinical vitreous seed type with histopathologic features. A total of 14 eyes with adequate amounts of tumor seeds along with clinical and macroscopic photographic correlation were selected from a total of 138 eyes reviewed. Type 1 seeds consisted of individual viable tumor cells and scattered macrophages. Type 2 seeds consisted of 2 submorphologies: spheres with viable cells throughout and spheres with an outer rim of viable cells but necrotic cells centrally. Type 3 seeds were composed of more than 90% necrotic material admixed with few macrophages and viable cells at their outer rim. Untreated (8/14) and previously treated (6/14) eyes showed similar histopathologic features for each type of seeds. Treated eyes had more type 1 and 3 seeds. We provide the first histopathologic correlation of the clinical classification scheme for vitreous seeds in retinoblastoma. ""Dust"" is formed by scattered single cells alternating with macrophages. ""Spheres"" with translucent centers contain multiple layers of viable tumor cells that shed single cells and may be more clinically aggressive. ""Cloud"" seeds are mostly composed of necrotic material, explaining their lack of therapeutic response. Pretreated eyes showed tumor seeds morphologically similar to untreated eyes.

Second primary malignancies in retinoblastoma patients treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy: the first 10 years.,The British journal of ophthalmology,Br J Ophthalmol,2017-06-09,"Survivors of retinoblastoma carry a lifetime risk of secondary malignancies. It is well established that external beam radiation increases this risk; however, the risk with ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) remains unknown. We report on 10 years of experience with OAC and the rate of second primary malignancy (SPM) development. This is a single-centre retrospective review approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board of all patients who received OAC over a 10-year period, from May 2006 to November 2016. The second tumour incidence and survival in patients with germline disease (bilateral and unilateral with family history or confirmed germline mutation) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who received external beam radiotherapy were excluded from analyses. Two hundred and thirty-three patients with heritable retinoblastoma who received OAC were analysed. Nineteen patients were excluded for having received external beam radiation. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the likelihood for SPM development was 2.7% at 5 years (95% CI 0 to 25).

Retinoblastoma and Neuroblastoma Predisposition and Surveillance.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-07-01,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood. Approximately 40% of retinoblastomas are hereditary and due to germline mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene. Children with hereditary RB are also at risk for developing a midline intracranial tumor, most commonly pineoblastoma. We recommend intensive ocular screening for patients with germline <i>RB1</i> mutations for retinoblastoma as well as neuroimaging for pineoblastoma surveillance. There is an approximately 20% risk of developing second primary cancers among individuals with hereditary RB, higher among those who received radiotherapy for their primary RB tumors. However, there is not yet a clear consensus on what, if any, screening protocol would be most appropriate and effective. Neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Prior studies suggest that about 2% of patients with NB have an underlying genetic predisposition that may have contributed to the development of NB. Germline mutations in <i>ALK</i> and <i>PHOX2B</i> account for most familial NB cases. However, other cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, RASopathies, and others, may be associated with an increased risk for NB. No established protocols for NB surveillance currently exist. Here, we describe consensus recommendations on hereditary RB and NB from the AACR Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); e98-e106. ©2017 AACR</i><b>See all articles in the online-only <i>CCR</i> Pediatric Oncology Series</b>.",Journal Article,934.0,35.0,Retinoblastoma RB common intraocular malignancy childhood Approximately 40 retinoblastomas hereditary germline RB1 /i Children hereditary RB risk developing midline intracranial commonly pineoblastoma recommend intensive ocular screening patients germline RB1 /i retinoblastoma neuroimaging pineoblastoma surveillance approximately 20 risk developing second primary individuals hereditary RB higher received radiotherapy primary RB clear consensus screening protocol appropriate effective Neuroblastoma NB embryonal sympathetic nervous accounts 15 pediatric deaths Prior studies suggest 2 patients NB underlying genetic predisposition contributed development NB Germline ALK /i PHOX2B /i account familial NB cases predisposition syndromes Li-Fraumeni syndrome RASopathies associated increased risk NB established protocols NB surveillance currently exist consensus recommendations hereditary RB NB AACR Childhood Predisposition Workshop Clin Res 23 13 e98-e106 ©2017 AACR /i b articles online-only CCR /i Pediatric Oncology Series /b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2955, 16, 3, 96, 186, 8600, 710, 4, 864, 705, 327, 1, 18431, 32, 2305, 2, 520, 6, 1009, 138, 4, 3, 70, 4596, 70, 145, 541, 5, 2305, 2955, 32, 120, 28, 43, 9, 931, 8, 8677, 2089, 30, 96, 841, 14221, 21, 2237, 1686, 4345, 453, 9, 7, 5, 1009, 70, 4596, 70, 138, 9, 22, 149, 22, 7468, 9, 14221, 617, 125, 16, 35, 705, 179, 43, 1, 931, 419, 86, 163, 107, 869, 5, 2305, 2955, 142, 107, 135, 54, 103, 310, 9, 136, 86, 2955, 57, 137, 125, 16, 44, 1145, 8, 885, 1391, 23, 2067, 492, 500, 453, 1182, 688, 40, 96, 870, 2, 323, 3446, 35, 5239, 30, 1, 3, 11277, 1880, 398, 4162, 9, 167, 1, 815, 12, 1043, 324, 94, 309, 17, 545, 18, 1, 7, 5, 3446, 47, 35, 1181, 336, 2863, 17, 68, 47, 3447, 6, 3, 193, 1, 3446, 1009, 138, 4, 70, 1023, 70, 2, 70, 26759, 70, 1967, 9, 96, 2200, 3446, 140, 137, 127, 12, 2863, 2040, 225, 22, 5066, 9130, 681, 48878, 2, 1749, 68, 40, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 9, 3446, 77, 635, 2189, 9, 3446, 617, 694, 1923, 467, 21, 897, 1391, 883, 23, 2305, 2955, 2, 3446, 29, 3, 1630, 864, 12, 2863, 4014, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 233, 70748, 70749, 3194, 1630, 70, 132, 3764, 62, 2384, 4, 3, 4123, 158, 70, 4992, 70, 815, 413, 988, 132]",1500.0,28674118,Retinoblastoma Neuroblastoma Predisposition Surveillance,7,0.03608247422680412
CDK4/6 inhibition triggers anti-tumour immunity.,Nature,Nature,2017-08-16,"Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer. The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements, thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as anti-cancer treatment.",Journal Article,888.0,206.0,Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 6 CDK4/6 fundamental drivers cycle required initiation progression malignancies Pharmacological inhibitors CDK4/6 shown significant activity solid tumours primary mechanism action thought inhibition phosphorylation retinoblastoma tumour suppressor inducing G1 cycle arrest tumour use mouse models breast carcinoma solid tumours selective CDK4/6 inhibitors induce tumour cycle arrest promote anti-tumour immunity confirm phenomenon transcriptomic serial biopsies clinical trial CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment breast enhanced anti-tumour immune response underpinnings CDK4/6 inhibitors activate tumour expression endogenous retroviral elements increasing intracellular levels double-stranded RNA turn stimulates production type III interferons enhances tumour antigen presentation Second CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress proliferation regulatory Mechanistically effects CDK4/6 inhibitors tumour regulatory associated reduced activity E2F target DNA methyltransferase 1 Ultimately events promote cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance tumour enhanced addition immune checkpoint blockade findings indicate CDK4/6 inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity provide rationale new combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors immunotherapies anti-cancer treatment,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1226, 470, 1549, 39, 2, 49, 3254, 49, 32, 4595, 3391, 1, 3, 31, 417, 2, 32, 616, 9, 3, 1118, 2, 91, 1, 747, 441, 3419, 222, 1, 3254, 49, 47, 443, 93, 128, 480, 392, 537, 1319, 136, 86, 670, 1, 1578, 16, 2739, 6, 40, 3, 297, 1, 982, 1, 3, 770, 1245, 1958, 3344, 31, 417, 1854, 4, 770, 37, 467, 21, 119, 830, 274, 1, 134, 2, 127, 537, 1319, 6, 514, 17, 1094, 3254, 49, 222, 44, 158, 1290, 770, 31, 417, 1854, 84, 120, 1617, 312, 770, 1604, 21, 1843, 26, 3936, 298, 5983, 65, 1, 2108, 1154, 29, 8, 38, 160, 1, 3254, 49, 230, 24, 9, 12, 3, 651, 312, 770, 250, 51, 71, 100, 8807, 157, 3254, 49, 222, 2977, 770, 31, 55, 1, 2682, 8658, 2531, 631, 602, 2087, 148, 1, 1627, 9021, 893, 26, 4, 3854, 6200, 1529, 1, 267, 316, 18369, 2, 3665, 2519, 770, 448, 1031, 419, 3254, 49, 222, 2195, 3134, 3, 457, 1, 1253, 102, 37, 4187, 3, 176, 1, 3254, 49, 222, 110, 23, 770, 37, 2, 23, 1253, 102, 37, 32, 41, 5, 405, 128, 1, 3, 5391, 283, 261, 3747, 14, 2050, 46, 281, 1617, 759, 102, 31, 517, 1960, 1, 770, 37, 92, 16, 195, 651, 20, 3, 352, 1, 250, 986, 1189, 114, 272, 1008, 17, 3254, 49, 222, 344, 770, 4050, 2, 377, 8, 1728, 9, 217, 150, 472, 3538, 3254, 49, 222, 2, 2811, 22, 312, 12, 24]",1671.0,28813415,CDK4/6 inhibition triggers anti-tumour immunity,0,0.0

The Effect of Ophthalmic Artery Chemosurgery on Immune Function in Retinoblastoma Patients: A Single Institution Retrospective Analysis.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2017-10-01,"Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) is associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, however the effect on T-cell number and function is unknown. The purpose of this retrospective review was to confirm that patients treated with OAC do not develop immunosuppression warranting Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. IRB approval was obtained for a single center retrospective review of immune function tests in retinoblastoma patients who received OAC. Twenty-three patients received ≥3 cycles of OAC and had immune function testing (absolute CD4 count) performed at a median of 34 days postcompletion of therapy (range, 15 to 63 d).

We evaluated expression of key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation in a large cohort of NETs. We evaluated immunohistochemical expression of CDKN1B, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (phospho-RB1) in a cohort of 267 patients with NETs. We then explored associations between cell cycle protein expression, mutational status, histologic features, and overall survival. We found that high expression of CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, and phospho-RB1 was associated with higher proliferative index, as defined by MKI67. We additionally observed a trend toward shorter overall survival associated with low expression of CDKN1B. This association seemed strongest in SINETs (multivariate hazards ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-3.93; P = 0.03). We found no clear association between CDKN1B mutation and protein expression.

miR-449a: a potential therapeutic agent for cancer.,Anti-cancer drugs,Anticancer Drugs,2017-11-01,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be associated with cancer progression and carcinogenesis. They are small, highly conserved, noncoding RNA molecules consisting of 19-25 nucleotides. By binding to complementary binding sites within the 3'-untranslated region of target mRNAs, miRNAs inhibit the translation of mRNAs or promote their degradation. miRNAs play critical roles in cancer initiation and development by functioning either as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors. Similarly, several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in regulating various biological processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, cellular differentiation, signal transduction, and carcinogenesis. Among miRNAs, one that may be of particular interest in cancer biology is miR-449a, which has been reported to inhibit tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, and to promote apoptosis and differentiation through the transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1, NOTCH, nuclear factor-κB/P65/vascular endothelial growth factor, retinoblastoma-E2F, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, WNT-β-catenin signaling, tumor protein P53, and androgen receptor signaling pathways. The miR-449 cluster is located in the second intron of CDC20B on chromosome 5q11.2, a region that has been identified as a susceptibility locus in cancer, and the abnormal expression of miR-449a may be related to the occurrence and development of tumors. As one example, miR-449a has been reported to be involved in the development of carcinoma and may be a potential prognostic indicator. On the basis of the putative pathogenetic relationships between cancer and miR-449a, we consider that miR-449a has the potential to serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of some types of cancer. In this review, the role of miR-449a in tumorigenesis and its mechanism of action are explored.

Differential impact of RB status on E2F1 reprogramming in human cancer.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2017-12-04,"The tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (RB) is mechanistically linked to suppression of transcription factor E2F1-mediated cell cycle regulation. For multiple tumor types, loss of RB function is associated with poor clinical outcome. RB action is abrogated either by direct depletion or through inactivation of RB function; however, the basis for this selectivity is unknown. Here, analysis of tumor samples and cell-free DNA from patients with advanced prostate cancer showed that direct RB loss was the preferred pathway of disruption in human disease. While RB loss was associated with lethal disease, RB-deficient tumors had no proliferative advantage and exhibited downstream effects distinct from cell cycle control. Mechanistically, RB loss led to E2F1 cistrome expansion and different binding specificity, alterations distinct from those observed after functional RB inactivation. Additionally, identification of protumorigenic transcriptional networks specific to RB loss that were validated in clinical samples demonstrated the ability of RB loss to differentially reprogram E2F1 in human cancers. Together, these findings not only identify tumor-suppressive functions of RB that are distinct from cell cycle control, but also demonstrate that the molecular consequence of RB loss is distinct from RB inactivation.

Therapeutic Challenge with a CDK 4/6 Inhibitor Induces an RB-Dependent SMAC-Mediated Apoptotic Response in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-01-08,"<b>Purpose:</b> The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB), a key regulator of cell-cycle progression and proliferation, is functionally suppressed in up to 50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RB function is exquisitely controlled by a series of proteins, including the CyclinD-CDK4/6 complex. In this study, we interrogated the capacity of a CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, to activate RB function.<b>Experimental Design and Results:</b> We employed multiple isogenic RB-proficient and -deficient NSCLC lines to interrogate the cytostatic and cytotoxic capacity of CDK 4/6 inhibition <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> We demonstrate that while short-term exposure to palbociclib induces cellular senescence, prolonged exposure results in inhibition of tumor growth. Mechanistically, CDK 4/6 inhibition induces a proapoptotic transcriptional program through suppression of IAPs FOXM1 and Survivin, while simultaneously augmenting expression of SMAC and caspase-3 in an RB-dependent manner.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study uncovers a novel function of RB activation to induce cellular apoptosis through therapeutic administration of a palbociclib and provides a rationale for the clinical evaluation of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with NSCLC. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1402-14. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,743.0,8.0,b Purpose /b retinoblastoma suppressor RB key regulator cell-cycle progression proliferation functionally suppressed 50 non-small lung NSCLC RB function exquisitely controlled series including CyclinD-CDK4/6 complex interrogated capacity CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib activate RB function. b Experimental Design /b employed multiple isogenic RB-proficient -deficient NSCLC lines interrogate cytostatic cytotoxic capacity CDK 4/6 inhibition vitro /i vivo /i demonstrate short-term exposure palbociclib induces cellular senescence prolonged exposure inhibition growth Mechanistically CDK 4/6 inhibition induces proapoptotic transcriptional program suppression IAPs FOXM1 Survivin simultaneously augmenting expression SMAC caspase-3 RB-dependent manner. b Conclusions /b uncovers novel function RB activation induce cellular apoptosis therapeutic administration palbociclib provides rationale clinical evaluation CDK 4/6 inhibitors treatment patients NSCLC Clin Res 24 6 1402-14 ©2018 AACR /i,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 3, 30, 1245, 2955, 8, 825, 2452, 1, 31, 417, 91, 2, 457, 16, 3772, 1908, 4, 126, 6, 212, 1, 31, 12, 304, 2955, 343, 16, 11936, 1149, 20, 8, 988, 1, 652, 141, 3, 33770, 3254, 49, 840, 4, 26, 45, 21, 7227, 3, 2162, 1, 8, 3254, 49, 230, 4895, 6, 2977, 2955, 343, 132, 1560, 771, 2, 99, 132, 21, 2516, 232, 7208, 2955, 5550, 2, 1971, 304, 285, 6, 8415, 3, 8154, 2, 759, 2162, 1, 3954, 39, 49, 297, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 70, 4, 386, 70, 21, 608, 17, 369, 978, 337, 645, 6, 4895, 1516, 763, 4672, 1069, 645, 99, 4, 297, 1, 30, 129, 4187, 3954, 39, 49, 297, 1516, 8, 4118, 1431, 1243, 298, 1332, 1, 19245, 7899, 2, 3160, 369, 3074, 9015, 55, 1, 9251, 2, 1469, 27, 4, 35, 2955, 470, 1708, 132, 2130, 132, 26, 45, 18562, 8, 229, 343, 1, 2955, 363, 6, 1290, 763, 351, 298, 189, 634, 1, 8, 4895, 2, 777, 8, 1728, 9, 3, 38, 451, 1, 3954, 39, 49, 222, 4, 3, 24, 1, 7, 5, 304, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 49, 46117, 213, 4281, 1630, 70]",1250.0,29311118,Therapeutic Challenge CDK 4/6 Inhibitor Induces RB-Dependent SMAC-Mediated Apoptotic Response Non-Small Lung,3,0.015463917525773196

Case records of children with newly diagnosed extraocular RB from January 2013 to August 2016 treated at our unit were analysed for clinical profile, treatment, and outcome. Over the 44 month study period, 91 children were diagnosed with RB, out of which 41 had extraocular disease. While 26 children had extraocular spread limited to orbit (IRSS stage III), 15 had a distant spread to brain (IRSS stage IV). Median lag period for diagnosis was eight months. Treatment abandonment rates were 38.5% and 46.6% in International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) stage III and IV respectively. With a median follow up of 31.5 months, the projected overall survival for IRSS III at one, two, and three years was 87.5%, 55.6%, and 39.7%. All patients with stage IV disease died after a median follow up duration of three months.

"Final results of a phase 2, open-label study of indisulam, idarubicin, and cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.",Cancer,Cancer,2018-04-16,"Indisulam possesses anticancer properties through down-regulation of various cell-cycle checkpoint molecules, thereby blocking the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and inducing p53 and p21. Indisulam exhibits synergy with nucleoside analogs and topoisomerase inhibitors. The authors designed a phase 2 study of indisulam in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients who had relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. In stage 1, patients received intravenous indisulam at 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle. If they had no response, then patients received same dose schedule of indisulam followed by intravenous idarubicin 8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily for 3 days and cytarabine 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> over 24 hours daily on days 9 through 12 (for those aged < 60 years) or days 9 through 11 (for those aged > 60 years) of a 28-day cycle. Primary endpoints included the overall response rate, and secondary objectives included overall survival. Forty patients were enrolled. Of the 37 evaluable patients, 31 received indisulam with chemotherapy. Of these, 11 (35%) responded for a median duration of 5.3 months. The estimated 1-year overall survival rate was 51% for responders compared with 8 % for nonresponders (P < .001). The most common grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicities were electrolyte abnormalities (50%) and febrile neutropenia (28%). The combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine yielded a 35% response rate in heavily pretreated patients with AML. With emerging data identifying the expression of DCAF15 (DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 15) as a potential biomarker for activity, the combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine should be studied in a biomarker-driven trial or in patients who have splicing factor mutations.

Total retinal detachments due to retinoblastoma: Outcomes following intra-arterial chemotherapy/ophthalmic artery chemosurgery.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2018-04-26,"To report on the rate and timing of retinal reattachment and outcomes for retinoblastoma children who have total retinal detachments at presentation to our center and were treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy (ophthalmic artery chemosurgery, OAC). Single-center retrospective review of retinoblastoma patients who presented with total retinal detachments and were subsequently treated with OAC at MSKCC between May 2006 and July 2016. Endpoints were retinal detachment resolution, visual function, ERG amplitude, ocular survival, and patient survival from metastases. 87 eyes of 84 retinoblastoma patients were included. Using a survival multistate model, by 36 months of follow-up, there was a 54% cumulative probability of complete retinal reattachment and a 76% probability of partial reattachment. 24% of eyes that completely reattached received only OAC without any prior or adjuvant treatments. Eyes that completely reattached were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed at a younger age (p<0.0001) and to have greater initial ERG values (p = 0.006).

Limited data are available regarding long-term vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult retinoblastoma survivors. To examine vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire for overall and specific scale scores among adult survivors of retinoblastoma. The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult retinoblastoma survivors treated at 3 academic medical centers in New York between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire between April 2008 and June 2010. Items were scored in January 2013 and preliminary analyses were performed in July 2015. Models were finalized in May 2017. Self-reported vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire. Items are scored from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life.

The overall mean (SD) VFQ composite score for all survivors was 81.1 (17.2) (mean [SD] score for unilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 91.4 [7.7]; bilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 72.3 [18.2]; difference between survivors with unilateral and bilateral disease, 19.1 [95% CI, 16.5-21.7; P < .001]). Prior exposure to radiotherapy was not associated with decreased overall VFQ (β = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.002; P = .06) but was related to a few specific subdomains of visual functioning.

The My Child Matters programme: effect of public-private partnerships on paediatric cancer care in low-income and middle-income countries.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-05-01,"In low-income and middle-income countries, an excess in treatment failure for children with cancer usually results from misdiagnosis, inadequate access to treatment, death from toxicity, treatment abandonment, and relapse. The My Child Matters programme of the Sanofi Espoir Foundation has funded 55 paediatric cancer projects in low-income and middle-income countries over 10 years. We assessed the impact of the projects in these regions by using baseline assessments that were done in 2006. Based on these data, estimated 5-year survival in 2016 increased by a median of 5·1%, ranging from -1·5% in Venezuela to 17·5% in Ukraine. Of the 26 861 children per year who develop cancer in the ten index countries with My Child Matters projects that were evaluated in 2006, an estimated additional 1343 children can now expect an increase in survival outcome. For example, in Paraguay, a network of paediatric oncology satellite clinics was established and scaled up to a national level and has managed 884 patients since initiation in 2006. Additionally, the African Retinoblastoma Network was scaled up from a demonstration project in Mali to a network of retinoblastoma referral centres in five sub-Saharan African countries, and the African School of Paediatric Oncology has trained 42 physicians and 100 nurses from 16 countries. The My Child Matters programme has catalysed improvements in cancer care and has complemented the efforts of government, civil society, and the private sector to sustain and scale improvements in health care to a national level. Key elements of successful interventions include strong and sustained local leadership, community engagement, international engagement, and capacity building and support from government.",Journal Article,630.0,11.0,low-income middle-income countries excess treatment failure children usually misdiagnosis inadequate access treatment death toxicity treatment abandonment relapse Child Matters programme Sanofi Espoir Foundation funded 55 paediatric projects low-income middle-income countries 10 years assessed impact projects regions baseline assessments 2006 Based estimated 5-year survival 2016 increased median 5·1 ranging -1·5 Venezuela 17·5 Ukraine 26 861 children year develop index countries Child Matters projects evaluated 2006 estimated additional 1343 children expect increase survival outcome example Paraguay network paediatric oncology satellite clinics established scaled national level managed 884 patients initiation 2006 Additionally African Retinoblastoma Network scaled demonstration project Mali network retinoblastoma referral centres sub-Saharan African countries African School Paediatric Oncology trained 42 physicians 100 nurses 16 countries Child Matters programme catalysed improvements care complemented efforts government civil society private sector sustain scale improvements health care national level Key elements successful interventions include strong sustained local leadership community engagement international engagement capacity building support government,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 154, 2306, 2, 3897, 2306, 2115, 35, 2612, 4, 24, 496, 9, 541, 5, 12, 2082, 99, 29, 13470, 3358, 1655, 6, 24, 273, 29, 155, 24, 9839, 2, 429, 3, 11569, 2566, 25029, 11410, 1, 3, 18364, 72692, 3247, 71, 3827, 614, 6138, 12, 9663, 4, 154, 2306, 2, 3897, 2306, 2115, 252, 79, 60, 21, 275, 3, 345, 1, 3, 9663, 4, 46, 1374, 20, 75, 330, 2182, 17, 11, 1822, 4, 1324, 90, 23, 46, 74, 661, 33, 111, 25, 4, 1390, 101, 20, 8, 52, 1, 22748, 2223, 29, 18648, 4, 45539, 6, 31909, 4, 43739, 1, 3, 432, 13668, 541, 379, 111, 54, 690, 12, 4, 3, 1618, 558, 2115, 5, 11569, 2566, 25029, 9663, 17, 11, 194, 4, 1324, 35, 661, 402, 50360, 541, 122, 1134, 8439, 35, 344, 4, 25, 228, 9, 2685, 4, 72693, 8, 1801, 1, 6138, 413, 10193, 4736, 10, 635, 2, 20469, 126, 6, 8, 657, 301, 2, 71, 2231, 14511, 7, 1192, 1118, 4, 1324, 1724, 3, 1410, 1801, 10, 20469, 126, 29, 8, 6533, 3105, 4, 72694, 6, 8, 1801, 1, 2096, 4496, 4, 365, 551, 17196, 1410, 2115, 2, 3, 1410, 5953, 1, 6138, 413, 71, 5946, 595, 1261, 2, 394, 2707, 29, 245, 2115, 3, 11569, 2566, 25029, 11410, 71, 47611, 1474, 4, 12, 165, 2, 71, 13275, 3, 1413, 1, 7608, 72695, 1174, 2, 3, 4745, 14210, 6, 8844, 2, 1124, 1474, 4, 341, 165, 6, 8, 657, 301, 825, 2531, 1, 1401, 1151, 643, 1082, 2, 2275, 293, 10001, 1714, 5103, 944, 5103, 2, 2162, 5808, 2, 538, 29, 7608]",1688.0,29726390,Child Matters programme effect public-private partnerships paediatric care low-income middle-income countries,0,0.0
MAPK Reliance via Acquired CDK4/6 Inhibitor Resistance in Cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-05-08,"<b>Purpose:</b> Loss of cell-cycle control is a hallmark of cancer, which can be targeted with agents, including cyclin-dependent kinase-4/6 (CDK4/6) kinase inhibitors that impinge upon the G<sub>1</sub>-S cell-cycle checkpoint via maintaining activity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB). This class of drugs is under clinical investigation for various solid tumor types and has recently been FDA-approved for treatment of breast cancer. However, development of therapeutic resistance is not uncommon.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In this study, palbociclib (a CDK4/6 inhibitor) resistance was established in models of early stage, RB-positive cancer.<b>Results:</b> This study demonstrates that acquired palbociclib resistance renders cancer cells broadly resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Acquired resistance was associated with aggressive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> phenotypes, including proliferation, migration, and invasion. Integration of RNA sequencing analysis and phosphoproteomics profiling revealed rewiring of the kinome, with a strong enrichment for enhanced MAPK signaling across all resistance models, which resulted in aggressive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> phenotypes and prometastatic signaling. However, CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant models were sensitized to MEK inhibitors, revealing reliance on active MAPK signaling to promote tumor cell growth and invasion.<b>Conclusions:</b> In sum, these studies identify MAPK reliance in acquired CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance that promotes aggressive disease, while nominating MEK inhibition as putative novel therapeutic strategy to treat or prevent CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance in cancer. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(17); 4201-14. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,623.0,8.0,b Purpose /b Loss cell-cycle control hallmark targeted agents including cyclin-dependent kinase-4/6 CDK4/6 kinase inhibitors impinge G sub 1 /sub -S cell-cycle checkpoint maintaining activity retinoblastoma suppressor RB class drugs clinical investigation solid types recently FDA-approved treatment breast development therapeutic resistance uncommon. b Experimental Design /b palbociclib CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance established models early stage RB-positive cancer. b /b demonstrates acquired palbociclib resistance renders broadly resistant CDK4/6 inhibitors Acquired resistance associated aggressive vitro /i vivo /i phenotypes including proliferation migration invasion Integration RNA sequencing phosphoproteomics profiling revealed rewiring kinome strong enrichment enhanced MAPK signaling resistance models resulted aggressive vitro /i vivo /i phenotypes prometastatic signaling CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant models sensitized MEK inhibitors revealing reliance active MAPK signaling promote growth invasion. b Conclusions /b sum studies identify MAPK reliance acquired CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance promotes aggressive disease nominating MEK inhibition putative novel therapeutic strategy treat prevent CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance Clin Res 24 17 4201-14 ©2018 AACR /i,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 407, 1, 31, 417, 182, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 12, 92, 122, 40, 238, 5, 183, 141, 1226, 470, 216, 39, 49, 3254, 49, 216, 222, 17, 31352, 1548, 3, 499, 551, 14, 551, 695, 31, 417, 986, 847, 3284, 128, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 2955, 26, 1040, 1, 600, 16, 669, 38, 940, 9, 747, 537, 30, 630, 2, 71, 761, 85, 2078, 850, 9, 24, 1, 12, 137, 193, 1, 189, 251, 16, 44, 2052, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 4, 26, 45, 4895, 8, 3254, 49, 230, 251, 10, 635, 4, 274, 1, 191, 82, 2955, 109, 12, 132, 99, 132, 26, 45, 1902, 17, 1294, 4895, 251, 8080, 12, 37, 5482, 436, 6, 3254, 49, 222, 1294, 251, 10, 41, 5, 571, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 70, 4, 386, 70, 2618, 141, 457, 1381, 2, 578, 2676, 1, 893, 615, 65, 2, 39666, 1080, 553, 21741, 1, 3, 14328, 5, 8, 1082, 3020, 9, 651, 1748, 314, 716, 62, 251, 274, 92, 627, 4, 571, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 70, 4, 386, 70, 2618, 2, 16803, 314, 137, 3254, 49, 230, 436, 274, 11, 4242, 6, 1693, 222, 6475, 9007, 23, 544, 1748, 314, 6, 1617, 30, 31, 129, 2, 578, 132, 2130, 132, 4, 3216, 46, 94, 255, 1748, 9007, 4, 1294, 3254, 49, 230, 251, 17, 2148, 571, 34, 369, 51051, 1693, 297, 22, 2743, 229, 189, 692, 6, 943, 15, 1682, 3254, 49, 230, 251, 4, 12, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 269, 72726, 213, 4281, 1630, 70]",1648.0,29739788,MAPK Reliance Acquired CDK4/6 Inhibitor Resistance,6,0.030927835051546393
Small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a clinicopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of 81 cases.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2018-05-12,"Small cell carcinoma (SmCC) of the bladder is a rare disease. We retrospectively studied a large series of bladder SmCC from a single institution. The patients included 69 men and 12 women with a mean age of 68 years. Most bladder SmCCs were presented at advanced stage, with tumors invading the muscularis propria and beyond (n = 77). SmCC was pure in 27 cases and mixed with other histologic types in 54 cases, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) (n = 32), UC in situ (n = 26), glandular (n = 14), micropapillary (n = 4), sarcomatoid (n = 4), squamous (n = 3), and plasmacytoid (n = 1) features. Most SmCCs expressed neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin (41/56), chromogranin (26/55), and CD56 (39/41); however, they did not express UC luminal markers CK20 (0/17), GATA3 (1/30), and uroplakin II (1/22). Some SmCCs showed focal expression of CK5/6 (9/25), a marker for the basal molecular subtype. Furthermore, expression of the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene protein was lost in most of the bladder SmCCs (2/23). The patients' survival was significantly associated with cancer stage but did not show a significant difference between mixed and pure SmCCs. Compared with conventional UC at similar stages, SmCC had a worse prognosis only when patients developed metastatic diseases. In conclusion, bladder SmCC is an aggressive disease that is frequently present at an advanced stage. A fraction of SmCCs show a basal molecular subtype, which may underlie its good response to chemotherapy. Inactivation of the RB1 gene may be implicated in the oncogenesis of bladder SmCC.",Comparative Study,619.0,4.0,Small carcinoma SmCC bladder rare disease retrospectively studied large series bladder SmCC single institution patients included 69 men 12 women mean age 68 years bladder SmCCs presented advanced stage invading muscularis propria n 77 SmCC pure 27 cases mixed histologic types 54 cases including urothelial carcinoma UC n 32 UC situ n 26 glandular n 14 micropapillary n 4 sarcomatoid n 4 squamous n 3 plasmacytoid n 1 features SmCCs expressed neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin 41/56 chromogranin 26/55 CD56 39/41 express UC luminal markers CK20 0/17 GATA3 1/30 uroplakin II 1/22 SmCCs showed focal expression CK5/6 9/25 marker basal molecular subtype Furthermore expression retinoblastoma 1 RB1 lost bladder SmCCs 2/23 patients survival significantly associated stage significant difference mixed pure SmCCs Compared conventional UC similar stages SmCC worse prognosis patients developed metastatic diseases bladder SmCC aggressive disease frequently present advanced stage fraction SmCCs basal molecular subtype underlie good response chemotherapy Inactivation RB1 implicated oncogenesis bladder SmCC,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[302, 31, 134, 17819, 1, 3, 16, 8, 622, 34, 21, 894, 656, 8, 375, 988, 1, 17819, 29, 8, 226, 731, 3, 7, 159, 790, 325, 2, 133, 117, 5, 8, 313, 89, 1, 806, 60, 96, 29980, 11, 917, 28, 131, 82, 5, 57, 8653, 3, 13936, 10859, 2, 1654, 78, 849, 17819, 10, 3092, 4, 428, 140, 2, 1739, 5, 127, 884, 630, 4, 667, 140, 141, 1472, 134, 2417, 78, 531, 2417, 4, 957, 78, 432, 6170, 78, 213, 6027, 78, 39, 3912, 78, 39, 691, 78, 27, 2, 7978, 78, 14, 404, 96, 29980, 570, 1542, 525, 12161, 605, 664, 8931, 432, 614, 2, 5803, 587, 605, 137, 491, 205, 44, 1669, 2417, 2496, 525, 10821, 13, 269, 8140, 14, 201, 2, 40894, 215, 14, 350, 476, 29980, 224, 2137, 55, 1, 13978, 49, 83, 243, 8, 952, 9, 3, 2135, 219, 875, 798, 55, 1, 3, 14, 4596, 145, 178, 10, 3009, 4, 96, 1, 3, 29980, 18, 382, 3, 7, 25, 10, 97, 41, 5, 12, 82, 84, 205, 44, 514, 8, 93, 523, 59, 1739, 2, 3092, 29980, 72, 5, 809, 2417, 28, 288, 1153, 17819, 42, 8, 639, 356, 158, 198, 7, 276, 113, 1342, 4, 1221, 17819, 16, 35, 571, 34, 17, 16, 746, 364, 28, 35, 131, 82, 8, 1509, 1, 29980, 514, 8, 2135, 219, 875, 92, 68, 5875, 211, 1178, 51, 6, 56, 2297, 1, 3, 4596, 145, 68, 40, 1771, 4, 3, 4503, 1, 17819]",1421.0,29763719,Small carcinoma urinary bladder clinicopathological immunohistochemical 81 cases,0,0.0
Mechanisms of therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2017-12-01,"Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors have advanced the treatment of metastatic breast cancer by targeting the cell cycle machinery, interrupting intracellular and mitogenic hormone signals that stimulate proliferation of malignant cells. Preclinical evidence demonstrated that derangements of cyclin D1, CDK4/6, and retinoblastoma expression are common in breast cancer, and suggested a therapeutic benefit from interrupting this axis required for cell cycle progression. Studies of cell lines and animal models of breast cancer have demonstrated the complex interplay between the cell cycle and estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth receptor 2 signaling, which informs our understanding of synergistic use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, as well as mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. Interestingly, estrogen receptor activity leads to upregulation of cyclin D1 expression, but the estrogen receptor is also in turn activated by cyclin D1, independent of estrogen binding. Early CDK inhibitors were nonspecific and limited by systemic toxicities, while the current generation of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Preclinical investigations of the three CDK4/6 inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) lend further insight into their mechanism of action, which will hopefully inform the future use and refinement of these therapies. Finally, we summarize evidence for additional novel CDK4/6 inhibitors currently in development.",Journal Article,781.0,7.0,Cyclin dependent kinase CDK 4/6 inhibitors advanced treatment metastatic breast targeting cycle machinery interrupting intracellular mitogenic hormone signals stimulate proliferation malignant Preclinical evidence demonstrated derangements cyclin D1 CDK4/6 retinoblastoma expression common breast suggested therapeutic benefit interrupting axis required cycle progression Studies lines animal models breast demonstrated complex interplay cycle estrogen receptor human epidermal growth receptor 2 signaling informs understanding synergistic use CDK4/6 inhibitors endocrine therapy mechanisms resistance endocrine therapy Interestingly estrogen receptor activity leads upregulation cyclin D1 expression estrogen receptor turn activated cyclin D1 independent estrogen binding Early CDK inhibitors nonspecific limited systemic toxicities current generation CDK4/6 inhibitors shown promise treatment hormone receptor-positive breast Preclinical investigations CDK4/6 inhibitors approved Food Drug Administration palbociclib ribociclib abemaciclib lend insight mechanism action hopefully inform future use refinement therapies Finally summarize evidence additional novel CDK4/6 inhibitors currently development,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1226, 470, 216, 3954, 39, 49, 222, 47, 131, 3, 24, 1, 113, 12, 20, 529, 3, 31, 417, 6415, 17164, 2087, 2, 8233, 785, 2312, 17, 4223, 457, 1, 393, 37, 693, 241, 264, 17, 16796, 1, 1226, 2146, 3254, 49, 2, 55, 32, 186, 4, 12, 2, 1148, 8, 189, 247, 29, 17164, 26, 2310, 616, 9, 31, 417, 91, 94, 1, 31, 285, 2, 2026, 274, 1, 12, 47, 264, 3, 840, 5709, 59, 3, 31, 417, 2, 808, 153, 2, 171, 829, 129, 153, 18, 314, 92, 12219, 114, 612, 1, 1806, 119, 1, 3254, 49, 222, 5, 1293, 36, 22, 149, 22, 483, 1, 251, 6, 1293, 36, 2873, 808, 153, 128, 1940, 6, 2218, 1, 1226, 2146, 55, 84, 3, 808, 153, 16, 120, 4, 3854, 735, 20, 1226, 2146, 306, 1, 808, 791, 191, 3954, 222, 11, 5893, 2, 383, 20, 403, 385, 369, 3, 291, 914, 1, 3254, 49, 222, 47, 443, 1783, 4, 3, 24, 1, 785, 153, 109, 12, 693, 2492, 1, 3, 169, 3254, 49, 222, 850, 20, 3, 843, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 4895, 7342, 2, 10140, 12248, 195, 2670, 237, 136, 670, 1, 1578, 92, 303, 7464, 2295, 3, 508, 119, 2, 7266, 1, 46, 235, 1368, 21, 2479, 241, 9, 402, 229, 3254, 49, 222, 694, 4, 193]",1524.0,29935900,Mechanisms therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibition breast,0,0.0
Current Treatment of Bilateral Retinoblastoma: The Impact of Intraarterial and Intravitreous Chemotherapy.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2018-06-22,"To evaluate the management and outcomes of naïve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at a single-center over a 5-year period during the era of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) and intravitreous chemotherapy. Retrospective cohort study of 46 patients (92 eyes) with naïve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 2012 and February 2017. Indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, ultrasonography, and ultrasonic biomicroscopy were used to evaluate clinical response. Patient, ocular, ocular progression-free, ocular recurrent event-free, and second ocular survivals were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Retinal toxicity was evaluated by electroretinography. Snellen visual acuity and complete blood count metrics were recorded. Sixty-four eyes (70%) in 41 patients (89%) received ophthalmic artery chemosurgery as part of their treatment. Twenty-six patients (56%) received tandem OAC (bilateral simultaneous infusions). Seven eyes were primarily enucleated. No eye receiving initial OAC was enucleated. There was a single secondary enucleation in an eye initially treated with focal therapy with anterior chamber recurrence. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall ocular, secondary ocular (survival after treatment for recurrence), progression-free, and recurrent event-free survival were 91.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 83.4-95.5], 98.7% (95% CI 91.3-99.8), 91.5% (95% CI 83.0-95.8), and 78.9% (95% CI 68.2-86.3), respectively. Overall and secondary ocular survivals were 100% for International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) groups A-C. Overall ocular survival was 91.5% (95% CI 70-97.8) for ICRB group D and 71.4% (95% CI 47.1-79.4) for group E. Secondary ocular survival was 95.4% (95% CI 71.8-99.3) for ICRB group D and 100% for group E. There were no treatment-related deaths, three patients developed trilateral retinoblastoma (one died), and one patient (who did not receive OAC) developed metastatic disease and is in remission at 32-month follow-up. The majority (89%) of bilateral retinoblastoma patients in the current era and at this center were treated with OAC. This has resulted in saving a historic number of eyes.

Cancer Res.,2018-08-21,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and highly malignant cancer that occurs in the bone and surrounding tissue of children and adolescents. The <i>EWS/ETS</i> fusion transcription factor that drives ES pathobiology was previously demonstrated to modulate cyclin D1 expression. In this study, we evaluated abemaciclib, a small-molecule CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4 and 6) inhibitor currently under clinical investigation in pediatric solid tumors, in preclinical models of ES. Using Western blot, high-content imaging, flow cytometry, ELISA, RNA sequencing, and CpG methylation assays, we characterized the <i>in vitro</i> response of ES cell lines to abemaciclib. We then evaluated abemaciclib <i>in vivo</i> in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of ES as either a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Abemaciclib induced quiescence in ES cell lines via a G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle block, characterized by decreased proliferation and reduction of Ki-67 and FOXM1 expression and retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation. In addition, abemaciclib reduced DNMT1 expression and promoted an inflammatory immune response as measured by cytokine secretion, antigen presentation, and interferon pathway upregulation. Single-agent abemaciclib reduced ES tumor volume in preclinical mouse models and, when given in combination with doxorubicin or temozolomide plus irinotecan, durable disease control was observed. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the antitumor effects of abemaciclib in preclinical ES models are multifaceted and include cell-cycle inhibition, DNA demethylation, and immunogenic changes.",Journal Article,518.0,4.0,Ewing sarcoma ES rare highly malignant occurs bone surrounding tissue children adolescents EWS/ETS /i fusion transcription factor drives ES pathobiology previously demonstrated modulate cyclin D1 expression evaluated abemaciclib small-molecule CDK4 CDK6 CDK4 6 inhibitor currently clinical investigation pediatric solid preclinical models ES Western blot high-content imaging flow cytometry ELISA RNA sequencing CpG methylation characterized vitro /i response ES lines abemaciclib evaluated abemaciclib vivo /i line-derived xenograft CDX patient-derived xenograft PDX mouse models ES monotherapy combination chemotherapy Abemaciclib induced quiescence ES lines G sub 1 /sub cell-cycle block characterized decreased proliferation reduction Ki-67 FOXM1 expression retinoblastoma RB phosphorylation addition abemaciclib reduced DNMT1 expression promoted inflammatory immune response measured cytokine secretion antigen presentation interferon pathway upregulation Single-agent abemaciclib reduced ES volume preclinical mouse models given combination doxorubicin temozolomide plus irinotecan durable disease control observed Collectively demonstrate antitumor effects abemaciclib preclinical ES models multifaceted include cell-cycle inhibition DNA demethylation immunogenic changes,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3011, 16, 8, 622, 2, 561, 393, 12, 17, 1780, 4, 3, 2, 2976, 246, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 3, 70, 4528, 4802, 70, 1212, 866, 161, 17, 5267, 3011, 8465, 10, 373, 264, 6, 3319, 1226, 2146, 55, 4, 26, 45, 21, 194, 10140, 8, 302, 1354, 3254, 2, 9518, 3254, 2, 49, 230, 694, 669, 38, 940, 4, 815, 537, 57, 4, 693, 274, 1, 3011, 75, 1521, 2639, 64, 2457, 270, 1412, 1914, 3664, 893, 615, 2, 2075, 569, 1013, 21, 765, 3, 70, 4, 439, 70, 51, 1, 3011, 31, 285, 6, 10140, 21, 818, 194, 10140, 70, 4, 386, 70, 4, 31, 328, 526, 1330, 12417, 2, 69, 526, 1330, 3250, 830, 274, 1, 3011, 22, 361, 8, 1411, 15, 4, 150, 5, 56, 10140, 277, 13957, 4, 3011, 31, 285, 847, 8, 499, 551, 14, 551, 31, 417, 2381, 765, 20, 340, 457, 2, 628, 1, 2311, 598, 2, 7899, 55, 2, 178, 2955, 982, 4, 352, 10140, 405, 7328, 55, 2, 2992, 35, 1291, 250, 51, 22, 644, 20, 1675, 2935, 448, 1031, 2, 1688, 308, 2218, 226, 420, 10140, 405, 3011, 30, 433, 4, 693, 830, 274, 2, 198, 447, 4, 150, 5, 856, 15, 1537, 349, 1071, 1480, 34, 182, 10, 164, 2535, 114, 74, 608, 17, 3, 579, 176, 1, 10140, 4, 693, 3011, 274, 32, 10076, 2, 643, 31, 417, 297, 261, 6800, 2, 4190, 400]",1570.0,30131386,Abemaciclib Active Preclinical Models Ewing Sarcoma Multipronged Regulation Cycle DNA Methylation Interferon Pathway Signaling,3,0.015463917525773196
Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,2018-02-01,"Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18·0 min (SD 9·5 per case). The Toronto Guidelines provide a highly functional framework that can be used to assign cancer stage at diagnosis using data routinely available in medical records for most childhood cancers. Data on staging have the potential to inform interventions targeting improved diagnosis and survival.

Lens Dose-Response Prediction Modeling and Cataract Incidence in Patients With Retinoblastoma After Lens-Sparing or Whole-Eye Radiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-12-08,"We retrospectively assessed the incidence of cataracts in patients with retinoblastoma (Rb) treated with either lens-sparing radiation therapy (LSRT) or whole-eye radiation therapy (WERT). A secondary aim of this study was to model the dose-response risk of cataract. We reviewed 65 patients with Rb treated with radiation therapy (RT) at Children's Hospital, Los Angeles from 1997 to 2015. Eyes that were enucleated before RT or lacked follow-up eye examinations were excluded. All patients underwent computed tomography simulation, and mean lens dose data were collected. Follow-up ophthalmologic examinations and intraocular lens implant history were reviewed for cataracts. The primary event-free survival (EFS) outcome was cataract development. Eyes without cataracts were censored on the last date of eye examination or post-RT enucleation, if applicable. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to compare EFS outcomes, and dose response was projected with Cox regression and logistic regression models. Sixty-one patients (94 eyes) were analyzed with a median follow-up of 51.8 months. For eyes treated with WERT, cataracts developed in 71.7% versus 35.3% for LSRT. Median EFS for WERT and LSRT were 20.8 and 67.9 months, respectively. Compared with WERT, a significant EFS benefit was demonstrated for LSRT (P < .001). Mean lens dose had a significant effect on cataracts in both Cox regression and logistic regression models (P < .01). The mean lens dose of 7 Gy was projected to have a 5-year cataract incidence of 20% and 25% with the logistic and Cox regression models, respectively.

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Science,2018-12-01,"Molecularly targeted therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for tumor growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model.

Stage at diagnosis for childhood solid cancers in Australia: A population-based study.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2019-03-01,"Stage of cancer at diagnosis is one of the strongest predictors of survival and is essential for population cancer surveillance, comparison of cancer outcomes and to guide national cancer control strategies. Our aim was to describe, for the first time, the distribution of cases by stage at diagnosis and differences in stage-specific survival on a population basis for a range of childhood solid cancers in Australia. The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and comprised children (<15 years) diagnosed with one of 12 solid malignancies between 2006 and 2014. Stage at diagnosis was assigned according to the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines. Observed (all cause) survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with follow-up on mortality available to 31 December 2015. Almost three-quarters (1256 of 1760 cases, 71%) of children in the study had localised or regional disease at diagnosis, varying from 43% for neuroblastoma to 99% for retinoblastoma. Differences in 5-year observed survival by stage were greatest for osteosarcoma (localised 85% (95% CI = 72%-93%) versus metastatic 37% (15%-59%)), neuroblastoma (localised 98% (91%-99%) versus metastatic 60% (52%-67%)), rhabdomyosarcoma (localised 85% (71%-93%) versus metastatic 53% (34%-69%)), and medulloblastoma (localised 69% (61%-75%) versus metastases to spine 42% (27%-57%)). The stage-specific information presented here provides a basis for comparison with other international population cancer registries.

Molecular targeted therapy of glioblastoma.,Cancer treatment reviews,Cancer Treat. Rev.,2019-09-11,"Glioblastomas are intrinsic brain tumors thought to originate from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells. More than 90% of glioblastomas are isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype tumors. Incidence increases with age, males are more often affected. Beyond rare instances of genetic predisposition and irradiation exposure, there are no known glioblastoma risk factors. Surgery as safely feasible followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define the standard of care since 2005. Except for prolonged progression-free, but not overall survival afforded by the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, no pharmacological intervention has been demonstrated to alter the course of disease. Specifically, targeting cellular pathways frequently altered in glioblastoma, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the p53 and the retinoblastoma (RB) pathways, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification or mutation, have failed to improve outcome, likely because of redundant compensatory mechanisms, insufficient target coverage related in part to the blood brain barrier, or poor tolerability and safety. Yet, uncommon glioblastoma subsets may exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable to targeted interventions, including, but not limited to: high tumor mutational burden, BRAF mutation, neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) or fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene fusions, and MET gene amplification or fusions. There is increasing interest in targeting not only the tumor cells, but also the microenvironment, including blood vessels, the monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment, or T cells. Improved clinical trial designs using pharmacodynamic endpoints in enriched patient populations will be required to develop better treatments for glioblastoma.",Journal Article,132.0,1.0,Glioblastomas intrinsic brain thought originate neuroglial stem progenitor 90 glioblastomas isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH -wildtype Incidence increases age males affected rare instances genetic predisposition irradiation exposure known glioblastoma risk factors Surgery safely feasible followed involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy define standard care 2005 prolonged progression-free overall survival afforded vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab pharmacological intervention demonstrated alter course disease Specifically targeting cellular pathways frequently altered glioblastoma phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K /protein kinase B AKT /mammalian target rapamycin mTOR p53 retinoblastoma RB pathways epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR amplification failed improve outcome likely redundant compensatory mechanisms insufficient target coverage related blood brain barrier poor tolerability safety uncommon glioblastoma subsets exhibit specific vulnerabilities amenable targeted interventions including limited high burden BRAF neurotrophic tryrosine receptor kinase NTRK fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR fusions MET amplification fusions increasing targeting microenvironment including blood vessels monocyte/macrophage/microglia compartment Improved clinical trial designs pharmacodynamic endpoints enriched patient populations required develop better treatments glioblastoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4729, 32, 2354, 342, 57, 2739, 6, 8838, 29, 35329, 452, 15, 2520, 37, 80, 76, 424, 1, 4729, 32, 5795, 2374, 3056, 10063, 57, 287, 1106, 5, 89, 2296, 32, 80, 629, 1424, 1654, 622, 5342, 1, 336, 2863, 2, 1104, 645, 125, 32, 77, 440, 996, 43, 130, 152, 22, 2268, 1313, 370, 20, 646, 1067, 310, 349, 1781, 2, 1146, 1537, 56, 1107, 3, 260, 1, 165, 1192, 1242, 2187, 9, 1069, 91, 115, 84, 44, 63, 25, 9150, 20, 3, 756, 845, 129, 161, 548, 599, 77, 3419, 788, 71, 85, 264, 6, 2688, 3, 906, 1, 34, 1225, 529, 763, 460, 746, 1495, 4, 996, 225, 22, 3, 4497, 27, 216, 974, 178, 216, 132, 649, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 3, 624, 2, 3, 2955, 460, 15, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 145, 1073, 15, 258, 47, 1551, 6, 401, 228, 322, 408, 1, 10716, 7084, 483, 3027, 283, 2139, 139, 4, 760, 6, 3, 315, 342, 3318, 15, 334, 1543, 2, 367, 1145, 2052, 996, 1890, 68, 2239, 112, 9614, 4070, 6, 238, 1151, 141, 84, 44, 383, 6, 64, 30, 1619, 892, 566, 258, 12967, 75070, 153, 216, 10498, 15, 3758, 129, 161, 153, 4453, 145, 2530, 2, 543, 145, 1073, 15, 2530, 125, 16, 602, 1333, 4, 529, 44, 158, 3, 30, 37, 84, 120, 3, 995, 141, 315, 3102, 3, 5231, 2674, 10871, 3616, 15, 102, 37, 231, 38, 160, 4120, 75, 2424, 1387, 4, 2220, 69, 1184, 303, 40, 616, 6, 690, 380, 640, 9, 996]",1860.0,31541850,Molecular targeted therapy glioblastoma,3,0.015463917525773196
