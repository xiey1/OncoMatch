Transformation in mycosis fungoides: the role of methotrexate.,Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,J Cutan Med Surg,2002-02-13,"Large cell transformation in patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) has been well reported in the literature. Although the risk factors have not been clearly elucidated, advanced stage seems to be associated with a higher incidence of transformation. Because MF is a rare disorder, little is known about the influence of other factors such as immunosuppressive therapy in the occurrence of transformation. We questioned the role of methotrexate (MTX) in the transformation of MF to large cell lymphoma (LCL). We identified all patients with MF who were registered in our cutaneous lymphoma database. Transformation was defined by the presence of large cells exceeding 25% of the infiltrate in at least one skin biopsy. In one patient, we followed the histologic, immunophenotypic, and genotypic changes taking place as transformation occurred. A total of 134 patients with MF were identified. Of 21 patients who received MTX, 3 transformed, and of the 113 patients in the non-MTX group, only 2 transformed. The incidence of transformation in the patients who received MTX was significantly higher than in those who did not receive the drug (14.3% vs. 1.8%; p = 0.03). This significance was maintained, even after controlling for stage and sex. For one patient who transformed, we demonstrated an identical dominant T-cell clone in all skin specimens, including the large cell lymphoma. Our results demonstrate a significant association between MTX exposure and transformation to LCL in patients with MF. In light of the small sample size, short followup of patients, and the inherent tendency of mycosis fungoides to transform, the role for MTX in transformation is unproven and needs to be confirmed in a multicenter study.",Journal Article,6551.0,9.0,Large transformation patients mycosis fungoides MF reported literature risk factors clearly elucidated advanced stage associated higher incidence transformation MF rare disorder little known influence factors immunosuppressive therapy occurrence transformation questioned role methotrexate MTX transformation MF large lymphoma LCL identified patients MF registered cutaneous lymphoma database Transformation defined presence large exceeding 25 infiltrate skin biopsy patient followed histologic immunophenotypic genotypic changes taking place transformation occurred total 134 patients MF identified 21 patients received MTX 3 transformed 113 patients non-MTX group 2 transformed incidence transformation patients received MTX significantly higher receive drug 14.3 vs. 1.8 p 0.03 significance maintained controlling stage sex patient transformed demonstrated identical dominant T-cell clone skin specimens including large lymphoma demonstrate significant association MTX exposure transformation LCL patients MF light small size short followup patients inherent tendency mycosis fungoides transform role MTX transformation unproven needs confirmed multicenter,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[375, 31, 1392, 4, 7, 5, 6789, 6744, 2966, 71, 85, 149, 210, 4, 3, 789, 242, 3, 43, 130, 47, 44, 85, 2536, 3901, 131, 82, 2744, 6, 40, 41, 5, 8, 142, 287, 1, 1392, 408, 2966, 16, 8, 622, 2645, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 1054, 1, 127, 130, 225, 22, 2989, 36, 4, 3, 2291, 1, 1392, 21, 9089, 3, 200, 1, 2116, 3453, 4, 3, 1392, 1, 2966, 6, 375, 31, 16216, 21, 108, 62, 7, 5, 2966, 54, 11, 1653, 4, 114, 1486, 609, 1392, 10, 395, 20, 3, 463, 1, 375, 37, 5178, 243, 1, 3, 5172, 4, 28, 506, 104, 411, 4, 104, 69, 21, 370, 3, 884, 6599, 2, 10030, 400, 2727, 3536, 22, 1392, 489, 8, 181, 1, 4842, 7, 5, 2966, 11, 108, 1, 239, 7, 54, 103, 3453, 27, 2423, 2, 1, 3, 4259, 7, 4, 3, 220, 3453, 87, 158, 18, 2423, 3, 287, 1, 1392, 4, 3, 7, 54, 103, 3453, 10, 97, 142, 76, 4, 135, 54, 205, 44, 560, 3, 234, 213, 27, 105, 14, 66, 19, 13, 680, 26, 724, 10, 1955, 871, 50, 1893, 9, 82, 2, 1035, 9, 104, 69, 54, 2423, 21, 264, 35, 3038, 2156, 102, 31, 3910, 4, 62, 623, 141, 3, 375, 31, 114, 99, 608, 8, 93, 248, 59, 3453, 645, 2, 1392, 6, 16216, 4, 7, 5, 2966, 4, 1691, 1, 3, 302, 1000, 444, 978, 3569, 1, 7, 2, 3, 4943, 7135, 1, 6789, 6744, 6, 7136, 3, 200, 9, 3453, 4, 1392, 16, 10048, 2, 1891, 6, 40, 557, 4, 8, 1570, 45]",1643.0,11992182,Transformation mycosis fungoides role methotrexate,0,0.0

The goal of the session is to succinctly review recent developments in lymphoma classification and treatment as they apply to the unique aspects of lymphoma when manifest in the skin. In Section I, Dr. Eric Hsi reviews the special characteristics of the lymphomas seen when they proliferate in the skin and the application of the new World Health Organization classification system to the cutaneous lymphomas, emphasizing the unique challenges of recognizing and correctly classifying these diseases. He summarizes the evidence in favor of including the skin lymphomas in the overall lymphoma classification scheme and concludes with a practical description of the specific skin lymphoma entities. In Section II, Dr. Joseph Connors describes the current optimal treatment of the B-cell lymphomas when they present in or metastasize to the skin. Building on the classification scheme described by Dr. Hsi, Dr. Connors outlines a treatment approach based on current understanding of pathophysiology of these diseases and application of each of the effective modalities available for cutaneous lymphoma including radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. In Section III, Dr. Francine Foss concludes the session with a discussion of the different T-cell lymphomas that start in or spread to the skin concentrating on mycosis fungoides, cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

"Management of mycosis fungoides. Part 1. Diagnosis, staging, and prognosis.","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2003-09-01,"Mycosis fungoides is a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder caused by CD4+ lymphocytes. It is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Typically, neoplastic T cells localize to the skin and produce patches, plaques, tumors, or erythroderma. Diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides can be difficult due to the nonspecific nature of cutaneous and histologic findings. However, recent advances in the application of histologic criteria, coupled with molecular biology tools such as immunophenotyping and polymerase chain reaction, have improved diagnostic accuracy. Independent prognostic factors include the extent and nature of skin involvement, the presence of extracutaneous disease, blood involvement, age > or = 60 years, and lactate dehydrogenase elevation.

"Comparison of selective retinoic acid receptor- and retinoic X receptor-mediated efficacy, tolerance, and survival in cutaneous t-cell lymphoma.",Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,J. Am. Acad. Dermatol.,2004-07-01,"Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with varied clinical presentation and prognosis. The most common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are the epidermotropic variants mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Treatment of mycosis fungoides has encompassed a variety of modalities including the use of retinoids with several studies evaluating their efficacy. The reported benefits and duration of response have varied in published data. The biological effect of retinoids is mediated by specific receptor families, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR), with subsequently altered gene expression. There are no data available on cutaneous T-cell lymphomas that compare RAR and RXR retinoids. The objective of our retrospective, nonrandomized, single-center study was to compare the response, survival outcomes, and toxic effects in our phase II trial of the RAR-specific retinoid, all-trans retinoic acid, with clinical use of the RXR-specific retinoid, bexarotene, in patients with mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome who have relapsed. There was no statistical difference in response rates (12% vs 21%), response duration (20.5 vs 7.3 months), event-free survival time (4 vs 5 months), or median survival when corrected for length of follow-up. Both have favorable toxicity profiles that can be managed with medications. The toxicity profile caused by bexarotene seems to be more limited to laboratory values and better tolerated, although generally associated with more severe grades of toxicity. In conclusion, both retinoids have modest objective response rates and, therefore, most likely will have limited impact as monotherapeutic agents. However, the immunomodulatory effects of RAR and RXR retinoids provide a rational basis for using retinoids in combination with other biologic immune response modifiers, phototherapy, or cytotoxic chemotherapy.",Clinical Trial,5682.0,39.0,Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas varied clinical presentation prognosis common subtypes cutaneous T-cell lymphomas epidermotropic mycosis fungoides Sézary syndrome Treatment mycosis fungoides encompassed variety modalities including use retinoids studies evaluating efficacy reported benefits duration response varied published effect retinoids mediated specific receptor families retinoic acid receptor RAR retinoic X receptor RXR subsequently altered expression available cutaneous T-cell lymphomas compare RAR RXR retinoids objective retrospective nonrandomized single-center compare response survival outcomes toxic effects phase II trial RAR-specific retinoid all-trans retinoic acid clinical use RXR-specific retinoid bexarotene patients mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome relapsed statistical difference response rates 12 vs 21 response duration 20.5 vs 7.3 months event-free survival time 4 vs 5 months median survival corrected length follow-up favorable toxicity profiles managed medications toxicity profile caused bexarotene limited laboratory values better tolerated generally associated severe grades toxicity retinoids modest objective response rates likely limited impact monotherapeutic agents immunomodulatory effects RAR RXR retinoids provide rational basis retinoids combination biologic immune response modifiers phototherapy cytotoxic chemotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[86, 1486, 102, 31, 1557, 32, 292, 1557, 5, 2051, 38, 1031, 2, 356, 3, 96, 186, 814, 1, 1486, 102, 31, 1557, 32, 3, 30507, 839, 6789, 6744, 2, 9939, 681, 24, 1, 6789, 6744, 71, 9226, 8, 1362, 1, 1558, 141, 3, 119, 1, 7358, 5, 392, 94, 1435, 136, 209, 3, 210, 1141, 2, 654, 1, 51, 47, 2051, 4, 983, 74, 3, 1037, 254, 1, 7358, 16, 517, 20, 112, 153, 1954, 3887, 971, 153, 7533, 2, 3887, 1006, 153, 11383, 5, 1611, 1495, 145, 55, 125, 32, 77, 74, 390, 23, 1486, 102, 31, 1557, 17, 932, 7533, 2, 11383, 7358, 3, 461, 1, 114, 459, 5666, 226, 574, 45, 10, 6, 932, 3, 51, 25, 123, 2, 1812, 176, 4, 114, 124, 215, 160, 1, 3, 7533, 112, 6709, 62, 3437, 3887, 971, 5, 38, 119, 1, 3, 11383, 112, 6709, 9106, 4, 7, 5, 6789, 6744, 9939, 681, 54, 47, 591, 125, 10, 77, 1050, 523, 4, 51, 151, 133, 105, 239, 51, 654, 179, 33, 105, 67, 27, 53, 774, 115, 25, 98, 39, 105, 33, 53, 15, 52, 25, 198, 3848, 9, 1318, 1, 166, 126, 110, 47, 913, 155, 1241, 17, 122, 40, 2231, 5, 2679, 3, 155, 800, 1546, 20, 9106, 2744, 6, 40, 80, 383, 6, 1624, 1030, 2, 380, 421, 242, 1228, 41, 5, 80, 905, 2276, 1, 155, 4, 1221, 110, 7358, 47, 1721, 461, 51, 151, 2, 673, 96, 322, 303, 47, 383, 345, 22, 28161, 183, 137, 3, 2555, 176, 1, 7533, 2, 11383, 7358, 377, 8, 2696, 877, 9, 75, 7358, 4, 150, 5, 127, 1283, 250, 51, 5663, 21263, 15, 759, 56]",1849.0,15243520,Comparison selective retinoic acid receptor- retinoic X receptor-mediated efficacy tolerance survival cutaneous t-cell lymphoma,7,0.125
Long-term follow-up of patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who achieved complete remission with psoralen plus UV-A monotherapy.,Archives of dermatology,Arch Dermatol,2005-03-01,"To evaluate long-term outcomes, impact of maintenance therapy and potential curability of patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) treated with psoralen plus UV-A (PUVA) monotherapy. Single-center retrospective cohort analysis. Academic referral center for cutaneous lymphoma. A total of 66 of 104 patients with clinical stages IA to IIA MF who achieved complete remission (CR) after PUVA monotherapy between 1979 and 1995. Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival and disease-free survival curves were compared between stage IA and IB/IIA cases. Patients were stratified into relapse and nonrelapse groups based on whether their MF relapsed during study follow-up. Baseline characteristics and treatment were compared between these groups. Median follow-up time was 94 months (range, 5-242 months). Thirty-three patients maintained CR for 84 months (range, 5-238 months), and 33 patients experienced relapse with a median disease-free interval of 39 months (range, 2-127 months). There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between patients in the nonrelapse and relapse groups. Those in the nonrelapse group received a higher cumulative dosage to CR (P = .03) and required longer treatment periods to achieve CR (P = .03). Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years for all patients with stage IA were 56% and 30%, respectively, and for stage IB/IIA, 74% and 50%. Actuarial survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 94%, 82%, and 82%, respectively, in patients with stage IA, and 80%, 69%, and 58% in patients with stage IB/IIA. The overall survival rate for the nonrelapse and relapse groups did not show any statistical difference. One third of the patients developed signs of chronic photodamage and secondary cutaneous malignancies.

Pathol.,2005-10-01,"Heat-shock protein-90 (HSP90) inhibitors are currently being used in phase I clinical trials for treating patients with a variety of neoplasms including lymphomas. Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed for HSP90 expression in 412 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In B-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in all cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (5/5, 100%), and in subsets of follicular lymphoma (17/28, 61%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (27/46, 59%), nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (6/16, 38%), plasma cell neoplasms (14/39, 36%), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3/9, 33%), mantle cell lymphoma (12/38, 32%) and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (3/10, 30%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in six of 14 (43%) cases of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. In T-cell lymphomas, HSP90 was moderately to strongly expressed in subsets of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (14/24, 58%; 9/12 ALK+ and 5/12 ALK-), precursor-T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (20/65, 31%), unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma (8/43, 23%) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (2/17, 12%). HSP90 was weakly expressed in seven of 58 (12%) cases of mycosis fungoides. We conclude that HSP90 is commonly expressed in a subset of many types of B- and T-cell lymphoma.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-09-01,"Sezary syndrome (SS) and tumor-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) are generally incurable with currently available treatments. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in this patient population. From August 1996 through October 2002, eight patients with advanced MF/SS underwent allogeneic HSCT at our institution. All patients were heavily pretreated, having failed a median number of seven prior therapies (range, five to 12). Clonal T-cell populations in peripheral blood or bone marrow were detectable by polymerase chain reaction analyses of T-cell receptor gamma-chain gene rearrangements in six patients and cytogenetics in three patients. The conditioning regimen included total-body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (n = 3), busulfan and cyclophosphamide (n = 1), and the reduced-intensity regimen of fludarabine and melphalan (n = 4). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells were obtained from HLA-matched siblings (n = 4) and unrelated donors (n = 4). All patients achieved complete clinical remission and resolution of molecular and cytogenetic markers of disease within 30 to 60 days after HSCT. Two patients died from transplantation-related complications; graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; n = 1) and respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (n = 1). With a median follow-up of 56 months, six patients remain alive and without evidence of lymphoma.

Bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Expert Opin Pharmacother,2006-05-01,"Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas encompass a spectrum of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that are characterised by clonal proliferation of skin-homing malignant T lymphocytes. Mycosis fungoides and the leukaemic variant Sézary syndrome, collectively referred to as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, are the most common entities. No curative therapy exists and patients ultimately develop advanced or relapsed disease that is refractory to standard treatment options. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of novel emerging therapies. Bexarotene is the first synthetic nuclear retinoid X receptor-selective retinoid approved by the FDA for the treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in all stages, as both an oral capsule and a topical gel formulation.

The characteristic clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features and prognoses of the various cutaneous lymphomas have been recently described by the World Health Organization and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma variants include mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, which are generally associated, respectively, with indolent and aggressive clinical courses and are the subject of this review. Currently utilized treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include skin-directed therapies (topical agents such as corticosteroids, mechlorethamine, carmustine, and retinoids, phototherapy, superficial radiotherapy, and total skin electron beam therapy), systemic therapies (photophoresis, retinoids, denileukin diftitox, interferons, and chemotherapy), and stem cell transplantation (autologous and allogeneic). This review will describe recent advances in our understanding of the biology (immunologic, cytogenetic, and genetic) of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and discuss the efficacy and tolerability of the current therapeutic options for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Disease progression in over 20% of patients with early stages of disease and the current lack of a definitive treatment which produces durable responses in advanced stages of disease indicates a critical unmet need in CTCL.

In both cases, the neoplasms were composed of atypical lymphoid cells with epidermotropism and were of T-helper cell lineage (CD4+). The initial lesions were also negative for CD30. Identical T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were detected in the initial and recurrent lesions of one case. Although these neoplasms were classified as unspecified peripheral T-cell lymphoma because of the unusual distribution of disease, both cases also had histopathologic features of mycosis fungoides.

Two major competing classifications were the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).

We review the classification of ""mature"" or peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with high predilection to the skin as published by the WHO-EORTC. We also highlight new information and changes from the previous classifications of cutaneous PTCL according to the WHO classification or the EORTC classification. Finally, the salient findings are compared with similar-looking nodal PTCLs with a high frequency of skin involvement. This review focuses on a rare group of cutaneous PTCLs other than mycosis fungoides or its variants. Changes from the previous classifications are discussed, and the rare group of nodal PTCLs with high predilection to the skin are presented. The salient findings, diagnostic features, and treatments are included, along with summary tables and clinical-histopathologic images. This review may serve as a guide for hematologists, oncologists and dermatologists in the diagnosis and management of these rare, aggressive, and often difficult to diagnose lymphomas.

Patients with stage IB-IVA MF/SS were treated with 400 mg of oral vorinostat daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity in this open-label phase IIb trial (NCT00091559). Patients must have received at least two prior systemic therapies at least one of which included bexarotene unless intolerable. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) measured by the modified severity weighted assessment tool and secondary end points were time to response (TTR), time to progression (TTP), duration of response (DOR), and pruritus relief ( > or = 3-point improvement on a 10-point visual analog scale). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Seventy-four patients were enrolled, including 61 with at least stage IIB disease. The ORR was 29.7% overall; 29.5% in stage IIB or higher patients. Median TTR in stage IIB or higher patients was 56 days. Median DOR was not reached but estimated to be >or = 185 days (34+ to 441+). Median TTP was 4.9 months overall, and 9.8 months for stage IIB or higher responders. Overall, 32% of patients had pruritus relief.

The most common lymphoproliferative disorder associated with LyP is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: mycosis fungoides. We sought to describe a distinct entity on the spectrum of CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. Seven patients presented with similar findings. Within a well-circumscribed area, the size and location of a patch of mycosis fungoides, these patients had continual eruptions of papulonodules that were histologically typical of LyP. The localized areas of involvement were treated as oligolesional mycosis fungoides and long-standing remissions occurred even after years of experiencing continuous localized eruptions. The clinical and histologic findings are reviewed and presented in a way to further the identification of patients with this entity. This distinct entity is only defined by 7 patients.

Current and emerging treatment strategies for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.,Drugs,Drugs,2010-02-01,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a rare group of mature T-cell lymphomas presenting primarily in the skin. The most common subtypes of CTCL are mycosis fungoides and its leukaemic variant Sézary's syndrome. Patients with early-stage disease frequently have an indolent clinical course; however, those with advanced stages have a shortened survival. For the treating physician, the question of how to choose a particular therapy in the management of CTCL is important. These diseases span the disciplines of dermatology, medical oncology and radiation oncology. Other than an allogeneic stem cell transplant, there are no curative therapies for this disease. Hence, many treatment modalities need to be offered to the patient over the course of their life. An accepted treatment approach has been to delay traditional chemotherapy, which can cause excessive toxicity without durable benefit. More conservative treatment strategies in the initial management of CTCL have led to the development of newer biological and targeted therapies. These therapies include biological immune enhancers such as interferon alpha and extracorporeal photopheresis that exert their effect by stimulating an immune response to the tumour cells. Retinoids such as bexarotene have been shown to be effective and well tolerated with predictable adverse effects. The fusion toxin denileukin diftitox targets the interleukin-2 receptor expressed on malignant T cells. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat and romidepsin (depsipeptide) may reverse the epigenetic states associated with cancer. Forodesine is a novel inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and leads to apoptosis of malignant T cells. Pralatrexate is a novel targeted antifolate that targets the reduced folate carrier in cancer cells. Lastly, systemic chemotherapy including transplantation is used when rapid disease control is needed or if all other biological therapies have failed. As response rates to most of the biological agents used to treat CTCL are 25-30%, it is also reasonable to consider clinical trials with novel agents if one or two front-line therapies have failed, especially before considering chemotherapy.

Diagnosis and management of mycosis fungoides.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2010-05-01,"Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is a low-grade cutaneous lymphoma characterized by skin-homing CD4+ T cells. It is notable for highly symptomatic progressive skin lesions, including patches, plaques, tumors, and erytheroderma, and has a poorer prognosis at later stages. Diagnosis remains difficult owing to MF's nonspecific skin presentation and identification of the optimal treatment strategy is challenging given the paucity of controlled trials and numerous and emerging treatment options. Management includes topical therapy with the addition of systemic therapy for patients with later-stage disease including tumors; erythroderma; and nodal, visceral, or blood involvement. Topical therapies include mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), carmustine (BCNU), steroids, bexarotene gel (Targretin Gel), psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and either localized or total skin electron radiotherapy. Systemic therapies include interferon, retinoids, oral bexarotene (Targretin), denileukin diftitox (Ontak), vorinostat (Zolinza), extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis), and cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Pathol.,2010-12-17,"Current pathologic criteria cannot reliably distinguish cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma from other CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphomatoid papulosis, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma with skin involvement, and transformed mycosis fungoides). We previously reported IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor-4) translocations in cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Here, we investigated the clinical utility of detecting IRF4 translocations in skin biopsies. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for IRF4 in 204 biopsies involved by T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders from 182 patients at three institutions. In all, 9 of 45 (20%) cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphomas and 1 of 32 (3%) cases of lymphomatoid papulosis with informative results demonstrated an IRF4 translocation. Remaining informative cases were negative for a translocation (7 systemic anaplastic large cell lymphomas; 44 cases of mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (13 transformed); 24 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, not otherwise specified; 12 CD4-positive small/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas; 5 extranodal NK/T-cell lymphomas, nasal type; 4 gamma-delta T-cell lymphomas; and 5 other uncommon T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders). Among all cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, FISH for IRF4 had a specificity and positive predictive value for cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma of 99 and 90%, respectively (P=0.00002, Fisher's exact test). Among anaplastic large cell lymphomas, lymphomatoid papulosis, and transformed mycosis fungoides, specificity and positive predictive value were 98 and 90%, respectively (P=0.005). FISH abnormalities other than translocations and IRF4 protein expression were seen in 13 and 65% of cases, respectively, but were nonspecific with regard to T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder subtype. Our findings support the clinical utility of FISH for IRF4 in the differential diagnosis of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in skin biopsies, with detection of a translocation favoring cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Open-label, dose-escalation, phase I trial. Dermatology outpatient clinic and clinical research unit at a university teaching hospital. A total of 21 adult patients (11 male, 10 female)with early-stage (IA-IIA) refractory CTCL, mycosis fungoides type, treated with topical carmustine following intravenous O6-benzylguanine. Treatment once every 2 weeks with 120 mg/m(2) intravenous O6-benzylguanine followed 1 hour later by whole-body, low-dose topical carmustine starting at 10 mg, with 10-mg incremental dose-escalation in 3 patient cohorts. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma lesional skin biopsy specimens were taken at baseline and 6 hours, 24 hours, and 1 week after the first O6-benzylguanine infusion for analysis of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity. Clinical response measured by physical examination and severity-weighted assessment tool measurements, safety data acquired by review of adverse events at study visits, and O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity in treated lesion skin biopsy specimens. A minimal toxic effect was observed through the 40-mg carmustine dose level with 76% of adverse events being grade 1 based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Mean baseline O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity in CTCL lesions was 3 times greater than in normal controls and was diminished by a median of 100% at 6 and 24 hours following O6-benzylguanine with recovery at 1 week. Clinical disease reduction correlated positively with O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity at 168 hours (P=.02) and inversely with area under the curve of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase over 1 week (P=.01).

Skin effector memory T cells do not recirculate and provide immune protection in alemtuzumab-treated CTCL patients.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2012-01-01,"Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a cancer of skin-homing T cells with variants that include leukemic CTCL (L-CTCL), a malignancy of central memory T cells (T(CM)), and mycosis fungoides (MF), a malignancy of skin resident effector memory T cells (T(EM)). We report that low-dose alemtuzumab (αCD52) effectively treated patients with refractory L-CTCL but not MF. Alemtuzumab depleted all T cells in blood and depleted both benign and malignant T(CM) from skin, but a diverse population of skin resident T(EM) remained in skin after therapy. T cell depletion with alemtuzumab required the presence of neutrophils, a cell type frequent in blood but rare in normal skin. These data suggest that T(CM) were depleted because they recirculate between the blood and the skin, whereas skin resident T(EM) were spared because they are sessile and non-recirculating. After alemtuzumab treatment, skin T cells produced lower amounts of interleukin-4 and higher amounts of interferon-γ. Moreover, there was a marked lack of infections in alemtuzumab-treated L-CTCL patients despite the complete absence of T cells in the blood, suggesting that skin resident T(EM) can protect the skin from pathogens even in the absence of T cell recruitment from the circulation. Together, these data suggest that alemtuzumab may treat refractory L-CTCL without severely compromising the immune response to infection by depleting circulating T(CM) but sparing the skin resident T(EM) that provide local immune protection of the skin.",Journal Article,2942.0,191.0,Cutaneous lymphoma CTCL skin-homing include leukemic CTCL L-CTCL malignancy central memory CM mycosis fungoides MF malignancy skin resident effector memory EM report low-dose alemtuzumab αCD52 effectively treated patients refractory L-CTCL MF Alemtuzumab depleted blood depleted benign malignant CM skin diverse population skin resident EM remained skin therapy depletion alemtuzumab required presence neutrophils type frequent blood rare normal skin suggest CM depleted recirculate blood skin skin resident EM spared sessile non-recirculating alemtuzumab treatment skin produced lower amounts interleukin-4 higher amounts interferon-γ marked lack infections alemtuzumab-treated L-CTCL patients despite complete absence blood suggesting skin resident EM protect skin pathogens absence recruitment circulation suggest alemtuzumab treat refractory L-CTCL severely compromising immune response infection depleting circulating CM sparing skin resident EM provide local immune protection skin,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1486, 102, 31, 4742, 16, 8, 12, 1, 6290, 5515, 102, 37, 5, 839, 17, 643, 2015, 4742, 805, 4742, 8, 710, 1, 854, 2407, 102, 37, 102, 494, 2, 6789, 6744, 2966, 8, 710, 1, 8185, 2070, 2407, 102, 37, 102, 7393, 21, 414, 17, 154, 61, 3579, 61016, 1856, 73, 7, 5, 430, 805, 4742, 84, 44, 2966, 3579, 4358, 62, 102, 37, 4, 315, 2, 4358, 110, 1002, 2, 393, 102, 494, 29, 84, 8, 1867, 266, 1, 8185, 102, 7393, 958, 4, 50, 36, 102, 31, 2286, 5, 3579, 616, 3, 463, 1, 5700, 8, 31, 267, 908, 4, 315, 84, 622, 4, 295, 46, 74, 309, 17, 102, 494, 11, 4358, 408, 491, 61017, 59, 3, 315, 2, 3, 547, 8185, 102, 7393, 11, 6830, 408, 491, 32, 10761, 2, 220, 43521, 50, 3579, 24, 102, 37, 1687, 280, 4939, 1, 1603, 39, 2, 142, 4939, 1, 1688, 2655, 1393, 125, 10, 8, 2003, 926, 1, 1875, 4, 3579, 73, 805, 4742, 7, 550, 3, 236, 1127, 1, 102, 37, 4, 3, 315, 802, 17, 8185, 102, 7393, 122, 4869, 3, 29, 9275, 871, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 102, 31, 3202, 29, 3, 4984, 1162, 46, 74, 309, 17, 3579, 68, 943, 430, 805, 4742, 187, 7207, 6102, 3, 250, 51, 6, 930, 20, 9438, 1033, 102, 494, 84, 1851, 3, 8185, 102, 7393, 17, 377, 293, 250, 3525, 1, 3]",1400.0,22261031,Skin effector memory recirculate provide immune protection alemtuzumab-treated CTCL patients,14,0.25
"Identification of an active, well-tolerated dose of pralatrexate in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",Blood,Blood,2012-03-06,"Systemic treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) involves the use of less aggressive, well-tolerated therapies. Pralatrexate is a novel antifolate with high affinity for reduced folate carrier-1. A dose de-escalation strategy identified recommended pralatrexate dosing for patients with CTCL that demonstrated high activity, good rates of disease control, and an acceptable toxicity profile for continuous long-term dosing. Eligibility included mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, or primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, with disease progression after ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy. The starting dose and schedule was 30 mg/m(2)/wk intravenously for 3 of 4 (3/4) weeks. Subsequent starting doses were 20, 15, and 10 mg/m(2)/wk for 3/4 or 2 of 3 (2/3) weeks. Response was evaluated by the modified severity-weighted adjustment tool. Fifty-four patients were treated. The recommended regimen was identified as 15 mg/m(2)/wk for 3/4 weeks and was explored in the expansion cohort. In 29 patients treated overall with the recommended dosing regimen, the median number of prior systemic therapies was 4. Pralatrexate was administered for a median of 4 cycles; response rate was 45%. The most common grade 3 adverse event (AE) was mucositis (17%); the only grade 4 AE was leukopenia (3%).

Pralatrexate is an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory transformed mycosis fungoides: a subgroup efficacy analysis from the PROPEL study.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2012-04-26,"Transformed mycosis fungoides (tMF) is an aggressive disease with a median survival of 12-24 months. In this retrospective analysis of 12 patients with tMF, treatment with pralatrexate resulted in an objective response of 25% per independent central review and 58% per investigator assessment. Pralatrexate was well tolerated, with no toxicity-related discontinuations, which makes this an additional option for tMF treatment. Transformed mycosis fungoides (tMF) is an aggressive disease, with poor prognosis and a median survival of 24 months. In the Pralatrexate in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PROPEL) study, 12 patients with tMF were treated with a median of 10 pralatrexate doses (starting dose of 30 mg/m(2)) administered weekly for 6 weeks in a 7-week cycle. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3. This retrospective analysis showed that the objective response rate in this subgroup was 25% (n = 3) per independent central review and 58% (n = 7) per investigator assessment, with this discrepancy likely attributed to challenges with photodocumentation of cutaneous lesions. The median duration of response and the median progression-free survival were 2.2 and 1.7 months, respectively, per central review, whereas median duration of response was 4.4 months, and median progression-free survival was 5.3 months per investigator assessment.

Outcome of patients treated with a single-fraction dose of palliative radiation for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-07-17,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a radiosensitive tumor. Presently, treatment with radiation is given in multiple fractions. The current literature lacks data that support single-fraction treatment for CTCL. This retrospective review assesses the clinical response in patients treated with a single fraction of radiation. This study reviewed the records of 58 patients with CTCL, primarily mycosis fungoides, treated with a single fraction of palliative radiation therapy (RT) between October 1991 and January 2011. Patient and tumor characteristics were reviewed. Response rates were compared using Fisher's exact test and multiple logistic regressions. Survival rates were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to assess the cost of a single vs a multifractionated treatment regimen. Two hundred seventy individual lesions were treated, with the majority (97%) treated with ≥ 700 cGy; mean follow-up was 41.3 months (range, 3-180 months). Response rate by lesion was assessed, with a complete response (CR) in 255 (94.4%) lesions, a partial response in 10 (3.7%) lesions, a partial response converted to a CR after a second treatment in 4 (1.5%) lesions, and no response in 1 (0.4%) lesion. The CR in lower extremity lesions was lower than in other sites (P=.0016). Lesions treated with photons had lower CR than those treated with electrons (P=.017). Patients with lesions exhibiting large cell transformation and tumor morphology had lower CR (P=.04 and P=.035, respectively). Immunophenotype did not impact response rate (P=.23). Overall survival was significantly lower for patients with Sézary syndrome (P=.0003) and erythroderma (P<.0001). The cost of multifractionated radiation was >200% higher than that for single-fraction radiation. A single fraction of 700 cGy-800 cGy provides excellent palliation for CTCL lesions and is cost effective and convenient for the patient.",Evaluation Study,2744.0,49.0,Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma CTCL radiosensitive Presently treatment radiation given multiple fractions current literature lacks support single-fraction treatment CTCL retrospective review assesses clinical response patients treated single fraction radiation reviewed records 58 patients CTCL primarily mycosis fungoides treated single fraction palliative radiation therapy RT October 1991 January 2011 Patient characteristics reviewed Response rates compared Fisher 's exact test multiple logistic regressions Survival rates determined Kaplan-Meier Cost-effectiveness performed assess cost single vs multifractionated treatment regimen seventy individual lesions treated majority 97 treated ≥ 700 cGy mean follow-up 41.3 months range 3-180 months Response rate lesion assessed complete response CR 255 94.4 lesions partial response 10 3.7 lesions partial response converted CR second treatment 4 1.5 lesions response 1 0.4 lesion CR lower extremity lesions lower sites P=.0016 Lesions treated photons lower CR treated electrons P=.017 Patients lesions exhibiting large transformation morphology lower CR P=.04 P=.035 respectively Immunophenotype impact response rate P=.23 Overall survival significantly lower patients Sézary syndrome P=.0003 erythroderma P .0001 cost multifractionated radiation 200 higher single-fraction radiation single fraction 700 cGy-800 cGy provides excellent palliation CTCL lesions cost effective convenient patient,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1486, 102, 31, 4742, 16, 8, 9478, 30, 9083, 24, 5, 121, 16, 447, 4, 232, 1550, 3, 291, 789, 6856, 74, 17, 538, 226, 1509, 24, 9, 4742, 26, 459, 206, 7777, 3, 38, 51, 4, 7, 73, 5, 8, 226, 1509, 1, 121, 26, 45, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 717, 7, 5, 4742, 1561, 6789, 6744, 73, 5, 8, 226, 1509, 1, 994, 121, 36, 240, 59, 2551, 3372, 2, 1024, 1132, 69, 2, 30, 374, 11, 446, 51, 151, 11, 72, 75, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 2, 232, 812, 5142, 25, 151, 11, 509, 75, 3, 876, 882, 596, 835, 1236, 65, 10, 173, 6, 423, 3, 835, 1, 8, 226, 105, 8, 34313, 24, 477, 100, 1128, 2073, 797, 406, 11, 73, 5, 3, 686, 1015, 73, 5, 749, 5692, 3071, 313, 166, 126, 10, 605, 27, 53, 184, 27, 3172, 53, 51, 116, 20, 1180, 10, 275, 5, 8, 236, 51, 684, 4, 7826, 960, 39, 406, 8, 450, 51, 4, 79, 27, 67, 406, 8, 450, 51, 4764, 6, 8, 684, 50, 8, 419, 24, 4, 39, 14, 33, 406, 2, 77, 51, 4, 14, 13, 39, 1180, 3, 684, 4, 280, 2678, 406, 10, 280, 76, 4, 127, 633, 19, 13230, 406, 73, 5, 7862, 42, 280, 684, 76, 135, 73, 5, 13785, 19, 3825, 7, 5, 406, 4801, 375, 31, 1392, 2, 30, 2567, 42, 280, 684, 19, 755, 2, 19, 4514, 106, 5496, 205, 44, 345, 51, 116, 19, 382, 63, 25, 10, 97, 280, 9, 7, 5, 9939, 681, 19, 4418, 2, 21999, 19, 488, 3, 835, 1, 34313, 121, 10, 1250, 142, 76, 17, 9, 226, 1509, 121, 8, 226, 1509, 1, 5692, 3071, 2796, 3071, 777, 1503, 3695, 9, 4742, 406, 2, 16, 835, 323, 2, 7048, 9, 3, 69]",1858.0,22818412,Outcome patients treated single-fraction dose palliative radiation cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,0,0.0
"Age, race, sex, stage, and incidence of cutaneous lymphoma.","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2012-10-01,"The T- and B-cell cutaneous lymphomas (CLs) are relatively rare, and information regarding clinical presentation and differences among racial groups might be helpful in determining the best course of clinical care. Data from nearly 5000 patients with CL from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program) registry were evaluated. Nonwhite racial groups present with mycosis fungoides (MF) at an earlier age compared with white, and African American (AA) have increased risk of presenting with higher T-stage compared with white patients. These findings have significant implications regarding need for earlier diagnosis and understanding the reasons for racial disparity in age and stage of presentation. The incidence of the T- and B-cell CLs has been well documented, but information pertaining to racial incidence by age, and by burden of disease (stage) have not been extensively documented. The SEER 2004-2008 public use database was investigated. The relative incidence of CL in different races and age groups was examined. Univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression was performed for the likelihood of presenting at a higher stage. Of 4496 patients diagnosed with CL between 2004 and 2008; 1713 patients were diagnosed with MF, 1518 with non-MF cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and 1265 patients with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. For MF, there was a trend for females to be less likely to present with a higher T-stage (T3-T4) than males (odds ratio [OR], 0.73) on multivariate analysis (P = .06). For race, AA had a significantly increased risk of presenting with higher T-stage (T3-T4) MF (OR, 1.72) on multivariate analysis (P = .02), compared with white patients. For white, AA, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Native American/other/unknown, the mean age at diagnosis was 59.2, 51.5, 51.3, and 53.8. These groups presented at a significantly different age than white (P = .0001, 0.0001, and 0.0006). Nonwhite racial groups present with MF at an earlier age compared with white, and AA have increased risk of presenting with higher T-stage compared with white.

Results of an open-label multicenter phase 2 trial of lenalidomide monotherapy in refractory mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.,Blood,Blood,2013-12-11,"A phase 2 multicenter trial was performed to evaluate single-agent lenalidomide in advanced, refractory mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome. Thirty-two patients were enrolled with a median of 6 prior treatment regimens, including a median of 4 systemic therapies. Patients achieved an overall response rate of 28% (9 patients), and all were partial responses. Median overall survival was 43 months, median progression-free survival was 8 months, and median duration of response was 10 months. No grade 4 toxicities occurred. Grade 3 adverse events included fatigue (22%), infection (9%), and leukopenia (3%). Patients were frequently unable to tolerate the 25-mg starting dose of lenalidomide used in other hematologic malignancies due to fatigue, pain, and transient flare reaction (TFR) as a contributory factor. TFR appeared to correlate with clinical response, but the small sample size limited definitive conclusions, and the underlying mechanisms of this reaction are not known. Data from correlative studies on peripheral blood samples suggest that the effects of lenalidomide could be associated with decreased circulating CD25(+) T cells and CD4(+) T-cell numbers. Skin lesions showed a trend for increased CD8, CD25, and FoxP3 expression with decreased CD4:CD8 ratio.

Excimer laser in the treatment of mycosis fungoides.,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,J. Am. Acad. Dermatol.,2014-04-26,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which typically presents as a patch or plaque in early-stage disease. Phototherapy including psoralen plus ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B are well-established treatment modalities in management of early-stage MF. Only a limited number of reports have evaluated the efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser in therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of 308-nm excimer laser (XTRAC, PhotoMedex, Montgomeryville, PA) in patients with stage IA to IIA MF. We reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 6 consecutive patients given the diagnosis of refractory MF who underwent treatment with excimer laser. We found that the 308-nm excimer laser is a safe and well-tolerated alternative therapy for early-stage MF. In addition, we were able to delineate criteria to help predict treatment response. Our data showed that 4 (66%) patients achieved clinical improvement (3 complete responses, 1 partial response), 1 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease. This was a retrospective study consisting of 6 patients. A prospective study with a larger sample size would be desirable for future studies.

Cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma with central nervous system involvement: report of a rarity with review of literature.,Journal of cutaneous pathology,J. Cutan. Pathol.,2014-11-11,"Primary cutaneous gamma-delta (γδ) T-cell lymphoma is an extremely rare and aggressive variant of cutaneous lymphoma. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement, a rare finding, and hemophagocytic syndrome are two complications that are commonly fatal. We describe a 58-year-old patient presenting with skin plaque who subsequently developed subcutaneous nodules diagnosed as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), clinically resembling 'mycosis fungoides'. The patient was treated with repeat topical radiation therapies but had frequent relapsed disease. Approximately 4.5 years after, the patient presented with third and sixth cranial nerve palsies and was found to have CNS involvement by lymphoma per positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and a biopsy of foramen magnum. Phenotypically, the tumor cells were CD3(+)/CD4(-)/CD8(-)/CD7(+)/CD5(-)/CD30(-)/TCRαβ(-)/TCRγδ(+). Despite aggressive strategies taken, the patient expired 3 months after the diagnosis of the CNS lesion. A retrospective investigation proved the original CTCL to be γδ T-cell in origin, confirming an indolent cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma with eventual CNS manifestation. We present this case to draw attention to the entity, which can occasionally present with misleading histopathologic and clinical features. In addition, we provide a review of the literature to summarize clinical and pathologic features of the reported similar cases.

Patients were categorized by the Shimoyama classification and stratified into skin-first, skin-second, and skin-uninvolved courses. The study population included 17 skin-first, 8 skin-second, and 29 skin-uninvolved cases. Skin-first patients (6 acute, 1 lymphoma, 4 chronic, 6 smoldering) were overwhelmingly of Caribbean origin (94%).

"Phase 1/2 study of mogamulizumab, a defucosylated anti-CCR4 antibody, in previously treated patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",Blood,Blood,2015-01-20,"This phase 1/2 study evaluated the efficacy of mogamulizumab, a defucosylated, humanized, anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody, in 41 pretreated patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in phase 1 after IV infusion of mogamulizumab (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) once weekly for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week observation. In phase 2, patients were dosed with 1.0 mg/kg mogamulizumab according to the same schedule for the first course followed by infusion every 2 weeks during subsequent courses until disease progression. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (31.0%), chills (23.8%), headache (21.4%), and infusion-related reaction (21.4%); the majority of events were grade 1/2. There were no significant hematologic effects. Among 38 evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 36.8%: 47.1% in Sézary syndrome (n = 17) and 28.6% in mycosis fungoides (n = 21). Eighteen of 19 (94.7%) patients with ≥B1 blood involvement had a response in blood, including 11 complete responses.

The mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus has antitumor activity in vitro and produces tumor responses in patients with relapsed T-cell lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-28,"Everolimus is an oral agent that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This study investigated mTOR pathway activation in T-cell lymphoma (TCL) cell lines and assessed antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory TCL in a phase 2 trial. The mTOR pathway was activated in all 6 TCL cell lines tested and everolimus strongly inhibited malignant T-cell proliferation with minimal cytotoxic effects. Everolimus completely inhibited phosphorylation of ribosomal S6, a raptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) target, without a compensatory activation of the rictor/mTORC2 target Akt (S475). In the clinical trial, 16 patients with relapsed TCL were enrolled and received everolimus 10 mg by mouth daily. Seven patients (44%) had cutaneous (all mycosis fungoides); 4 (25%) had peripheral T cell not otherwise specified; 2 (13%) had anaplastic large cell; and 1 each had extranodal natural killer/T cell, angioimmunoblastic, and precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma types. The overall response rate was 44% (7/16; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20% to 70%). The median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 1.5-6.5) and the median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-44.3). The median duration of response for the 7 responders was 8.5 months (95% CI, 1.0 to not reached).

Although outcomes for most patients with SPTCL are favorable, those with PCGD-TCLs generally have an inferior outcome, and treatment strategies have not been well defined. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to be a potentially curative strategy in aggressive TCLs and in refractory and advanced-stage mycosis fungoides. We sought to analyze the outcomes of HSCT for panniculitic cutaneous TCL. Fourteen patients (4 SPTCL, 10 PCGD-TCL) presented with primarily pannicular T-cell infiltrates. Seven patients underwent allogeneic HSCT from matched-related donors and matched-unrelated donors of which 4 (57%) are alive (1 SPTCL, 3 PCGD-TCL) at 7.8, 6.9, 6.2, and 0.25 years. Two patients underwent autologous HSCT (1 SPTCL, 1 PCGD-TCL) and both are alive at a median follow-up of 1.91 years.

Clin. Oncol.,2015-06-15,"Aurora A kinase (AAK) is upregulated in highly proliferative lymphomas, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Alisertib is a novel oral AAK inhibitor without adverse safety signals in early-phase studies that demonstrated preliminary activity in T-cell lymphoma. This phase II study was conducted to further investigate the efficacy of alisertib in relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTCL). Eligible patients with histologically confirmed relapsed/refractory PTCL or transformed Mycosis fungoides (tMF) received alisertib 50 mg twice a day for 7 days on 21-day cycles. Of 37 eligible patients, the histologic subtypes enrolled included PTCL not otherwise specified (n = 13), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 9), tMF (n = 7), adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (n = 4), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (n = 2), and extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (n = 2). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events in ≥ 5% of patients included neutropenia (32%), anemia (30%), thrombocytopenia (24%), febrile neutropenia (14%), mucositis (11%), and rash (5%). Treatment was discontinued most commonly for disease progression. Among the PTCL subtypes, the overall response rate was 30%, whereas no responses were observed in tMF. Aurora B kinase was more commonly overexpressed than AAK in tumor specimens. Analysis of AAK, Aurora B kinase, MYC, BCL-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ, and Notch1 expression revealed no association with response. Alisertib has antitumor activity in PTCL, including heavily pretreated patients.

Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome.,Dermatologic clinics,Dermatol Clin,2015-07-29,"Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are common types of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Early-stage MF has a favorable prognosis and responds well to skin-directed regimens. Patients with advanced-stage MF, transformed MF, and SS are treated with combined systemic and skin-directed therapies. However, the disease is incurable with standard regimens, and frequent relapses are common.

TCR sequencing facilitates diagnosis and identifies mature T cells as the cell of origin in CTCL.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2015-10-01,"Early diagnosis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is difficult and takes on average 6 years after presentation, in part because the clinical appearance and histopathology of CTCL can resemble that of benign inflammatory skin diseases. Detection of a malignant T cell clone is critical in making the diagnosis of CTCL, but the T cell receptor γ (TCRγ) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in current clinical use detects clones in only a subset of patients. High-throughput TCR sequencing (HTS) detected T cell clones in 46 of 46 CTCL patients, was more sensitive and specific than TCRγ PCR, and successfully discriminated CTCL from benign inflammatory diseases. HTS also accurately assessed responses to therapy and facilitated diagnosis of disease recurrence. In patients with new skin lesions and no involvement of blood by flow cytometry, HTS demonstrated hematogenous spread of small numbers of malignant T cells. Analysis of CTCL TCRγ genes demonstrated that CTCL is a malignancy derived from mature T cells. There was a maximal T cell density in skin in benign inflammatory diseases that was exceeded in CTCL, suggesting that a niche of finite size may exist for benign T cells in skin. Last, immunostaining demonstrated that the malignant T cell clones in mycosis fungoides and leukemic CTCL localized to different anatomic compartments in the skin. In summary, HTS accurately diagnosed CTCL in all stages, discriminated CTCL from benign inflammatory skin diseases, and provided insights into the cell of origin and location of malignant CTCL cells in skin.

Tumor microenvironment in mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2016-01-01,"Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome arise from malignant T cells that reside in skin, and subsequently are capable of circulating between skin, lymph nodes, and blood. The pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause and result in different behaviors of the skin-homing-malignant T cells in different stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are still unknown. It is hypothesized that the skin microenvironment which is composed by various immune cell subsets as well as their spatial distribution and T-cell interaction through different chemokines and cytokines have an important role in the development and pathogenesis of CTCL and will be addressed in this chapter. Recent studies have discovered that malignant T cells in Sézary syndrome are of the central memory T-cell subset, whereas those in mycosis fungoides are nonrecirculating skin-resident effector memory T cells, and have shown a protumorigenic role of mast cells and macrophages in CTCL. In addition, it has been observed that malignant T cells may exhibit features of one of these three distinct phenotypes (forkhead box P3 + regulatory T-cell phenotype, Th2 phenotype, and Th17 phenotype) and are functionally exhausted through an increased expression of certain coinhibitory molecules, such as programmed death-1. All these new findings could assist in the development of novel targeted therapies for CTCL.",Journal Article,1481.0,19.0,Mycosis fungoides Sézary syndrome arise malignant reside skin subsequently capable circulating skin lymph nodes blood pathophysiologic mechanisms cause different behaviors skin-homing-malignant different stages cutaneous T-cell lymphoma CTCL unknown hypothesized skin microenvironment composed immune subsets spatial distribution T-cell interaction different chemokines cytokines important role development pathogenesis CTCL addressed chapter Recent studies discovered malignant Sézary syndrome central memory T-cell subset mycosis fungoides nonrecirculating skin-resident effector memory shown protumorigenic role mast macrophages CTCL addition observed malignant exhibit features distinct phenotypes forkhead box P3 regulatory T-cell phenotype Th2 phenotype Th17 phenotype functionally exhausted increased expression certain coinhibitory molecules programmed death-1 new findings assist development novel targeted therapies CTCL,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6789, 6744, 2, 9939, 681, 3043, 29, 393, 102, 37, 17, 10114, 4, 2, 1611, 32, 2787, 1, 1033, 59, 263, 502, 2, 315, 3, 11575, 483, 17, 708, 2, 757, 4, 338, 3704, 1, 3, 6290, 5515, 393, 102, 37, 4, 338, 1153, 1, 1486, 102, 31, 4742, 32, 1234, 860, 192, 16, 1237, 17, 3, 995, 92, 16, 3317, 20, 747, 250, 31, 1890, 22, 149, 22, 136, 5104, 1395, 2, 102, 31, 915, 298, 338, 4906, 2, 1886, 47, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3, 193, 2, 1384, 1, 4742, 2, 303, 40, 2814, 4, 26, 6366, 435, 94, 47, 2747, 17, 393, 102, 37, 4, 9939, 681, 32, 1, 3, 854, 2407, 102, 31, 697, 547, 135, 4, 6789, 6744, 32, 67266, 6290, 8185, 2070, 2407, 102, 37, 2, 47, 443, 8, 11840, 200, 1, 5563, 37, 2, 2748, 4, 4742, 4, 352, 192, 71, 85, 164, 17, 393, 102, 37, 68, 2239, 404, 1, 104, 1, 46, 169, 834, 2618, 8106, 4971, 9306, 1253, 102, 31, 1005, 8358, 1005, 2, 8482, 1005, 2, 32, 3772, 9584, 298, 35, 101, 55, 1, 1840, 10928, 1598, 225, 22, 1846, 273, 14, 62, 46, 217, 272, 359, 3425, 4, 3, 193, 1, 229, 238, 235, 9, 4742]",1329.0,26632770,microenvironment mycosis fungoides Sézary syndrome,0,0.0

Nivolumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancy: Preliminary Results of a Phase Ib Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-06-06,"Cancer cells can exploit the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway to avoid immune surveillance by modulating T-lymphocyte activity. In part, this may occur through overexpression of PD-1 and PD-1 pathway ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in the tumor microenvironment. PD-1 blockade has produced significant antitumor activity in solid tumors, and similar evidence has emerged in hematologic malignancies. In this phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort-expansion study, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma received the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab at doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and to assess PD-L1/PD-L2 locus integrity and protein expression. Eighty-one patients were treated (follicular lymphoma, n = 10; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, n = 11; other B-cell lymphomas, n = 10; mycosis fungoides, n = 13; peripheral T-cell lymphoma, n = 5; other T-cell lymphomas, n = 5; multiple myeloma, n = 27). Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 12) prior systemic treatments. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 51 (63%) patients, and most were grade 1 or 2. Objective response rates were 40%, 36%, 15%, and 40% among patients with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, respectively.

Evaluation of O6-Benzylguanine-Potentiated Topical Carmustine for Mycosis Fungoides: A Phase 1-2 Clinical Trial.,JAMA dermatology,JAMA Dermatol,2017-05-01,"In a phase 1 trial, single-dose O6-benzylguanine with topical carmustine for patients with early stage (stage IA through stage IIA) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (MF) type, resulted in clinical responses proportional to inhibition of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity, but a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. To determine whether dose escalation of carmustine in combination with dual-dose O6-benzylguanine to prolong alkyltransferase inhibition could reach an MTD. A single-arm, phase 1-2 clinical trial conducted at a university teaching hospital enrolled 17 adults with stage IA through stage IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, MF type, to evaluate treatment using topical carmustine plus 2 subsequent daily doses of intravenous O6-benzylguanine, administered every 2 weeks for up to 24 weeks (12 cycles). All patients who received treatment were included in an intent-to-treat analysis of the response rate. The study was conducted from February 17, 2010, to April 8, 2014. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2014, to December 1, 2015. Topical carmustine and intravenous O6-benzylguanine. Clinical disease response was assessed by the Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (score range, 0-400; higher score indicates worse disease). Safety data were acquired by review of adverse events at study visits. Of the 17 patients enrolled, 12 (71%) were men; mean (SD) age was 45.2 (14.6) years. There were 7 complete responses and 8 partial responses to combination carmustine and O6-benzylguanine treatment. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, with a mean (SD) duration of complete response of 14.43 (6.6) months. The MTD was 20 mg of carmustine applied once in combination with 2 daily doses of 120 mg/m2 of O6-benzylguanine. Most adverse events (112 [67%]) were grade I. Of 15 patients with dermatitis, 5 individuals (33%) demonstrated grade II dermatitis that was unresponsive to topical corticosteroid therapy. The dermatitis was characterized by high levels of macrophage activation, and clearance was associated with vitamin D3 administration. Compared with single-dose O6-benzylguanine and carmustine, dual-dose O6-benzylguanine resulted in higher overall response rates and reduced total carmustine doses but was associated with more cutaneous adverse events. The MTD for dual-dose O6-benzylguanine plus carmustine was also ascertained. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00961220.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",995.0,2.0,phase 1 trial single-dose O6-benzylguanine topical carmustine patients early stage stage IA stage IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma mycosis fungoides MF type resulted clinical responses proportional inhibition O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase activity maximum tolerated dose MTD reached determine dose escalation carmustine combination dual-dose O6-benzylguanine prolong alkyltransferase inhibition reach MTD single-arm phase 1-2 clinical trial conducted university teaching hospital enrolled 17 adults stage IA stage IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma MF type evaluate treatment topical carmustine plus 2 subsequent daily doses intravenous O6-benzylguanine administered 2 weeks 24 weeks 12 cycles patients received treatment included intent-to-treat response rate conducted February 17 2010 April 8 2014 performed 1 2014 December 1 2015 Topical carmustine intravenous O6-benzylguanine Clinical disease response assessed Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool score range 0-400 higher score indicates worse disease Safety acquired review adverse events visits 17 patients enrolled 12 71 men mean SD age 45.2 14.6 years 7 complete responses 8 partial responses combination carmustine O6-benzylguanine treatment overall clinical response rate 88 mean SD duration complete response 14.43 6.6 months MTD 20 mg carmustine applied combination 2 daily doses 120 mg/m2 O6-benzylguanine adverse events 112 67 grade 15 patients dermatitis 5 individuals 33 demonstrated grade II dermatitis unresponsive topical corticosteroid therapy dermatitis characterized high levels macrophage activation clearance associated vitamin D3 administration Compared single-dose O6-benzylguanine carmustine dual-dose O6-benzylguanine resulted higher overall response rates reduced total carmustine doses associated cutaneous adverse events MTD dual-dose O6-benzylguanine plus carmustine ascertained clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT00961220,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 8, 124, 14, 160, 226, 61, 6505, 10054, 5, 5879, 5818, 9, 7, 5, 191, 82, 82, 3302, 298, 82, 4088, 1486, 102, 31, 6789, 6744, 2966, 267, 627, 4, 38, 253, 831, 6, 297, 1, 6505, 13261, 261, 12998, 128, 84, 8, 689, 421, 61, 961, 10, 44, 1300, 6, 223, 317, 61, 1125, 1, 5818, 4, 150, 5, 1828, 61, 6505, 10054, 6, 3615, 12998, 297, 359, 3690, 35, 961, 8, 226, 475, 124, 14, 18, 38, 160, 426, 28, 8, 1652, 6292, 702, 346, 269, 857, 5, 82, 3302, 298, 82, 4088, 1486, 102, 31, 2966, 267, 6, 376, 24, 75, 5879, 5818, 349, 18, 706, 391, 415, 1, 1262, 6505, 10054, 468, 454, 18, 244, 9, 126, 6, 259, 244, 133, 410, 62, 7, 54, 103, 24, 11, 159, 4, 35, 1697, 6, 943, 65, 1, 3, 51, 116, 3, 45, 10, 426, 29, 3010, 269, 1120, 6, 2292, 66, 1409, 74, 65, 10, 173, 29, 68, 14, 1409, 6, 1397, 14, 1483, 5879, 5818, 2, 1262, 6505, 10054, 38, 34, 51, 10, 275, 20, 3, 1702, 2337, 455, 1515, 368, 184, 13, 1524, 142, 368, 2640, 639, 34, 367, 74, 11, 1294, 20, 206, 1, 290, 281, 28, 45, 2690, 1, 3, 269, 7, 346, 133, 792, 11, 325, 313, 1270, 89, 10, 512, 18, 213, 49, 60, 125, 11, 67, 236, 253, 2, 66, 450, 253, 6, 150, 5818, 2, 6505, 10054, 24, 3, 63, 38, 51, 116, 10, 889, 5, 8, 313, 1270, 654, 1, 236, 51, 1, 213, 601, 49, 49, 53, 3, 961, 10, 179, 81, 1, 5818, 1498, 1059, 4, 150, 5, 18, 391, 415, 1, 2031, 81, 821, 1, 6505, 10054, 96, 290, 281, 3726, 598, 11, 88, 70, 1, 167, 7, 5, 5236, 33, 869, 466, 264, 88, 215, 5236, 17, 10, 7244, 6, 5879, 5654, 36, 3, 5236, 10, 765, 20, 64, 148, 1, 2674, 363, 2, 1960, 10, 41, 5, 1610, 6037, 634, 72, 5, 226, 61, 6505, 10054, 2, 5818, 1828, 61, 6505, 10054, 627, 4, 142, 63, 51, 151, 2, 405, 181, 5818, 415, 84, 10, 41, 5, 80, 1486, 290, 281, 3, 961, 9, 1828, 61, 6505, 10054, 349, 5818, 10, 120, 5240, 1252, 1239, 3719, 69900]",2341.0,28199478,Evaluation O6-Benzylguanine-Potentiated Topical Carmustine Mycosis Fungoides Phase 1-2 Clinical Trial,1,0.017857142857142856

Clinical Practice Recommendations on Indication and Timing of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Mature T Cell and NK/T Cell Lymphomas: An International Collaborative Effort on Behalf of the Guidelines Committee of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-08-07,"Recognizing the significant biological and clinical heterogeneity of mature T cell and natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphomas, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation invited experts to develop clinical practice recommendations related to the role of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) and allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) for specific histological subtypes. We used the GRADE methodology to aid in moving from evidence to decision making and ultimately to generating final recommendations. Auto-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended in peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALCL-ALK)-negative, NK/T cell (disseminated), enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Auto-HCT in relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and ALCL-ALK-positive lymphomas. Auto-HCT is also recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALCL-ALK-negative lymphomas if not performed as front-line therapy. Auto-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed) disease is not recommended for any of the histological subtypes discussed. Allo-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended for NK/T cell (disseminated), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; acute and lymphoma type), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Allo-HCT for relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL-ALK-negative, ALCL-ALK-positive, NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), ATLL (acute, lymphoma type, smoldering/chronic), mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (advanced stage IIB-IVB or tumor stage/extracutaneous), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and hepatosplenic lymphoma.

To review our experience with cutaneous lymphoma diagnosed during or after the use of anti-TNF-α therapies. This is a multicenter retrospective study and a literature review. A total of 22 cases, including 20 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) and 2 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, were identified. In the CTCL group, 75% of the patients received an anti-TNF-α agent for a presumed inflammatory skin condition. Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome were the most common subtypes of CTCL diagnosed. Advanced disease (stage IIB to IVA) was commonly seen at time of diagnosis and required aggressive therapy, including stem cell transplant in 3 patients; 2 patients in whom cutaneous B-cell lymphomas was diagnosed had an indolent course. A total of 31 cases were gathered from a literature search. This is a retrospective study.

High-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptor β gene identifies aggressive early-stage mycosis fungoides.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2018-05-01,"Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignancy of skin-tropic memory T cells. Most MF cases present as early stage (stage I A/B, limited to the skin), and these patients typically have a chronic, indolent clinical course. However, a small subset of early-stage cases develop progressive and fatal disease. Because outcomes can be so different, early identification of this high-risk population is an urgent unmet clinical need. We evaluated the use of next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing of the T cell receptor β gene (<i>TCRB</i>) in lesional skin biopsies to predict progression and survival in a discovery cohort of 208 patients with CTCL (177 with MF) from a 15-year longitudinal observational clinical study. We compared these data to the results in an independent validation cohort of 101 CTCL patients (87 with MF). The tumor clone frequency (TCF) in lesional skin, measured by high-throughput sequencing of the <i>TCRB</i> gene, was an independent prognostic factor of both progression-free and overall survival in patients with CTCL and MF in particular. In early-stage patients, a TCF of >25% in the skin was a stronger predictor of progression than any other established prognostic factor (stage IB versus IA, presence of plaques, high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration, large-cell transformation, or age). The TCF therefore may accurately predict disease progression in early-stage MF. Early identification of patients at high risk for progression could help identify candidates who may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before their disease becomes treatment-refractory.",Journal Article,630.0,13.0,Mycosis fungoides MF common cutaneous lymphoma CTCL malignancy skin-tropic memory MF cases present early stage stage A/B limited skin patients typically chronic indolent clinical course small subset early-stage cases develop progressive fatal disease outcomes different early identification high-risk population urgent unmet clinical need evaluated use next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing receptor TCRB /i lesional skin biopsies predict progression survival discovery cohort 208 patients CTCL 177 MF 15-year longitudinal observational clinical compared independent validation cohort 101 CTCL patients 87 MF clone frequency TCF lesional skin measured high-throughput sequencing TCRB /i independent prognostic factor progression-free overall survival patients CTCL MF particular early-stage patients TCF 25 skin stronger predictor progression established prognostic factor stage IB versus IA presence plaques high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration large-cell transformation age TCF accurately predict disease progression early-stage MF Early identification patients high risk progression help identify candidates benefit allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation disease treatment-refractory,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6789, 6744, 2966, 3, 96, 186, 1486, 102, 31, 4742, 16, 8, 710, 1, 6290, 15255, 2407, 102, 37, 96, 2966, 140, 364, 22, 191, 82, 82, 70, 8, 132, 383, 6, 3, 2, 46, 7, 1969, 47, 8, 442, 2316, 38, 906, 137, 8, 302, 697, 1, 191, 82, 140, 690, 1014, 2, 3034, 34, 408, 123, 122, 40, 1743, 338, 191, 911, 1, 26, 64, 43, 266, 16, 35, 5013, 3715, 38, 594, 21, 194, 3, 119, 1, 1305, 914, 64, 3643, 261, 615, 1, 3, 102, 31, 153, 145, 70, 51055, 70, 4, 13795, 1154, 6, 678, 91, 2, 25, 4, 8, 1574, 180, 1, 5920, 7, 5, 4742, 4699, 5, 2966, 29, 8, 167, 111, 2380, 2495, 38, 45, 21, 72, 46, 74, 6, 3, 99, 4, 35, 306, 929, 180, 1, 2338, 4742, 7, 912, 5, 2966, 3, 30, 3910, 675, 8108, 4, 13795, 644, 20, 64, 3643, 615, 1, 3, 70, 51055, 70, 145, 10, 35, 306, 177, 161, 1, 110, 91, 115, 2, 63, 25, 4, 7, 5, 4742, 2, 2966, 4, 1454, 4, 191, 82, 7, 8, 8108, 1, 243, 4, 3, 10, 8, 3355, 980, 1, 91, 76, 500, 127, 635, 177, 161, 82, 3180, 185, 3302, 463, 1, 14505, 64, 315, 3330, 2374, 1227, 375, 31, 1392, 15, 89, 3, 8108, 673, 68, 2141, 678, 34, 91, 4, 191, 82, 2966, 191, 911, 1, 7, 28, 64, 43, 9, 91, 359, 987, 255, 1931, 54, 68, 247, 29, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 348, 136, 34, 5366, 24, 430]",1598.0,29743350,High-throughput sequencing receptor identifies aggressive early-stage mycosis fungoides,1,0.017857142857142856
"Mogamulizumab versus vorinostat in previously treated cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MAVORIC): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-08-09,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas are rare non-Hodgkin lymphomas with substantial morbidity and mortality in advanced disease stages. We compared the efficacy of mogamulizumab, a novel monoclonal antibody directed against C-C chemokine receptor 4, with vorinostat in patients with previously treated cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In this open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome at 61 medical centres in the USA, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, and Australia. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years (in Japan, ≥20 years), had failed (for progression or toxicity as assessed by the principal investigator) at least one previous systemic therapy, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or less and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice web response system to mogamulizumab (1·0 mg/kg intravenously on a weekly basis for the first 28-day cycle, then on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles) or vorinostat (400 mg daily). Stratification was by cutaneous T-cell lymphoma subtype (mycosis fungoides vs Sézary syndrome) and disease stage (IB-II vs III-IV). Since this study was open label, patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population. Patients who received one or more doses of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This study is ongoing, and enrolment is complete. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01728805. Between Dec 12, 2012, and Jan 29, 2016, 372 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive mogamulizumab (n=186) or vorinostat (n=186), comprising the intention-to-treat population. Two patients randomly assigned to mogamulizumab withdrew consent before receiving study treatment; thus, 370 patients were included in the safety population. Mogamulizumab therapy resulted in superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival compared with vorinostat therapy (median 7·7 months [95% CI 5·7-10·3] in the mogamulizumab group vs 3·1 months [2·9-4·1] in the vorinostat group; hazard ratio 0·53, 95% CI 0·41-0·69; stratified log-rank p<0·0001). Grade 3-4 adverse events of any cause were reported in 75 (41%) of 184 patients in the mogamulizumab group and 76 (41%) of 186 patients in the vorinostat group. The most common serious adverse events of any cause were pyrexia in eight (4%) patients and cellulitis in five (3%) patients in the mogamulizumab group; and cellulitis in six (3%) patients, pulmonary embolism in six (3%) patients, and sepsis in five (3%) patients in the vorinostat group. Two (67%) of three on-treatment deaths with mogamulizumab (due to sepsis and polymyositis) and three (33%) of nine on-treatment deaths with vorinostat (two due to pulmonary embolism and one due to bronchopneumonia) were considered treatment-related. Mogamulizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with vorinostat, and could provide a new, effective treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and, importantly, for Sézary syndrome, a subtype that represents a major therapeutic challenge in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Res.,,"Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are the most common subtypes of all primary cutaneous lymphomas and represent complex diseases that require a multidisciplinary assessment by dermatologists, oncologists, and pathologists. Staging and work-up are critical to guarantee an optimal treatment plan that includes skin-directed and/or systemic regimens depending on the clinical stage, tumor burden, drug-related side effect profile, and patient comorbidities. However, there is no cure and patients frequently relapse, requiring repeated treatment courses for disease control.
