MLL translocations specify a distinct gene expression profile that distinguishes a unique leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2001-12-03,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemias carrying a chromosomal translocation involving the mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL, ALL1, HRX) have a particularly poor prognosis. Here we show that they have a characteristic, highly distinct gene expression profile that is consistent with an early hematopoietic progenitor expressing select multilineage markers and individual HOX genes. Clustering algorithms reveal that lymphoblastic leukemias with MLL translocations can clearly be separated from conventional acute lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous leukemias. We propose that they constitute a distinct disease, denoted here as MLL, and show that the differences in gene expression are robust enough to classify leukemias correctly as MLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia. Establishing that MLL is a unique entity is critical, as it mandates the examination of selectively expressed genes for urgently needed molecular targets.",Comparative Study,6623.0,1410.0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemias carrying chromosomal translocation involving mixed-lineage leukemia MLL ALL1 HRX particularly poor prognosis characteristic highly distinct expression profile consistent early hematopoietic progenitor expressing select multilineage markers individual HOX Clustering algorithms reveal lymphoblastic leukemias MLL translocations clearly separated conventional acute lymphoblastic acute myelogenous leukemias propose constitute distinct disease denoted MLL differences expression robust classify leukemias correctly MLL acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia Establishing MLL unique entity critical mandates examination selectively expressed urgently needed molecular targets,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 1275, 2792, 2934, 8, 1860, 2006, 1267, 3, 1739, 2542, 145, 3049, 30178, 52667, 47, 8, 823, 334, 356, 467, 21, 514, 17, 491, 47, 8, 2037, 561, 834, 145, 55, 800, 17, 16, 925, 5, 35, 191, 1007, 2520, 1046, 1717, 12471, 525, 2, 797, 14722, 214, 3147, 3529, 2396, 17, 1275, 2792, 5, 3049, 3262, 122, 2536, 40, 4910, 29, 809, 286, 1275, 2, 286, 2194, 2792, 21, 2548, 17, 491, 4999, 8, 834, 34, 16175, 467, 22, 3049, 2, 514, 17, 3, 362, 4, 145, 55, 32, 1922, 5151, 6, 4896, 2792, 4911, 22, 3049, 286, 1275, 15, 286, 2194, 4431, 17, 3049, 16, 8, 991, 2983, 16, 740, 22, 192, 16176, 3, 1385, 1, 2382, 570, 214, 9, 5354, 575, 219, 637]",902.0,11731795,MLL translocations specify distinct expression profile distinguishes unique leukemia,0,0.0
HPLC determination of thiopurine nucleosides and nucleotides in vivo in lymphoblasts following mercaptopurine therapy.,Clinical chemistry,Clin. Chem.,2002-01-01,"Mercaptopurine is a prodrug requiring intracellular activation to thiopurine nucleotides to exert antileukemic effect. We developed a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic assay for the quantification of mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and methylmercaptopurine nucleoside and nucleotide concentrations in the target tissue, the leukemic lymphoblast. Leukemic blasts were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow by a standard Ficoll-hypaque procedure. Proteins were removed by ultrafiltration in the presence of dithiothreitol. Thiopurine ribonucleotides were converted into their respective ribonucleosides by treatment of ultrafiltrate with acid phosphatase. Thiopurine nucleosides and bases were measured by direct injection of ultrafiltrate into the chromatographic system. Thiopurine nucleotide concentrations were calculated by subtracting the thiopurine nucleoside concentrations measured after treatment with acid phosphatase from those measured after direct injection of ultrafiltrate in the chromatographic system. Analytes were separated on a C18 Supelco column with ammonium phosphate-methanol eluent coupled with ultraviolet detection. CVs for intra- and interday precision were 1.1-14% (median, 4.9%), and recovery of added analyte was 89-126% (median, 105%) at low and high concentrations of analytes, except for mercaptopurine riboside. The median signal for each of the five metabolites in lymphoblast samples was 98% (range, 80-106%) of that in water. Detection limits for thiopurine bases and nucleosides ranged from 0.5 to 4.5 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells.

Clin. Oncol.,2002-01-01,"To improve efficacy and reduce toxicity of treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients from all risk groups, including infants and those with T-cell disease, were treated between 1987 and 1991. Standard-risk (SR) patients did not receive cranial irradiation, whereas high-risk (HR) and very high-risk (VHR) patients participated in a randomized comparison of 18 Gy of cranial irradiation conventionally fractionated versus two fractions per day (hyperfractionated). At a median follow-up of 9.2 years, the 9-year event-free survival (EFS +/- SE) was 75% +/- 2% for all 369 patients, 77% +/- 4% for the 142 SR patients, and 73% +/- 3% for the 227 HR/VHR patients (P =.37 comparing SR and HR/VHR). The CNS, with or without concomitant bone marrow involvement, was the first site of relapse in 19 (13%) of the 142 SR patients: 16 (20%) of 79 SR boys and three (5%) of 63 SR girls. This high incidence of relapses necessitated a recall of SR boys for additional therapy. CNS relapse occurred in only two (1%) of 227 HR and VHR patients. There were no outcome differences found among randomized treatment groups. Nine-year overall survival was 84% +/- 2% for the entire population, 93% +/- 2% for SR children, and 79% +/- 3% for HR and VHR children (P <.01 comparing SR and HR/VHR). A high overall survival outcome was obtained for SR patients despite the high risk of CNS relapse for SR boys, which was presumed to be associated with eliminating cranial radiation without intensifying systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy.

Effect of tolerance to noninherited maternal antigens on the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation from a parent or an HLA-haploidentical sibling.,Blood,Blood,2002-03-01,"In haploidentical transplantation, the mismatched haplotype of the donor can originate from either of the parents. We refer to such mismatched haplotypes as noninherited maternal antigens (NIMA haplotype) or noninherited paternal antigens (NIPA haplotype). To determine whether exposure to maternal HLA antigens benefits patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, we analyzed graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantations from parental or haploidentical sibling donors. We studied 269 patients receiving 1 or 2 HLA-A, -B, -DR antigen-mismatched sibling or parental non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplants for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myelogenous leukemia between 1985 and 1997 that were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. Included were 121 (45%) NIMA-mismatched and 148 (55%) NIPA-mismatched transplantations. Sixty-three (52%) of the NIMA-mismatched transplants and 69 (47%) of the NIPA-mismatched transplants were from haploidentical sibling donors. Sibling transplantations mismatched for NIMA had similar rates of graft failure but lower rates of acute GVHD (P <.02) than NIPA-mismatched sibling transplantations. In the first 4 months after transplantation, mother-to-child transplantations involved significantly less chronic GVHD than father-to-child transplantations (P <.02). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was significantly higher after parental transplantations (P =.009 for mother; P =.03 for father) than after haploidentical sibling transplantations mismatched for the NIMA. Non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplants donated by haploidentical siblings to recipients mismatched for NIPA and transplants donated by parents caused more acute and chronic GVHD and TRM than transplants donated by haploidentical siblings mismatched for NIMA.",Comparative Study,6535.0,217.0,haploidentical transplantation mismatched haplotype donor originate parents refer mismatched haplotypes noninherited maternal antigens NIMA haplotype noninherited paternal antigens NIPA haplotype determine exposure maternal HLA antigens benefits patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation graft failure graft-versus-host disease GVHD transplantations parental haploidentical sibling donors studied 269 patients receiving 1 2 HLA-A -B -DR antigen-mismatched sibling parental non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplants acute myelogenous leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia 1985 1997 reported International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry Included 121 45 NIMA-mismatched 148 55 NIPA-mismatched transplantations Sixty-three 52 NIMA-mismatched transplants 69 47 NIPA-mismatched transplants haploidentical sibling donors Sibling transplantations mismatched NIMA similar rates graft failure lower rates acute GVHD P .02 NIPA-mismatched sibling transplantations 4 months transplantation mother-to-child transplantations involved significantly chronic GVHD father-to-child transplantations P .02 Treatment-related mortality TRM significantly higher parental transplantations P =.009 mother P =.03 father haploidentical sibling transplantations mismatched NIMA Non-T-cell-depleted bone marrow transplants donated haploidentical siblings recipients mismatched NIPA transplants donated parents caused acute chronic GVHD TRM transplants donated haploidentical siblings mismatched NIMA,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 5802, 497, 3, 5095, 4179, 1, 3, 1488, 122, 8838, 29, 361, 1, 3, 2418, 21, 7851, 6, 225, 5095, 5940, 22, 30205, 6039, 1575, 16624, 4179, 15, 30205, 10649, 1575, 30206, 4179, 6, 223, 317, 645, 6, 6039, 1160, 1575, 1141, 7, 479, 581, 497, 21, 311, 1599, 496, 2, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 50, 6779, 29, 3418, 15, 5802, 3684, 2344, 21, 656, 8639, 7, 357, 14, 15, 18, 1160, 8, 132, 3436, 448, 5095, 3684, 15, 3418, 220, 102, 31, 4358, 581, 4016, 9, 286, 2194, 286, 1275, 15, 442, 2194, 59, 4675, 2, 2341, 17, 11, 210, 6, 3, 944, 581, 941, 1608, 159, 11, 4141, 512, 16624, 5095, 2, 4647, 614, 30206, 5095, 6779, 1746, 169, 653, 1, 3, 16624, 5095, 4016, 2, 790, 662, 1, 3, 30206, 5095, 4016, 11, 29, 5802, 3684, 2344, 3684, 6779, 5095, 9, 16624, 42, 288, 151, 1, 1599, 496, 84, 280, 151, 1, 286, 1562, 19, 588, 76, 30206, 5095, 3684, 6779, 4, 3, 157, 39, 53, 50, 497, 9733, 6, 2566, 6779, 646, 97, 299, 442, 1562, 76, 17610, 6, 2566, 6779, 19, 588, 24, 139, 282, 5064, 10, 97, 142, 50, 3418, 6779, 19, 2376, 9, 9733, 19, 680, 9, 17610, 76, 50, 5802, 3684, 6779, 5095, 9, 3, 16624, 220, 102, 31, 4358, 581, 4016, 25982, 20, 5802, 2758, 6, 2190, 5095, 9, 30206, 2, 4016, 25982, 20, 2418, 1546, 80, 286, 2, 442, 1562, 2, 5064, 76, 4016, 25982, 20, 5802, 2758, 5095, 9, 16624]",1772.0,11861270,Effect tolerance noninherited maternal antigens occurrence graft-versus-host disease bone marrow transplantation parent HLA-haploidentical sibling,0,0.0
Diagnostic X-rays and ultrasound exposure and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia by immunophenotype.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2002-02-01,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between in utero diagnostic X-rays and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the less well-studied relationship of this malignancy to preconception and postnatal diagnostic X-rays or fetal ultrasound exposures. The Children's Cancer Group conducted a case-control study including interviews with parents of 1842 ALL cases diagnosed under the age of 15 years and 1986 individually matched controls. Associations of self-reported parental preconception, in utero, and postnatal X-ray exposure with risk of childhood ALL were examined using odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from logistic regression models among the overall group of ALL cases as well as immunophenotypic and age-specific subgroups. Overall, in utero pelvimetric diagnostic X-rays were not associated with the risk of pediatric ALL (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7). Childhood ALL, all types combined (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) and specific types were also not linked with postnatal diagnostic X-ray exposures. Neither maternal (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) nor paternal (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4) lower abdominal preconception diagnostic X-rays were associated with risk of childhood ALL. Among the multiple comparisons for age-, sex-, and subtype-specific subgroups, we observed an elevated risk of total ALL among children ages 11-14 at diagnosis (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0) in relation to in utero pelvimetric diagnostic X-ray exposures and a small increase in pre-B ALL for all ages combined (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7) in relation to postnatal diagnostic X-rays. In utero diagnostic ultrasound tests were not linked with risk of childhood ALL. We found little consistent evidence that in utero diagnostic ultrasound tests or X-rays were linked with an increased risk of childhood ALL. Small increases in total or pre-B ALL risks for children in selected age groups to very low ionizing radiation exposures from postnatal or preconception diagnostic X-ray exposures may represent chance findings or biases.

Genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1/RUNX1 and ETO cluster with topoisomerase II DNA cleavage and DNase I hypersensitive sites in t(8;21) leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2002-02-26,"The translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) is one of the most frequent chromosome translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML1/RUNX1 at 21q22 is involved in t(8;21), t(3;21), and t(16;21) in de novo and therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome as well as in t(12;21) in childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO (at 8q22) cluster in a few introns, the mechanisms of DNA recombination resulting in t(8;21) are unknown. The correlation of specific chromatin structural elements, i.e., topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and scaffold-associated regions, which have been implicated in chromosome recombination with genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO in t(8;21) is unknown. The breakpoints in AML1 and ETO were clustered in the Kasumi 1 cell line and in 31 leukemia patients with t(8;21); all except one had de novo AML. Sequencing of the breakpoint junctions revealed no common DNA motif; however, deletions, duplications, microhomologies, and nontemplate DNA were found. Ten in vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites were mapped in AML1, including three in intron 5 and seven in intron 7a, and two were in intron 1b of ETO. All strong topo II sites colocalized with DNase I hypersensitive sites and thus represent open chromatin regions. These sites correlated with genomic DNA breakpoints in both AML1 and ETO, thus implicating them in the de novo 8;21 translocation.",Journal Article,6538.0,86.0,translocation 8 21 q22 q22 frequent chromosome translocations acute myeloid leukemia AML AML1/RUNX1 21q22 involved 8 21 3 21 16 21 novo therapy-related AML myelodysplastic syndrome 12 21 childhood B acute lymphoblastic leukemia DNA breakpoints AML1 ETO 8q22 cluster introns mechanisms DNA recombination resulting 8 21 unknown correlation specific chromatin structural elements i.e. topoisomerase II topo II DNA cleavage sites DNase hypersensitive sites scaffold-associated regions implicated chromosome recombination genomic DNA breakpoints AML1 ETO 8 21 unknown breakpoints AML1 ETO clustered Kasumi 1 line 31 leukemia patients 8 21 novo AML Sequencing breakpoint junctions revealed common DNA motif deletions duplications microhomologies nontemplate DNA vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites mapped AML1 including intron 5 seven intron 7a intron 1b ETO strong topo II sites colocalized DNase hypersensitive sites represent open chromatin regions sites correlated genomic DNA breakpoints AML1 ETO implicating novo 8 21 translocation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2006, 102, 66, 239, 8026, 8026, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 908, 1170, 3262, 4, 286, 533, 329, 6535, 6092, 28, 14402, 16, 646, 4, 102, 66, 239, 102, 27, 239, 2, 102, 245, 239, 4, 1566, 2018, 2, 36, 139, 329, 2, 681, 22, 149, 22, 4, 102, 133, 239, 4, 864, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 242, 261, 7843, 4, 6535, 2, 8566, 28, 42858, 3132, 4, 8, 1021, 12491, 3, 483, 1, 261, 4017, 1113, 4, 102, 66, 239, 32, 860, 3, 816, 1, 112, 2287, 3281, 2531, 70, 563, 3999, 215, 7852, 215, 261, 3155, 633, 21951, 70, 14077, 633, 2, 11547, 41, 1374, 92, 47, 85, 1771, 4, 1170, 4017, 5, 572, 261, 7843, 4, 6535, 2, 8566, 4, 102, 66, 239, 16, 860, 3, 7843, 4, 6535, 2, 8566, 11, 6464, 4, 3, 18159, 14, 31, 328, 2, 4, 456, 7, 5, 102, 66, 239, 62, 2187, 104, 42, 1566, 2018, 329, 615, 1, 3, 8567, 10262, 553, 77, 186, 261, 5298, 137, 2439, 8910, 52765, 2, 52766, 261, 11, 204, 1618, 4, 386, 7852, 215, 261, 3155, 633, 11, 6224, 4, 6535, 141, 169, 4, 6259, 33, 2, 648, 4, 6259, 8730, 2, 100, 11, 4, 6259, 4693, 1, 8566, 62, 1082, 7852, 215, 633, 16625, 5, 21951, 70, 14077, 633, 2, 631, 1231, 1020, 2287, 1374, 46, 633, 438, 5, 572, 261, 7843, 4, 110, 6535, 2, 8566, 631, 7912, 1370, 4, 3, 1566, 2018, 66, 239, 2006]",1375.0,11867721,Genomic DNA breakpoints AML1/RUNX1 ETO cluster topoisomerase II DNA cleavage DNase hypersensitive sites 8 21 leukemia,41,0.04480874316939891

Doxorubicin administration by continuous infusion is not cardioprotective: the Dana-Farber 91-01 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia protocol.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-03-01,"Acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity can be prevented in adults by continuous infusion of the drug, but mechanisms of cardiotoxicity are different in children. We compared cardiac outcomes in children receiving bolus or continuous infusion of doxorubicin. In a randomized study, children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia received doxorubicin 360 mg/m(2) in 30-mg/m(2) doses every 3 weeks either by bolus (within 1 hour, n = 57) or by continuous infusion (over 48 hours, n = 64). Echocardiograms obtained before doxorubicin and at longest follow-up times were centrally remeasured, and z scores of cardiac measurements were calculated based on a healthy population. The groups were similar in age, sex distribution, doxorubicin dose, and duration of follow-up. Before treatment, measures of left ventricular (LV) structure and function did not reveal dilated cardiomyopathy and were not statistically different between bolus and continuous-infusion groups. The follow-up echocardiograms demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups for any cardiac characteristic, but both groups showed significant abnormalities of LV structure and function compared with normal and with baseline. For example, the mean LV fractional shortening fell by approximately two SD in both groups between the two echocardiograms. LV contractility was depressed in both groups (for bolus patients, median z score = -0.70 SD, P =.006; for continuous-infusion patients, median z score = -0.765, P =.005). Dilated cardiomyopathy and inadequate LV hypertrophy were noted in both groups. Clinical cardiac manifestations and event-free survival did not differ.

"Birth characteristics, maternal reproductive history, hormone use during pregnancy, and risk of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia by immunophenotype (United States).",Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2002-02-01,"To investigate the associations of birth characteristics and maternal reproductive factors with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by immunophenotypic subtypes. Data collected from a case-control study including 1842 ALL cases (age < 15 years) and 1986 individually matched controls were analyzed. Exposure information was obtained through telephone interviews of parents. Factors associated with risk of ALL from all subgroups combined included high birth weight (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8), high birth order (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.3-3.0 for fourth-born child compared to first-born child). young maternal age (<20 compared to 25-29, OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), advanced paternal age (>39 compared to 25-29, OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9), induced abortion prior to the index pregnancy (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0-1.4), and oral contraceptive use during the index pregnancy (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.2) with children under the age of 2 (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.0-24.7) being the predominantly affected group. Risk of early pre-B-cell ALL increased with advanced paternal age (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.7) and high birth order (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.6), while risk of pre-B-cell ALL increased with both younger (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.4-8.4) and advanced maternal age (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.9). T-cell ALL was associated with high birth weight (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1-5.5) and history of induced abortion (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.3-4.5). This study suggests that the association of ALL with birth characteristics and maternal reproductive factors varies with the immunophenotype of the ALL.

CD56 expression predicts occurrence of CNS disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2002-07-01,"We examined the pre-treatment bone marrow samples from 200 consecutive adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on various protocols at the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1986 and 1998. Standard MFC techniques were used to determine CD56 expression on the leukemia blasts cells. The expression of CD56 was correlated with clinical characteristics at diagnosis, response to therapy, survival and disease-free survival. Blast expression of CD56 (> or = 20% of leukemic blasts) was seen in 16 (8%) of patients, with a median expression of 67% (range 20-99%). CD56 expression was associated with a higher incidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis (19% versus 4%; P=0.016). Incidence of CNS disease at any time was higher in patients with CD56+ disease (31% versus 14%; P=0.057). Among the 109 patients uniformly treated with the hyperCVAD regimen, CD56 expression was associated with a statistically significant higher incidence of CNS disease (33% versus 9%; P=0.026). CD56 expression in ALL is uncommon but may predict a higher risk for CNS disease. If these results are confirmed, CD56 expression could be used in combination with other high-risk features (e.g. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), S-phase fraction, mature B-cell phenotype) to design a risk-oriented approach to CNS prophylaxis.",Journal Article,6413.0,37.0,examined pre-treatment bone marrow 200 consecutive adult patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated protocols University Texas M.D Anderson Center 1986 1998 Standard MFC techniques determine CD56 expression leukemia blasts expression CD56 correlated clinical characteristics diagnosis response therapy survival disease-free survival Blast expression CD56 20 leukemic blasts seen 16 8 patients median expression 67 range 20-99 CD56 expression associated higher incidence central nervous CNS disease diagnosis 19 versus 4 P=0.016 Incidence CNS disease time higher patients CD56+ disease 31 versus 14 P=0.057 109 patients uniformly treated hyperCVAD regimen CD56 expression associated statistically significant higher incidence CNS disease 33 versus 9 P=0.026 CD56 expression uncommon predict higher risk CNS disease confirmed CD56 expression combination high-risk features e.g lactate dehydrogenase LDH S-phase fraction mature B-cell phenotype design risk-oriented approach CNS prophylaxis,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 409, 3, 671, 24, 581, 347, 29, 1250, 935, 780, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 73, 23, 747, 2189, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 188, 427, 1929, 12, 574, 59, 3751, 2, 1850, 260, 9439, 1092, 11, 95, 6, 223, 5803, 55, 23, 3, 2438, 37, 3, 55, 1, 5803, 10, 438, 5, 38, 374, 28, 147, 51, 6, 36, 25, 2, 34, 115, 25, 3112, 55, 1, 5803, 15, 179, 1, 2015, 2438, 10, 527, 4, 245, 66, 1, 7, 5, 8, 52, 55, 1, 598, 184, 179, 1058, 5803, 55, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 287, 1, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 34, 28, 147, 326, 185, 39, 19, 13, 3820, 287, 1, 1025, 34, 28, 500, 98, 10, 142, 4, 7, 5, 5803, 34, 456, 185, 213, 19, 13, 10807, 107, 3, 3486, 7, 4254, 73, 5, 3, 13792, 477, 5803, 55, 10, 41, 5, 8, 712, 93, 142, 287, 1, 1025, 34, 466, 185, 83, 19, 13, 4554, 5803, 55, 4, 62, 16, 2052, 84, 68, 678, 8, 142, 43, 9, 1025, 34, 492, 46, 99, 32, 557, 5803, 55, 359, 40, 95, 4, 150, 5, 127, 64, 43, 404, 563, 499, 3330, 2374, 4592, 695, 124, 1509, 2908, 132, 31, 1005, 6, 771, 8, 43, 8095, 353, 6, 1025, 2049]",1277.0,12008081,CD56 expression predicts occurrence CNS disease acute lymphoblastic leukemia,18,0.019672131147540985
Autologous versus allogeneic unrelated donor transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: comparative toxicity and outcomes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2002-01-01,"For patients with high-risk or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lacking a related histocompatible donor, autologous (Auto) and unrelated donor (URD) transplantation are available options. We compared outcomes and toxicities in 712 patients with ALL (517 URD, 195 Auto) in first complete remission (CR1) or second complete remission (CR2) who underwent transplantation. All patients were <50 years old, although URD patientswere younger (median age, 14 versus 18 years, P < .002). The proportion of patients in CR1 versus CR2 was similar (36% versus 38%, P = .57), but more URD recipients than Auto recipients had high-risk karyotypes (25% versus 13%, P = .003) and white blood cell (WBC) counts > or =50 x 10(9)/L (33% versus 14%, P < .001). Engraftment was similar in URD and Auto recipients. Ex vivo purging delayed but did not prevent engraftment after Auto transplantation. Transplantation-related mortality was higher after URD transplantation (42%+/-8%) than after Auto transplantation (20%+/-12%) in CR1 (P = .004) and also in CR2. Conversely, relapse was more frequent after Auto transplantation in CR1 (Auto, 49%+/-12% versus URD, 14%+/-5%) and CR2 (64%+/-8% versus 25%+/-5%) (P < .0001). These findings showed net similar outcomes for these 2 transplantation choices. Transplantation in CR1 yielded similar 3-year survival rates for URD (51%+/-7%) and Auto (44%+/-12%), as did transplantation in CR2 (40%+/-6% versus 32%+/-9%, respectively). Multivariate regression analysis identified significantly better disease-free survival after the first 6 months in matched URD versus Auto in younger patients, in those in CR2 with CR1 >1year, WBC <50 x 10(9)/L, performance status > or =90%, and in those who have undergone transplantation since 1995. These comparative data suggest that both matched URD and Auto transplantation can yield extended survival.

Radiation myelitis in a 5-year-old girl.,Journal of child neurology,J. Child Neurol.,2002-03-01,"Myelopathy is an uncommon complication of radiotherapy, particularly in the pediatric age group. A 5-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed a severe but transient radiculopathy after intrathecal administration of methotrexate and cytarabine for an isolated central nervous system relapse. Chemotherapy was then given through an intraventricular catheter. Owing to a second central nervous system recurrence, she was treated with craniospinal radiation. The whole brain down to the level of C2 received a dose of 2400 cGy. Two months after completion of radiation, the child developed a progressive tetraparesis, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing lesion involving the medulla and upper cervical cord. A biopsy was consistent with a treatment-related necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. This case suggests that patients who develop neurologic dysfunction when treated with methotrexate can also be particularly susceptible to radiation-related injury.",Case Reports,6535.0,8.0,Myelopathy uncommon complication radiotherapy particularly pediatric age group 5-year-old girl acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed severe transient radiculopathy intrathecal administration methotrexate cytarabine isolated central nervous relapse Chemotherapy given intraventricular catheter Owing second central nervous recurrence treated craniospinal radiation brain level C2 received dose 2400 cGy months completion radiation child developed progressive tetraparesis magnetic resonance imaging revealed enhancing lesion involving medulla upper cervical cord biopsy consistent treatment-related necrotizing leukoencephalopathy case suggests patients develop neurologic dysfunction treated methotrexate particularly susceptible radiation-related injury,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[10415, 16, 35, 2052, 1447, 1, 310, 823, 4, 3, 815, 89, 87, 8, 33, 111, 1095, 12079, 5, 286, 1275, 276, 8, 905, 84, 2473, 16642, 50, 5126, 634, 1, 2116, 2, 1855, 9, 35, 1355, 854, 1880, 398, 429, 56, 10, 818, 447, 298, 35, 7199, 3925, 3421, 6, 8, 419, 854, 1880, 398, 146, 3109, 10, 73, 5, 5748, 121, 3, 902, 342, 1328, 6, 3, 301, 1, 6706, 103, 8, 61, 1, 12518, 3071, 100, 53, 50, 1438, 1, 121, 3, 2566, 276, 8, 1014, 52917, 2, 1484, 1535, 270, 553, 35, 2430, 1180, 1267, 3, 20187, 2, 1726, 1885, 8, 411, 10, 925, 5, 8, 24, 139, 21974, 8744, 26, 473, 844, 17, 7, 54, 690, 2543, 1527, 198, 73, 5, 2116, 122, 120, 40, 823, 4012, 6, 121, 139, 2730]",954.0,12026238,Radiation myelitis 5-year-old girl,0,0.0
Low incidence of second neoplasms among children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after 1983.,Blood,Blood,2002-06-01,"Second malignant neoplasms are a serious complication after successful treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With improvement in survival, it is important to assess the impact of contemporary risk-based therapies on second neoplasms in ALL survivors. A cohort of 8831 children diagnosed with ALL and enrolled on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols between 1983 and 1995 were observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors. The median age at diagnosis of ALL was 4.7 years. The cohort had accrued 54 883 person-years of follow-up. Sixty-three patients developed second neoplasms, including solid, nonhematopoietic tumors (n = 39: brain tumors n = 19, other solid tumors n = 20), myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia (n = 16), and lymphoma (n = 8). The cumulative incidence of any second neoplasm was 1.18% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 0.8%-1.5%), representing a 7.2-fold increased risk compared with the general population. The risk was increased significantly for acute myeloid leukemia (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 52.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 8.3), parotid gland tumors (SIR 33.4), thyroid cancer (SIR 13.3), brain tumors (SIR 10.1), and soft tissue sarcoma (SIR 9.1). Multivariate analysis revealed female sex (relative risk [RR] 1.8), radiation to the craniospinal axis (RR 1.6), and relapse of primary disease (RR 3.5) to be independently associated with increased risk of all second neoplasms. Risk of second neoplasms increased with radiation dose (1800 cGy RR 1.5; 2400 cGy RR 3.9). Actuarial survival at 10 years from diagnosis of second neoplasms was 39%. Follow-up of this large cohort that was treated with contemporary risk-based therapy showed that the incidence of second neoplasms remains low after diagnosis of childhood ALL.",Clinical Trial,6443.0,159.0,Second malignant neoplasms complication successful treatment childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia improvement survival important assess impact contemporary risk-based therapies second neoplasms survivors cohort 8831 children diagnosed enrolled Children 's Group therapeutic protocols 1983 1995 observed determine incidence second neoplasms associated risk factors median age diagnosis 4.7 years cohort accrued 54 883 person-years follow-up Sixty-three patients developed second neoplasms including solid nonhematopoietic n 39 brain n 19 solid n 20 myeloid leukemia myelodysplasia n 16 lymphoma n 8 cumulative incidence second neoplasm 1.18 10 years 95 confidence interval 0.8 -1.5 representing 7.2-fold increased risk compared general population risk increased significantly acute myeloid leukemia standardized incidence ratio SIR 52.3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma SIR 8.3 parotid gland SIR 33.4 thyroid SIR 13.3 brain SIR 10.1 soft tissue sarcoma SIR 9.1 Multivariate revealed female sex relative risk RR 1.8 radiation craniospinal axis RR 1.6 relapse primary disease RR 3.5 independently associated increased risk second neoplasms Risk second neoplasms increased radiation dose 1800 cGy RR 1.5 2400 cGy RR 3.9 Actuarial survival 10 years diagnosis second neoplasms 39 Follow-up large cohort treated contemporary risk-based therapy showed incidence second neoplasms remains low diagnosis childhood,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[419, 393, 1179, 32, 8, 1762, 1447, 50, 1401, 24, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 5, 767, 4, 25, 192, 16, 305, 6, 423, 3, 345, 1, 2667, 43, 90, 235, 23, 419, 1179, 4, 62, 332, 8, 180, 1, 52933, 541, 265, 5, 62, 2, 346, 23, 541, 292, 12, 87, 189, 2189, 59, 6656, 2, 2323, 11, 164, 6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 419, 1179, 2, 41, 43, 130, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 62, 10, 39, 67, 60, 3, 180, 42, 3198, 667, 14748, 2719, 60, 1, 166, 126, 1746, 169, 7, 276, 419, 1179, 141, 537, 19463, 57, 78, 587, 342, 57, 78, 326, 127, 537, 57, 78, 179, 533, 15, 6128, 78, 245, 2, 78, 66, 3, 967, 287, 1, 500, 419, 2131, 10, 14, 203, 28, 79, 60, 48, 307, 268, 13, 66, 14, 33, 2861, 8, 67, 18, 1116, 101, 43, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 266, 3, 43, 10, 101, 97, 9, 286, 533, 1670, 287, 197, 3636, 653, 27, 3636, 66, 27, 5838, 2326, 57, 3636, 466, 39, 12, 3636, 233, 27, 342, 57, 3636, 79, 14, 2, 1214, 246, 3636, 83, 14, 331, 65, 553, 1061, 1035, 580, 43, 861, 14, 66, 121, 6, 3, 5748, 2310, 861, 14, 49, 2, 429, 1, 86, 34, 861, 27, 33, 6, 40, 1042, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 62, 419, 1179, 43, 1, 419, 1179, 101, 5, 121, 61, 13507, 3071, 861, 14, 33, 12518, 3071, 861, 27, 83, 2361, 25, 28, 79, 60, 29, 147, 1, 419, 1179, 10, 587, 166, 126, 1, 26, 375, 180, 17, 10, 73, 5, 2667, 43, 90, 36, 224, 17, 3, 287, 1, 419, 1179, 469, 154, 50, 147, 1, 864, 62]",1679.0,12036851,Low incidence second neoplasms children diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1983,3,0.003278688524590164
TEL/AML1-positive pediatric leukemia: prognostic significance and therapeutic approaches.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2002-07-01,"This article presents the most recent insights into the biology, prognostic significance, and therapeutic approaches to TEL/AML1-positive leukemia. The TEL/AML1 fusion gene, also known as ETV6 /CBFA2, is the most commonly occurring gene rearrangement in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Considerable controversy exists over its prognostic significance with currently available therapies. Differences in outcome may be explained by the differing intensities of various chemotherapy regimens, individual host responses to chemotherapy, or the hypothesis that relapsed TEL/AML1-positive leukemia represents an outgrowth of a secondary leukemia that shares a common initiating event with the first. Incorporating knowledge of this gene rearrangement into treatment decisions serves as a paradigm for translating molecular discoveries into clinically meaningful data to direct patient care and improve outcome.",Journal Article,6413.0,53.0,article presents recent insights prognostic significance therapeutic approaches TEL/AML1-positive leukemia TEL/AML1 fusion known ETV6 /CBFA2 commonly occurring rearrangement pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia Considerable controversy exists prognostic significance currently available therapies Differences outcome explained differing intensities chemotherapy regimens individual host responses chemotherapy hypothesis relapsed TEL/AML1-positive leukemia represents outgrowth secondary leukemia shares common initiating event Incorporating knowledge rearrangement treatment decisions serves paradigm translating molecular discoveries clinically meaningful direct patient care improve outcome,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 946, 2740, 3, 96, 435, 1957, 237, 3, 891, 177, 724, 2, 189, 611, 6, 8573, 6535, 109, 3, 8573, 6535, 1212, 145, 120, 440, 22, 7306, 33205, 16, 3, 96, 841, 1821, 145, 2675, 4, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 2658, 4089, 2481, 252, 211, 177, 724, 5, 694, 390, 235, 362, 4, 228, 68, 40, 3672, 20, 3, 5276, 11565, 1, 747, 56, 472, 797, 1204, 253, 6, 56, 15, 3, 1492, 17, 591, 8573, 6535, 109, 1449, 35, 7201, 1, 8, 568, 17, 10641, 8, 186, 2637, 774, 5, 3, 157, 2570, 922, 1, 26, 145, 2675, 237, 24, 1526, 4711, 22, 8, 2431, 9, 8446, 219, 5012, 237, 505, 2538, 74, 6, 1196, 69, 165, 2, 401, 228]",869.0,12042710,TEL/AML1-positive pediatric leukemia prognostic significance therapeutic approaches,0,0.0
Persistence of lymphoblasts in bone marrow on day 15 and days 22 to 25 of remission induction predicts a dismal treatment outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-07-01,"We determined the prognostic importance of morphologically identifiable persistent disease at day 15 and days 22 to 25 of remission induction in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among 546 patients entered on 2 consecutive protocols, 397 patients had evaluable bone marrow (BM) examinations on day 15 (+/- 1 day) and 218 on days 22 to 25 (+/- 1 day). Fifty-seven patients (14%) had persistent lymphoblasts (> or = 1%) in the BM on day 15 and 27 patients (5.5%) had persistent lymphoblasts on days 22 to 25. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was significantly worse for patients with lymphoblasts on day 15 (40% +/- 6%) or on days 22 to 25 (4% +/- 3%) as compared to those without lymphoblasts on these dates (78% +/- 2% and 76% +/- 2%, respectively, P <.001 for both comparisons). A worse prognosis was observed even for patients with a low percentage of lymphoblasts (ie, 1%-4%) at either day 15 (5-year EFS = 56% +/- 8%) or days 22 to 25 (5-year EFS = 0%) compared to those without morphologically identifiable persistent lymphoblasts at these times (P <.001 for both comparisons). The prognostic impact of persistent lymphoblasts on both dates remained significant after adjusting for other known risk factors, including treatment protocol, age, white blood cell count, DNA index, cell lineage, and central nervous system status, and National Cancer Institute/Rome criteria simultaneously.

Prognostic importance of measuring early clearance of leukemic cells by flow cytometry in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-07-01,"Early clearance of leukemic cells is a favorable prognostic indicator in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, identification of residual leukemic cells by their morphologic features is subjective and lacks sensitivity. To improve estimates of leukemia clearance, we applied flow cytometric techniques capable of detecting 1 leukemic cell in 10,000 or more normal cells and prospectively measured residual leukemia in bone marrow samples collected on day 19 of remission-induction chemotherapy from 248 children with newly diagnosed ALL. In 134 samples (54.0%), we identified at least 0.01% leukemic cells (0.01%-< 0.1% in 51 samples [20.6%], 0.1%-< 1% in 36 [14.5%], and > or = 1% in 47 [19.0%]). Among 110 children treated within a single chemotherapy program, the 5-year mean +/- SE cumulative incidence of relapse or failure to achieve remission was 32.2% +/- 6.5% for the 59 patients with 0.01% residual leukemic cells or greater on day 19 and 6.0% +/- 3.4% for the 51 patients with less than 0.01% leukemic cells (P <.001). The prognostic value of day-19 bone marrow status defined by flow cytometry was superior to that defined by morphologic studies and remained significant after adjustment for other clinical and biologic variables. Lack of detectable leukemic cells on day 19 was more closely associated with relapse-free survival than was lack of detectable residual disease at the end of remission induction (day 46). Thus, approximately half of the children with ALL achieve profound clearance of leukemic cells after 2 to 3 weeks of remission-induction chemotherapy, and these patients have an excellent treatment outcome.",Journal Article,6413.0,197.0,"Early clearance leukemic favorable prognostic indicator childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia identification residual leukemic morphologic features subjective lacks sensitivity improve estimates leukemia clearance applied flow cytometric techniques capable detecting 1 leukemic 10,000 normal prospectively measured residual leukemia bone marrow collected day 19 remission-induction chemotherapy 248 children newly diagnosed 134 54.0 identified 0.01 leukemic 0.01 0.1 51 20.6 0.1 1 36 14.5 1 47 19.0 110 children treated single chemotherapy program 5-year mean +/- SE cumulative incidence relapse failure achieve remission 32.2 +/- 6.5 59 patients 0.01 residual leukemic greater day 19 6.0 +/- 3.4 51 patients 0.01 leukemic P .001 prognostic value day-19 bone marrow status defined flow cytometry superior defined morphologic studies remained significant adjustment clinical biologic variables Lack detectable leukemic day 19 closely associated relapse-free survival lack detectable residual disease end remission induction day 46 approximately half children achieve profound clearance leukemic 2 3 weeks remission-induction chemotherapy patients excellent treatment outcome",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[191, 1960, 1, 2015, 37, 16, 8, 913, 177, 3287, 4, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 137, 911, 1, 753, 2015, 37, 20, 136, 2815, 404, 16, 5571, 2, 6856, 485, 6, 401, 1423, 1, 1960, 21, 1498, 1412, 6226, 1092, 2787, 1, 2502, 14, 2015, 31, 4, 79, 984, 15, 80, 295, 37, 2, 1143, 644, 753, 4, 581, 347, 786, 23, 218, 326, 1, 734, 504, 56, 29, 7100, 541, 5, 732, 265, 62, 4, 4842, 347, 667, 13, 21, 108, 28, 506, 13, 355, 2015, 37, 13, 355, 13, 14, 4, 725, 347, 179, 49, 13, 14, 14, 4, 511, 213, 33, 2, 15, 14, 4, 662, 326, 13, 107, 3129, 541, 73, 262, 8, 226, 56, 1243, 3, 33, 111, 313, 3428, 967, 287, 1, 429, 15, 496, 6, 1359, 734, 10, 531, 18, 49, 33, 9, 3, 728, 7, 5, 13, 355, 753, 2015, 37, 15, 378, 23, 218, 326, 2, 49, 13, 27, 39, 9, 3, 725, 7, 5, 299, 76, 13, 355, 2015, 37, 19, 144, 3, 177, 549, 1, 218, 326, 581, 156, 395, 20, 1412, 1914, 10, 1123, 6, 17, 395, 20, 2815, 94, 2, 958, 93, 50, 1852, 9, 127, 38, 2, 1283, 682, 926, 1, 2083, 2015, 37, 23, 218, 326, 10, 80, 3210, 41, 5, 429, 115, 25, 76, 10, 926, 1, 2083, 753, 34, 28, 3, 396, 1, 734, 504, 218, 641, 631, 705, 1303, 1, 3, 541, 5, 62, 1359, 4399, 1960, 1, 2015, 37, 50, 18, 6, 27, 244, 1, 734, 504, 56, 2, 46, 7, 47, 35, 1503, 24, 228]",1560.0,12070008,Prognostic importance measuring early clearance leukemic flow cytometry childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

We analyzed GST genotypes in 710 children with ALL treated by the Children's Cancer Group. Frequencies were compared with those of normal controls, and outcomes were analyzed according to genotype. Comparisons of gene frequencies in ALL case and control patients showed similar frequencies (54% vs 53% GSTM1 null in whites, P =.9; 40% versus 32% in blacks, P =.45; 16% versus 15% GSTT1 null in whites, P =.8; 17% versus 28% in blacks, P =.3). ALL was not associated with the GSTM1-null genotype or the double-null genotype in blacks or whites, in contrast to previous reports. Stratification of cases by age at diagnosis, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis, B or T lineage, or cytogenetics revealed no differences in genotype frequencies. Analysis of treatment outcomes showed no differences in outcome according to GST genotype; in particular, there were no differences in frequencies of relapse at any site.

Outcomes of growth hormone replacement therapy in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-07-01,"Little is known about the long-term efficacy or adverse effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have GH deficiency. We investigated the adult height of patients who had received GH and estimated their risk of leukemia relapse or development of a second malignancy. Of 910 patients treated for ALL at a single institution, 47 had received GH replacement therapy. The linear growth of these 47 patients was retrospectively evaluated. Their risk of leukemia relapse or second malignancy was compared with that of survivors who did not undergo GH therapy. The median height SD score at the start of GH therapy had decreased by 1.0 since the time of diagnosis of ALL. After a median duration of 4.5 years of GH therapy, adult height SD scores improved and approached height SD scores at the time of diagnosis of ALL. The median adult height for male patients was 173.2 cm (range, 157 to 191.9 cm), and for female patients, it was 158.1 cm (range, 141 to 168 cm).

Targeting CB2 cannabinoid receptors as a novel therapy to treat malignant lymphoblastic disease.,Blood,Blood,2002-07-01,"In the current study, we examined whether ligation of CB2 receptors would lead to induction of apoptosis in tumors of immune origin and whether CB2 agonist could be used to treat such cancers. Exposure of murine tumors EL-4, LSA, and P815 to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in vitro led to a significant reduction in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. Exposure of EL-4 tumor cells to the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide led to significant induction of apoptosis, whereas exposure to WIN55212 was not effective. Treatment of EL-4 tumor-bearing mice with THC in vivo led to a significant reduction in tumor load, increase in tumor-cell apoptosis, and increase in survival of tumor-bearing mice. Examination of a number of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, including Jurkat, Molt-4, and Sup-T1, revealed that they expressed CB2 receptors but not CB1. These human tumor cells were also susceptible to apoptosis induced by THC, HU-210, anandamide, and the CB2-selective agonist JWH-015. This effect was mediated at least in part through the CB2 receptors because pretreatment with the CB2 antagonist SR144528 partially reversed the THC-induced apoptosis. Culture of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with THC in vitro reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis. Together, the current data demonstrate that CB2 cannabinoid receptors expressed on malignancies of the immune system may serve as potential targets for the induction of apoptosis. Also, because CB2 agonists lack psychotropic effects, they may serve as novel anticancer agents to selectively target and kill tumors of immune origin.",Journal Article,6413.0,210.0,current examined ligation CB2 receptors lead induction apoptosis immune origin CB2 agonist treat Exposure murine EL-4 LSA P815 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol THC vitro led significant reduction viability increase apoptosis Exposure EL-4 synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 endogenous cannabinoid anandamide led significant induction apoptosis exposure WIN55212 effective Treatment EL-4 tumor-bearing mice THC vivo led significant reduction load increase tumor-cell apoptosis increase survival tumor-bearing mice Examination number human leukemia lymphoma lines including Jurkat Molt-4 Sup-T1 revealed expressed CB2 receptors CB1 human susceptible apoptosis induced THC HU-210 anandamide CB2-selective agonist JWH-015 effect mediated CB2 receptors pretreatment CB2 antagonist SR144528 partially reversed THC-induced apoptosis Culture primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia THC vitro reduced viability induced apoptosis current demonstrate CB2 cannabinoid receptors expressed malignancies immune serve potential targets induction apoptosis CB2 agonists lack psychotropic effects serve novel anticancer agents selectively target kill immune origin,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 409, 317, 5307, 1, 24469, 1186, 688, 1122, 6, 504, 1, 351, 4, 57, 1, 250, 1938, 2, 317, 24469, 3821, 359, 40, 95, 6, 943, 225, 163, 645, 1, 1471, 57, 8852, 39, 52981, 2, 37212, 6, 4305, 83, 42970, 14771, 4, 439, 836, 6, 8, 93, 628, 4, 31, 2120, 2, 35, 344, 4, 351, 645, 1, 8852, 39, 30, 37, 6, 3, 3273, 27923, 5948, 5376, 2, 3, 2682, 27923, 42971, 836, 6, 93, 504, 1, 351, 547, 645, 6, 52982, 10, 44, 323, 24, 1, 8852, 39, 30, 1894, 399, 5, 14771, 4, 386, 836, 6, 8, 93, 628, 4, 30, 3800, 344, 4, 30, 31, 351, 2, 344, 4, 25, 1, 30, 1894, 399, 1385, 1, 8, 207, 1, 171, 2, 31, 285, 141, 8433, 30270, 39, 2, 172, 1534, 553, 17, 491, 570, 24469, 1186, 84, 44, 23099, 46, 171, 30, 37, 11, 120, 4012, 6, 351, 277, 20, 14771, 5948, 5376, 42971, 2, 3, 24469, 1094, 3821, 52983, 3433, 26, 254, 10, 517, 28, 506, 4, 760, 298, 3, 24469, 1186, 408, 1194, 5, 3, 24469, 3137, 52984, 2995, 3682, 3, 14771, 277, 351, 2099, 1, 86, 286, 1275, 37, 5, 14771, 4, 439, 405, 31, 2120, 2, 277, 351, 1162, 3, 291, 74, 608, 17, 24469, 27923, 1186, 570, 23, 441, 1, 3, 250, 398, 68, 1833, 22, 174, 637, 9, 3, 504, 1, 351, 120, 408, 24469, 4774, 926, 24470, 176, 491, 68, 1833, 22, 229, 1475, 183, 6, 2382, 283, 2, 5097, 57, 1, 250, 1938]",1602.0,12091357,Targeting CB2 cannabinoid receptors novel therapy treat malignant lymphoblastic disease,37,0.040437158469945354
Methotrexate intracellular disposition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a mathematical model of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase activity.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-07-01,"Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate that is widely used for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and a number of other malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Within cells, MTX is metabolized to more active methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), and these polyglutamates are subsequently cleaved in lysosomes by gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH). GGH is reported to act as either an endopeptidase or an exopeptidase, exhibiting species differences in these functions. To better define the in vivo functions of GGH in human leukemia cells, we characterized GGH activity with different MTXPG substrates (MTX with three to five glutamates) in human T- and B-lineage leukemia cell lines, and in primary leukemia cells from newly diagnosed patients with ALL. Parameters estimated from fitting a series of hypothetical mathematical models to the data revealed that the experimental data were best fit by a model where GGH simultaneously cleaved multiple glutamyl residues, with highest activity at cleaving the outermost or two outermost residues from a polyglutamate chain. The model also revealed that GGH has a higher affinity for longer chain polyglutamates. Together, these findings provide new insights to the intracellular disposition of MTX in human ALL cells, and provides a mechanism-based model for characterizing differences among patients and genetic subtypes of ALL.",Comparative Study,6413.0,54.0,Methotrexate MTX antifolate widely treatment childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia number malignant nonmalignant diseases MTX metabolized active methotrexate polyglutamates MTXPG polyglutamates subsequently cleaved lysosomes gamma-glutamyl hydrolase GGH GGH reported act endopeptidase exopeptidase exhibiting species differences functions better define vivo functions GGH human leukemia characterized GGH activity different MTXPG substrates MTX glutamates human T- B-lineage leukemia lines primary leukemia newly diagnosed patients Parameters estimated fitting series hypothetical mathematical models revealed experimental best fit model GGH simultaneously cleaved multiple glutamyl residues highest activity cleaving outermost outermost residues polyglutamate chain model revealed GGH higher affinity longer chain polyglutamates findings provide new insights intracellular disposition MTX human provides mechanism-based model characterizing differences patients genetic subtypes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2116, 3453, 16, 35, 12278, 17, 16, 1792, 95, 9, 3, 24, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 8, 207, 1, 127, 393, 2, 5967, 1342, 262, 37, 3453, 16, 10523, 6, 80, 544, 2116, 16243, 11572, 2, 46, 16243, 32, 1611, 5885, 4, 22005, 20, 1705, 15867, 18796, 10820, 10820, 16, 210, 6, 2559, 22, 361, 35, 26033, 15, 35, 37225, 4801, 2915, 362, 4, 46, 1681, 6, 380, 1107, 3, 4, 386, 1681, 1, 10820, 4, 171, 37, 21, 765, 10820, 128, 5, 338, 11572, 6063, 3453, 5, 169, 6, 365, 42987, 4, 171, 102, 2, 132, 2542, 31, 285, 2, 4, 86, 37, 29, 732, 265, 7, 5, 62, 1038, 661, 29, 9748, 8, 988, 1, 7045, 7419, 274, 6, 3, 74, 553, 17, 3, 1560, 74, 11, 824, 2975, 20, 8, 202, 1257, 10820, 3074, 5885, 232, 15867, 6418, 5, 1076, 128, 28, 24481, 3, 30265, 15, 100, 30265, 6418, 29, 8, 22006, 1260, 3, 202, 120, 553, 17, 10820, 71, 8, 142, 3601, 9, 589, 1260, 16243, 1162, 46, 272, 377, 217, 1957, 6, 3, 2087, 5814, 1, 3453, 4, 171, 62, 37, 2, 777, 8, 670, 90, 202, 9, 5723, 362, 107, 7, 2, 336, 814, 1, 62]",1330.0,12114448,Methotrexate intracellular disposition acute lymphoblastic leukemia mathematical model gamma-glutamyl hydrolase activity,26,0.02841530054644809
De novo purine synthesis inhibition and antileukemic effects of mercaptopurine alone or in combination with methotrexate in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2002-08-01,"Methotrexate (MTX) and mercaptopurine (MP) are widely used antileukemic agents that inhibit de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) as a mechanism of their antileukemic effects. To elucidate pharmacodynamic differences among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), DNPS was measured in leukemic blasts from newly diagnosed patients before and after therapy with these agents. Patients were randomized to receive low-dose MTX (LDMTX: 6 oral doses of 30 mg/m(2)) or high-dose MTX (HDMTX: intravenous 1 g/m(2)) followed by intravenous MP; or intravenous MP alone (1 g/m(2)), as initial therapy. At diagnosis, the rate of DNPS in bone marrow leukemia cells was 3-fold higher in patients with T-lineage ALL compared with those with B-lineage ALL (769 +/- 189 vs 250 +/- 38 fmol/nmol/h; P =.001). DNPS was not consistently inhibited following MP alone but was markedly inhibited following MTX plus MP (median decrease 3% vs 94%; P <.001). LDMTX plus MP and HDMTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects (percentage decrease in circulating leukocyte counts) compared with MP alone (-50% +/- 4%, -56% +/- 3%, and - 20% +/- 4%, respectively; P <.0001). Full DNPS inhibition was associated with greater antileukemic effects compared with partial or no inhibition (-63% +/- 4% vs -37% +/- 4%; P <.0001) in patients with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage and T-lineage ALL. HDMTX plus MP yielded 2-fold higher MTX polyglutamate concentrations than LDMTX plus MP (2148 +/- 298 vs 1075 +/- 114 pmol/10(9) cells; P <.01) and a higher percentage of patients with full DNPS inhibition (78% vs 53%; P <.001). Thus, the extent of DNPS inhibition was related to in vivo antileukemic effects, and a single dose of intravenous MP produced minimal DNPS inhibition and antileukemic effects, whereas MTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects and DNPS inhibition, with full inhibition more frequent after HDMTX.",Clinical Trial,6382.0,77.0,Methotrexate MTX mercaptopurine MP widely antileukemic agents inhibit novo purine synthesis DNPS mechanism antileukemic effects elucidate pharmacodynamic differences children acute lymphoblastic leukemia DNPS measured leukemic blasts newly diagnosed patients therapy agents Patients randomized receive low-dose MTX LDMTX 6 oral doses 30 mg/m 2 high-dose MTX HDMTX intravenous 1 g/m 2 followed intravenous MP intravenous MP 1 g/m 2 initial therapy diagnosis rate DNPS bone marrow leukemia 3-fold higher patients T-lineage compared B-lineage 769 +/- 189 vs 250 +/- 38 fmol/nmol/h P =.001 DNPS consistently inhibited following MP markedly inhibited following MTX plus MP median decrease 3 vs 94 P .001 LDMTX plus MP HDMTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects percentage decrease circulating leukocyte counts compared MP -50 +/- 4 -56 +/- 3 20 +/- 4 respectively P .0001 DNPS inhibition associated greater antileukemic effects compared partial inhibition -63 +/- 4 vs -37 +/- 4 P .0001 patients nonhyperdiploid B-lineage T-lineage HDMTX plus MP yielded 2-fold higher MTX polyglutamate concentrations LDMTX plus MP 2148 +/- 298 vs 1075 +/- 114 pmol/10 9 P .01 higher percentage patients DNPS inhibition 78 vs 53 P .001 extent DNPS inhibition related vivo antileukemic effects single dose intravenous MP produced minimal DNPS inhibition antileukemic effects MTX plus MP produced greater antileukemic effects DNPS inhibition inhibition frequent HDMTX,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2116, 3453, 2, 9223, 4545, 32, 1792, 95, 4512, 183, 17, 1433, 1566, 2018, 5006, 2525, 18803, 22, 8, 670, 1, 136, 4512, 176, 6, 3061, 2424, 362, 107, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 18803, 10, 644, 4, 2015, 2438, 29, 732, 265, 7, 348, 2, 50, 36, 5, 46, 183, 7, 11, 384, 6, 560, 154, 61, 3453, 37239, 49, 518, 415, 1, 201, 81, 188, 18, 15, 64, 61, 3453, 10061, 1262, 14, 499, 188, 18, 370, 20, 1262, 4545, 15, 1262, 4545, 279, 14, 499, 188, 18, 22, 388, 36, 28, 147, 3, 116, 1, 18803, 4, 581, 37, 10, 27, 1116, 142, 4, 7, 5, 102, 2542, 62, 72, 5, 135, 5, 132, 2542, 62, 17658, 5899, 105, 2039, 519, 18804, 4694, 555, 19, 144, 18803, 10, 44, 2433, 879, 366, 4545, 279, 84, 10, 2195, 879, 366, 3453, 349, 4545, 52, 775, 27, 105, 960, 19, 144, 37239, 349, 4545, 2, 10061, 349, 4545, 1687, 378, 4512, 176, 1150, 775, 4, 1033, 3627, 1911, 72, 5, 4545, 279, 212, 39, 664, 27, 2, 179, 39, 106, 19, 488, 1647, 18803, 297, 10, 41, 5, 378, 4512, 176, 72, 5, 450, 15, 77, 297, 676, 39, 105, 567, 39, 19, 488, 4, 7, 5, 26040, 132, 2542, 2, 102, 2542, 62, 10061, 349, 4545, 2178, 18, 1116, 142, 3453, 22006, 1003, 76, 37239, 349, 4545, 37240, 8651, 105, 26041, 3803, 9835, 79, 83, 37, 19, 355, 2, 8, 142, 1150, 1, 7, 5, 1647, 18803, 297, 833, 105, 699, 19, 144, 631, 3, 1039, 1, 18803, 297, 10, 139, 6, 4, 386, 4512, 176, 2, 8, 226, 61, 1, 1262, 4545, 1687, 1048, 18803, 297, 2, 4512, 176, 547, 3453, 349, 4545, 1687, 378, 4512, 176, 2, 18803, 297, 5, 1647, 297, 80, 908, 50, 10061]",1789.0,12149204,novo purine synthesis inhibition antileukemic effects mercaptopurine combination methotrexate vivo,1,0.001092896174863388
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia- current concepts and future perspectives.,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,2002-06-01,"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is diagnosed rarely in children, but constitutes the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in adults with ALL. In contrast to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), patients with Ph-positive ALL usually demonstrate expression of a truncated version of the BCR-ABL protein called p190bcr-abl. Irrespective of age and breakpoint location, Ph-positive ALL carries a poor prognosis. Although remission rates are identical to those of Ph-negative ALL, relapse is almost universal and long-term survival remains rare. Given the poor outcome with current chemotherapy consolidation programs, stem cell transplantation is usually recommended for these patients in first remission or as soon as feasible.

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,2002-06-01,"As cure rates in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia reach 80%, emphasis is increasingly placed on the accurate identification of drug-resistant cases, the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in drug resistance and the development of new therapeutic strategies targeted toward the pivotal molecular lesions. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenomic studies have provided rational criteria for individualizing therapy to enhance efficacy and reduce acute toxicity and late sequelae. Currently, assessment of the early response to treatment by measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) is the most powerful independent prognostic indicator. MRD is affected by both the drug sensitivity of leukemic cells and the pharmacodynamic and pharmacogenetic properties of the host cells. Rapid advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics should ultimately facilitate the development of molecular diagnostic assays that can be used to optimize antileukemic therapy and elucidate the mechanisms of leukemogenesis.

Racial and ethnic differences in survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-09-01,"Black children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have poor outcomes, but limited information is available for children from other racial and ethnic backgrounds, such as Hispanic and Asian. We undertook a retrospective cohort study of children with ALL treated on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic protocols to determine outcomes by racial and ethnic backgrounds of patients treated with contemporary risk-based therapy. In total, 8447 children (white, n = 6703; Hispanic, n = 1071; black, n = 506; and Asian, n = 167) with newly diagnosed ALL between 1983 and 1995 were observed for a median of 6.5 years. Analysis of disease outcome was measured as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) and was adjusted for known predictors of outcome including clinical features, disease biology, socioeconomic status, and treatment era (1983-1989 vs 1989-1995). There was a statistically significant difference in survival by ethnicity (P <.001). Five-year EFS rates were: Asian, 75.1% +/- 3.5%; white, 72.8% +/- 0.6%; Hispanic, 65.9% +/- 1.5%; and black, 61.5% +/- 2.2%. Multivariate analysis revealed that when compared with white children, black and Hispanic children had worse outcomes and Asian children had better outcomes after adjusting for known risk factors. The poorer outcomes among black children were most apparent among patients with standard-risk features (relative risk [RR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.5), whereas poorer outcomes in Hispanic children (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) were most evident among patients with high-risk features. Asian children had better outcomes than all racial and ethnic groups among high-risk patients, particularly in the recent era (5-year EFS, 90.9% +/- 6.1%). Racial and ethnic differences in OS and EFS persist among children with ALL who receive contemporary risk-based therapy.

Imatinib is an orally administered, potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. We conducted a clinical trial in 56 patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 48 patients) or chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis (LyBC; 8 patients). Imatinib was given once daily at 400 mg or 600 mg. Imatinib induced complete hematologic responses (CHRs) and complete marrow responses (marrow-CRs) in 29% of ALL patients (CHR, 19%; marrow-CR, 10%), which were sustained for at least 4 weeks in 6% of patients. Median estimated time to progression and overall survival for ALL patients were 2.2 and 4.9 months, respectively. CHRs were reported for 3 (38%) of the patients with LyBC (one sustained CHR). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related nonhematologic toxicity was reported for 9% of patients; none of the patients discontinued therapy because of nonhematologic adverse reactions. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 54% and 27% of patients, respectively. Imatinib therapy resulted in a clinically relevant hematologic response rate in relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoid leukemia patients, but development of resistance and subsequent disease progression were rapid.

"A single, high dose of idarubicin combined with cytarabine as induction therapy for adult patients with recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2002-08-01,"The majority of adult patients who are treated for lymphoblastic disease will either develop recurrent disease or will be refractory to their initial therapy. One option for patients with recurrent/refractory disease is to administer a reinduction regimen that employs a dose-intense combination of anthracycline and cytarabine. These salvage regimens are relatively distinct from the traditional vincristine/prednisone-based programs that are used typically as primary induction therapy. The authors studied a regimen that contained high-dose cytarabine and a single high dose of idarubicin as salvage induction therapy for patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoblastic disease. Twenty-nine previously treated adult patients with recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with a new intensive regimen. Eight patients had primary refractory disease. Twenty-one patients had recurrent disease, and 16 of these patients developed recurrent disease while they were still receiving their primary therapy. The treatment regimen consisted of cytarabine 3.0 g/m(2) by 3-hour infusion daily for 5 days and idarubicin 40 mg/m(2) given as a single dose on Day 3. Filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) 5 microg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours was started on Day 7 and was continued until the absolute neutrophil count was > 5000/microL. Response was assessed using standard criteria. There were 11 complete responses (38%; 95% confidence interval, 20-56%). Four patients subsequently underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Moderate but acceptable toxicity was observed given the severely myelosuppressive nature of the regimen. There was only one treatment-related death (3%). Two patients, both with significant prior exposure to anthracyclines, suffered reductions in left ventricular function to the 20-30% range during episodes of severe systemic infection.

Use of peripheral blood instead of bone marrow to monitor residual disease in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-10-01,"In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), response to treatment is assessed by bone marrow aspiration. We investigated whether minimal residual disease (MRD) can be effectively monitored in peripheral blood. We used flow cytometric techniques capable of detecting 1 leukemic cell among 10 000 or more normal cells to compare MRD measurements in 718 pairs of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples collected from 226 children during treatment for newly diagnosed ALL. MRD was detected in marrow and blood in 72 pairs and in marrow but not in blood in 67 pairs; it was undetectable in the remaining 579 pairs. Remarkably, findings in marrow and blood were completely concordant in the 150 paired samples from patients with T-lineage ALL: for each of the 35 positive marrow samples, the corresponding blood sample was positive. In B-lineage ALL, however, only 37 of 104 positive marrow samples had a corresponding positive blood sample. Notably, peripheral blood MRD in these patients was associated with a very high risk for disease recurrence. The 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients with B-lineage ALL was 80.0% +/- 24.9% for those who had peripheral blood MRD at the end of remission induction therapy but only 13.3% +/- 9.1% for those with MRD confined to the marrow (P =.007).

Endocrine complications in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood reviews,Blood Rev.,2002-12-01,"Endocrine complications of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are common and are potentially debilitating both during and after therapy. Growth velocity slows during therapy for ALL, especially during the first year; however, children who do not receive cranial irradiation usually reach normal adult height. While growth hormone deficiency generally occurs in patients who have received 24Gy of cranial irradiation, it may also develop in those treated with lower doses (18Gy) of cranial radiation or with only high-dose methotrexate. Obesity commonly occurs during therapy and persists after completion of therapy. Osteopenia can occur early during therapy for ALL and can persist for many years. Adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in any child who has recently received glucocorticoid therapy, and stress doses of steroid should be administered in the event of metabolic stress. Screening of urine is useful for early detection of hyperglycemia during therapy with glucocorticoids and L-asparaginase. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone is usually associated with vincristine therapy and may be aggravated by concurrent use of azole antifungals.

Limited and optimal sampling strategies for etoposide and etoposide catechol in children with leukemia.,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,2002-04-01,"Etoposide is used to treat childhood malignancies, and its plasma pharmacokinetics have been related to pharmacodynamic endpoints. Limiting the number of samples should facilitate the assessment of etoposide pharmacokinetics in children. We compared limited sampling strategies using multiple linear regression of plasma concentrations and clearance with Bayesian methods of estimating clearance using compartmental pharmacokinetic models. Optimal sampling times were estimated in the multiple linear regression method by determining the combination of two samples which maximized the correlation coefficient, and in the Bayesian estimation approach by minimizing the variance in estimates of clearance. Clearance estimates were compared to the actual clearances from Monte Carlo-simulated data and predicted clearances estimated using all available plasma concentrations in clinical data from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Parental medication use and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-10-01,"Few studies have examined the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with parental medication use. As part of a large case-control study conducted by the Children's Cancer Group, we evaluated the association between maternal and paternal medication use and the risk of ALL in offspring. Information on selected medication use in the year before and during the index pregnancy was obtained by telephone interview. Participants included 1842 children of 14 years or younger with newly diagnosed and immunophenotypically defined ALL and 1986 individually matched controls. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models and stratified by immunophenotypes of ALL and age at diagnosis of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders and other medication use, we found that maternal use of vitamins (odds ratio [OR] = 0.7, 99% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.0) and iron supplements (OR = 0.8, 99% CI: 0.7-1.0) only during the index pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of ALL. Parental use of amphetamines or diet pills and mind-altering drugs before and during the index pregnancy was related to an increased risk of childhood ALL, particularly among children where both parents reported using these drugs (OR = 2.8, 99% CI: 0.5-15.6 for amphetamines or diet pills, OR = 1.8, 99% CI: 1.1-3.0 for mind-altering drugs). Stratified analyses showed that maternal use of antihistamines or allergic remedies and parental use of mind-altering drugs were strongly associated with infant ALL, whereas patterns of association between childhood ALL and parental medication use did not influence markedly the immunophenotypic subgroup of ALL. The findings of this study suggest that certain parental medication use immediately before and during the index pregnancy may influence risk of ALL in offspring.",Journal Article,6321.0,64.0,studies examined risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated parental medication use large case-control conducted Children 's Group evaluated association maternal paternal medication use risk offspring Information selected medication use year index pregnancy obtained telephone interview Participants included 1842 children 14 years younger newly diagnosed immunophenotypically defined 1986 individually matched controls logistic regression models stratified immunophenotypes age diagnosis cases adjusting potential confounders medication use maternal use vitamins odds ratio 0.7 99 confidence interval CI 0.5-1.0 iron supplements 0.8 99 CI 0.7-1.0 index pregnancy associated decreased risk Parental use amphetamines diet pills mind-altering drugs index pregnancy related increased risk childhood particularly children parents reported drugs 2.8 99 CI 0.5-15.6 amphetamines diet pills 1.8 99 CI 1.1-3.0 mind-altering drugs Stratified showed maternal use antihistamines allergic remedies parental use mind-altering drugs strongly associated infant patterns association childhood parental medication use influence markedly immunophenotypic subgroup findings suggest certain parental medication use immediately index pregnancy influence risk offspring,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1021, 94, 47, 409, 3, 43, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 41, 5, 3418, 3012, 119, 22, 760, 1, 8, 375, 473, 182, 45, 426, 20, 3, 541, 292, 12, 87, 21, 194, 3, 248, 59, 6039, 2, 10649, 3012, 119, 2, 3, 43, 1, 62, 4, 8304, 487, 23, 715, 3012, 119, 4, 3, 111, 348, 2, 190, 3, 558, 2290, 10, 683, 20, 4258, 4313, 776, 159, 25986, 541, 1, 213, 60, 15, 773, 5, 732, 265, 2, 24516, 395, 62, 2, 3751, 4257, 655, 535, 74, 11, 311, 75, 812, 320, 274, 2, 1173, 20, 16679, 1, 62, 2, 89, 28, 147, 1, 140, 50, 1358, 9, 174, 4423, 2, 127, 3012, 119, 21, 204, 17, 6039, 119, 1, 9447, 610, 197, 15, 13, 67, 1058, 307, 268, 58, 13, 33, 14, 13, 2, 4231, 6600, 15, 13, 66, 1058, 58, 13, 67, 14, 13, 158, 190, 3, 558, 2290, 10, 41, 5, 8, 340, 43, 1, 62, 3418, 119, 1, 37281, 15, 2453, 17655, 2, 8090, 4831, 600, 348, 2, 190, 3, 558, 2290, 10, 139, 6, 35, 101, 43, 1, 864, 62, 823, 107, 541, 1257, 110, 2418, 210, 75, 46, 600, 15, 18, 66, 1058, 58, 13, 33, 167, 49, 9, 37281, 15, 2453, 17655, 15, 14, 66, 1058, 58, 14, 14, 27, 13, 9, 8090, 4831, 600, 1173, 318, 224, 17, 6039, 119, 1, 27966, 15, 7465, 25973, 2, 3418, 119, 1, 8090, 4831, 600, 11, 1327, 41, 5, 8027, 62, 547, 764, 1, 248, 59, 864, 62, 2, 3418, 3012, 119, 205, 44, 1054, 2195, 3, 6599, 1363, 1, 62, 3, 272, 1, 26, 45, 309, 17, 1840, 3418, 3012, 119, 3467, 348, 2, 190, 3, 558, 2290, 68, 1054, 43, 1, 62, 4, 8304]",1778.0,12365028,Parental medication use risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,11,0.012021857923497269
Risk factors for traumatic and bloody lumbar puncture in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,JAMA,JAMA,,"Traumatic or bloody lumbar puncture (LP) reduces the diagnostic value of the procedure and may worsen the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Little is known about the risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP. To determine the risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP. Retrospective cohort study of 956 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed childhood ALL who were treated at a pediatric cancer center between February 1984 and July 1998. All patients underwent a diagnostic LP followed by a median of 4 LPs to instill intrathecal chemotherapy. Traumatic LP was defined as an LP in which cerebrospinal fluid contained at least 10 red blood cells (RBCs) per microliter and bloody LP as one in which the cerebrospinal fluid contained at least 500 RBCs per microliter. Of the 5609 LPs evaluated, 1643 (29%) were traumatic and 581 (10%) were bloody. The estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for traumatic LP were 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) for black vs white race, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7-3.0) for age younger than 1 year vs 1 year or older, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.7) for early vs recent (dedicated procedure area and general anesthesia) treatment era, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) for platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/ microL or more vs less than 100 x 10(3 )/ microL, 10.8 (95% CI, 7.7-15.2) for short (1 day) vs longer (>15 days) interval since the previous LP, and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) for the least vs the most experienced practitioners. Analyses for bloody LP yielded similar results. The unmodifiable risk factors for traumatic and bloody LP include black race, age younger than 1 year, a traumatic or bloody previous LP performed within the past 2 weeks, and a previous LP performed when the platelet count was 50 x 10(3)/ microL or less. Modifiable risk factors include procedural factors reflected in treatment era, platelet count of 100 x 10(3)/ microL or less, an interval of 15 days or less between LPs, and a less experienced practitioner.",Journal Article,,,Traumatic bloody lumbar puncture LP reduces diagnostic value procedure worsen outcome patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia Little known risk factors traumatic bloody LP determine risk factors traumatic bloody LP Retrospective cohort 956 consecutive patients newly diagnosed childhood treated pediatric center February 1984 July 1998 patients underwent diagnostic LP followed median 4 LPs instill intrathecal chemotherapy Traumatic LP defined LP cerebrospinal fluid contained 10 red blood RBCs microliter bloody LP cerebrospinal fluid contained 500 RBCs microliter 5609 LPs evaluated 1643 29 traumatic 581 10 bloody estimated odds ratios ORs 95 confidence intervals CIs traumatic LP 1.5 95 CI 1.2-1.8 black vs white race 2.3 95 CI 1.7-3.0 age younger 1 year vs 1 year older 1.4 95 CI 1.2-1.7 early vs recent dedicated procedure area general anesthesia treatment era 1.5 95 CI 1.2-1.8 platelet count 100 x 10 3 microL vs 100 x 10 3 microL 10.8 95 CI 7.7-15.2 short 1 day vs longer 15 days interval previous LP 1.4 95 CI 1.1-1.8 vs experienced practitioners bloody LP yielded similar unmodifiable risk factors traumatic bloody LP include black race age younger 1 year traumatic bloody previous LP performed past 2 weeks previous LP performed platelet count 50 x 10 3 microL Modifiable risk factors include procedural factors reflected treatment era platelet count 100 x 10 3 microL interval 15 days LPs experienced practitioner,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[11272, 15, 18830, 6187, 12104, 6427, 2389, 3, 752, 549, 1, 3, 1299, 2, 68, 12500, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 43, 130, 9, 11272, 2, 18830, 6427, 6, 223, 3, 43, 130, 9, 11272, 2, 18830, 6427, 459, 180, 45, 1, 14137, 935, 7, 5, 732, 265, 864, 62, 54, 11, 73, 28, 8, 815, 12, 574, 59, 3010, 6036, 2, 2066, 1850, 62, 7, 208, 8, 752, 6427, 370, 20, 8, 52, 1, 39, 6310, 6, 53163, 5126, 56, 11272, 6427, 10, 395, 22, 35, 6427, 4, 92, 5156, 2357, 3070, 28, 506, 79, 3422, 315, 37, 15859, 379, 23159, 2, 18830, 6427, 22, 104, 4, 92, 3, 5156, 2357, 3070, 28, 506, 1666, 15859, 379, 23159, 1, 3, 53164, 6310, 194, 37294, 462, 11, 11272, 2, 12482, 79, 11, 18830, 3, 661, 610, 1137, 3694, 2, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 9, 11272, 6427, 11, 14, 33, 48, 58, 14, 18, 14, 66, 9, 1445, 105, 886, 1047, 18, 27, 48, 58, 14, 67, 27, 13, 9, 89, 773, 76, 14, 111, 105, 14, 111, 15, 434, 14, 39, 48, 58, 14, 18, 14, 67, 9, 191, 105, 435, 4827, 1299, 965, 2, 1083, 6433, 24, 1713, 14, 33, 48, 58, 14, 18, 14, 66, 9, 1596, 1276, 1, 394, 1006, 79, 27, 5128, 15, 80, 105, 299, 76, 394, 1006, 79, 27, 5128, 79, 66, 48, 58, 67, 67, 167, 18, 9, 978, 14, 218, 105, 589, 167, 162, 268, 1192, 3, 698, 6427, 2, 14, 39, 48, 58, 14, 14, 14, 66, 9, 3, 506, 105, 3, 96, 592, 6323, 318, 9, 18830, 6427, 2178, 288, 99, 3, 53165, 43, 130, 9, 11272, 2, 18830, 6427, 643, 1445, 1047, 89, 773, 76, 14, 111, 8, 11272, 15, 18830, 698, 6427, 173, 262, 3, 1219, 18, 244, 2, 8, 698, 6427, 173, 198, 3, 1596, 1276, 10, 212, 1006, 79, 27, 5128, 15, 299, 5222, 43, 130, 643, 8492, 130, 4686, 4, 24, 1713, 1596, 1276, 1, 394, 1006, 79, 27, 5128, 15, 299, 35, 268, 1, 167, 162, 15, 299, 59, 6310, 2, 8, 299, 592, 11929]",1889.0,12387652,Risk factors traumatic bloody lumbar puncture children acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
T-cell clones can be rendered specific for CD19: toward the selective augmentation of the graft-versus-B-lineage leukemia effect.,Blood,Blood,2002-10-10,"Relapse of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) commonly results from the failure of a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect to eradicate minimal residual disease. Augmenting the GVL effect by the adoptive transfer of donor-derived B-ALL-specific T-cell clones is a conceptually attractive strategy to decrease relapse rates without exacerbating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Toward this end, we investigated whether a genetic engineering approach could render CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for tumor cells that express the B-cell lineage cell surface molecule CD19. This was accomplished by the genetic modification of CTLs to express a chimeric immunoreceptor composed of a CD19-specific single-chain immunoglobulin extracellular targeting domain fused to a CD3-zeta intracellular signaling domain. CD19-redirected CTL clones display potent CD19-specific lytic activity and chimeric immunoreceptor-regulated cytokine production and proliferation. Because B-ALL cells can evade T-cell/natural killer- cell recognition by down-regulation of cell surface accessory molecules that participate in the formation of a functional immunologic synapse, we compared the CD19-specific effector function of genetically modified CD8(+) CTLs toward CD19(+) cells with disparate levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and LFA-3. We observed that recognition of B-lineage tumor lines by CD19-specific CTLs was not impaired by low levels of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and LFA-3 cell surface expression, a functional attribute that is likely a consequence of our high-affinity CD19-specific chimeric immunoreceptor.

"Phase 1 and pharmacodynamic studies of G3139, a Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide, in combination with chemotherapy in refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.",Blood,Blood,2002-08-22,"Overexpression of Bcl-2 is a potential mechanism for chemoresistance in acute leukemia and has been associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. We hypothesized that down-regulation of Bcl-2 would restore chemosensitivity in leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase 1 study of G3139 (Genasense, Genta, Berkeley Heights, NJ), an 18-mer phosphorothioate Bcl-2 antisense, with fludarabine (FL), cytarabine (ARA-C), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (FLAG) salvage chemotherapy in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia. Twenty patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. G3139 was delivered by continuous infusion on days 1 to 10. FLAG chemotherapy was administered on days 5 to 10. Common side effects of this combination included fever, nausea, emesis, electrolyte imbalance, and fluid retention that were not dose limiting. Plasma pharmacokinetics of G3139 demonstrated steady-state concentration (Css) within 24 hours. Of the 20 patients, 9 (45%) had disease response, 6 (5 AML, 1 ALL) with complete remission (CR) and 3 (2 AML and 1 ALL) with no evidence of disease but failure to recover normal neutrophil and/or platelet counts or to remain in remission for at least 30 days (incomplete remission). Bcl-2 mRNA levels were down-regulated in 9 of the 12 (75%) evaluable patients. This study demonstrates that G3139 can be administered safely with FLAG chemotherapy and down-regulate its target, Bcl-2. The encouraging clinical and laboratory results justify the current plans for a phase 3 study in previously untreated high-risk AML (ie, age at least 60 years).",Clinical Trial,6361.0,186.0,Overexpression Bcl-2 potential mechanism chemoresistance acute leukemia associated unfavorable clinical outcome hypothesized down-regulation Bcl-2 restore chemosensitivity leukemic test hypothesis performed phase 1 G3139 Genasense Genta Berkeley Heights NJ 18-mer phosphorothioate Bcl-2 antisense fludarabine FL cytarabine ARA-C granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF FLAG salvage chemotherapy patients refractory relapsed acute leukemia patients refractory relapsed acute myeloid leukemia AML acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled G3139 delivered continuous infusion days 1 10 FLAG chemotherapy administered days 5 10 Common effects combination included fever nausea emesis electrolyte imbalance fluid retention dose limiting Plasma pharmacokinetics G3139 demonstrated steady-state concentration Css 24 hours 20 patients 9 45 disease response 6 5 AML 1 complete remission CR 3 2 AML 1 evidence disease failure recover normal neutrophil and/or platelet counts remain remission 30 days incomplete remission Bcl-2 mRNA levels down-regulated 9 12 75 evaluable patients demonstrates G3139 administered safely FLAG chemotherapy down-regulate target Bcl-2 encouraging clinical laboratory justify current plans phase 3 previously untreated high-risk AML age 60 years,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[851, 1, 1044, 18, 16, 8, 174, 670, 9, 3782, 4, 286, 2, 71, 85, 41, 5, 2483, 38, 228, 21, 1237, 17, 1328, 863, 1, 1044, 18, 688, 6075, 5522, 4, 2015, 37, 6, 412, 26, 1492, 21, 173, 8, 124, 14, 45, 1, 8252, 30327, 53176, 43057, 23162, 12754, 35, 203, 10068, 26074, 1044, 18, 4645, 5, 2027, 2633, 1855, 3899, 256, 2, 2764, 1975, 2122, 161, 499, 1211, 12546, 992, 56, 4, 7, 5, 430, 15, 591, 286, 737, 7, 5, 430, 15, 591, 286, 533, 329, 15, 286, 1275, 62, 11, 346, 8252, 10, 1623, 20, 1314, 904, 23, 162, 14, 6, 79, 12546, 56, 10, 468, 23, 162, 33, 6, 79, 186, 1152, 176, 1, 26, 150, 159, 2775, 1218, 6899, 10834, 6088, 2, 2357, 3947, 17, 11, 44, 61, 817, 554, 1159, 1, 8252, 264, 4152, 1309, 1227, 2687, 262, 259, 1459, 1, 3, 179, 7, 83, 512, 42, 34, 51, 49, 33, 329, 14, 62, 5, 236, 734, 684, 2, 27, 18, 329, 2, 14, 62, 5, 77, 241, 1, 34, 84, 496, 6, 9966, 295, 2595, 2, 15, 1596, 1911, 15, 6, 918, 4, 734, 9, 28, 506, 201, 162, 2610, 734, 1044, 18, 956, 148, 11, 1328, 1065, 4, 83, 1, 3, 133, 481, 859, 7, 26, 45, 1902, 17, 8252, 122, 40, 468, 2268, 5, 12546, 56, 2, 1328, 2288, 211, 283, 1044, 18, 3, 2269, 38, 2, 1624, 99, 6665, 3, 291, 1853, 9, 8, 124, 27, 45, 4, 373, 1278, 64, 43, 329, 2523, 89, 28, 506, 335, 60]",1593.0,12393493,Phase 1 pharmacodynamic studies G3139 Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide combination chemotherapy refractory relapsed acute leukemia,4,0.004371584699453552
"Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and NQO1 in children who developed therapy-related myeloid malignancies.",Pharmacogenetics,Pharmacogenetics,2002-11-01,"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (t-ML) are serious complications that affect some patients after acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Genetic polymorphisms in the promoter of CYP3A4 (CYP3A4*1B) and in NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1609C-->T substitution) have been associated with the risk of t-ML. A polymorphism in CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) affects CYP3A activity and the wild-type allele (CYP3A5*1) is in partial linkage with the CYP3A4*1B allele. We compared the genotype frequencies for the CYP3A5*3, the CYP3A4*1B and the NQO1609C-->T substitution in 224 children with ALL who did not develop t-ML (controls) and in 53 children with ALL who did develop the complication. The allele frequencies differed significantly among whites, blacks and Hispanics (P < 0.001 for CYP3A5*3, P < 0.001 for CYP3A4*1B and P = 0.004 for NQO1609), thus we performed the comparisons between ALL controls and t-ML patients after accounting for race. We found no differences in the CYP3A4*1B allele distribution between ALL controls and t-ML patients in whites (P = 0.339, 6.6% vs. 9.8%), blacks (P = 0.498, 93.8% vs. 87.5%) or Hispanics (P = 0.523, 39.1% vs. 25.0%).

We found no differences between the control and t-ML group in the incidence of homozygous CYP3A5*3 genotypes: 82.0% vs. 85.4% in whites (P = 0.403), 6.5% vs. 12.5% in blacks (P = 0.508), and 69.6% vs. 75.0% in Hispanics (P= 0.663).

A mathematical model of in vivo methotrexate accumulation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2002-09-24,"Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Interindividual differences in lymphoblast accumulation of MTX and its active metabolites, methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), may contribute to the effectiveness of treatment among ALL subtypes. To better understand these differences in MTXPG accumulation, we developed a model to characterize the cellular influx and efflux of MTX, formation of MTXPG by the addition of glutamyl residues catalyzed by FPGS (folylpolyglutamate synthetase), and cleavage of glutamyl residues from MTXPG by GGH (gamma-glutamyl hydrolase). The model was fitted to in vivo intracellular MTXPG concentrations measured serially in leukemic blasts from 20 newly diagnosed patients with ALL treated with 24-h intravenous infusions of MTX. The observed median concentrations of total MTXPG at 44 h was higher in B-lineage than in T-cell ALL (1706 vs 518 pmol/10(9) cells, P<0.025), consistent with the higher estimated Vmax for FPGS activity in B-lineage vs T-lineage blasts (414 vs 93 pmol/10(9) cells/h, P<0.008). Simulations based on the model-estimated parameters indicated greater accumulation of MTX, MTXPGs (MTXPG(2-7)) and total MTX (MTXPG(1-7)) with longer MTX infusions and with higher MTX doses, with the highest concentrations in hyperdiploid B-lineage, intermediate in non-hyperdiploid B-lineage, and lowest in T-cell ALL.

Advancing the treatment of hematologic malignancies through the development of targeted interventions.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2002-10-01,"Significant advances have been made in the development of targeted interventions for hematologic malignancies. Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathogenesis of human leukemias. Data indicate that nonrandom, somatically acquired translocations, inversions, and other abnormalities occur in many acute leukemias. In the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), targeted therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy leads to dramatic improvements in disease-free survival. Imatinib mesylate, a signal transduction inhibitor that inhibits tyrosine kinase activity, the protein product of the ABL proto-oncogene, has remarkable activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a promising class of agents that target multiple pathways including Ras proteins, are potential anticancer therapy for a wide range of malignancies, including leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). There also is evidence that recombinant human erythropoietin therapy (r-HuEPO) can benefit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. This supplement will discuss advances in our understanding of human leukemias, including the use of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies such as Campath-1H (Wellcome, Beckenham, UK, and Ilex Oncology, San Antonio, TX) and rituximab and immunoconjugates such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and BL-22.

A comparison of allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoblastic lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2002-11-27,"Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a rare, clinically aggressive neoplasm of the young that frequently involves the bone marrow (BM) and/or central nervous system. Because LBL is similar to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, some centers prefer allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (SC) transplantation to autologous SC transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for patients who underwent autologous (auto, n = 128) or HLA-identical sibling (allo, n = 76) SC transplantations from 1989 to 1998 and were reported to International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) or Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry (ABMTR). Allo stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients had higher treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months (18% versus 3%, P =.002), and this disadvantage persisted at 1 and 5 years. Early relapse rates after alloSC transplantation and autoSC transplantation were similar, but significantly lower relapse rates were observed in alloSCT recipients at 1 and 5 years (32% versus 46%, P =.05; and 34% versus 56%, P =.004, respectively). No differences were noted in lymphoma-free survival rates between alloSC transplantations and autoSC transplantations (5-year rates 36% versus 39%, P =.82). AutoSCT recipients had higher overall survival at 6 months (75% versus 59%, P =.01), but survival did not significantly differ between the 2 groups at 1 and 5 years (60% versus 49%, P =.09; 44% versus 39%, P =.47, respectively).

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol disrupts sodium butyrate-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and maturation while reciprocally potentiating apoptosis in human leukemia cells.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2002-02-01,"Interactions between the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol (FP) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) have been examined in human leukemia cells (U937) in relation to differentiation and apoptosis. Whereas 1 mM of SB or 100 nM of FP minimally induced apoptosis (4% and 10%, respectively) at 24 h, simultaneous exposure of U937 cells to these agents dramatically increased cell death (e.g., approximately 60%), reflected by both morphological and Annexin/propidium iodide-staining features, procaspase 3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Similar interactions were observed in human promyelocytic (HL-60), B-lymphoblastic (Raji), and T-lymphoblastic (Jurkat) leukemia cells. Coadministration of FP opposed SB-mediated accumulation of cells in G0G1 and differentiation, reflected by reduced CD11b expression, but instead dramatically increased procaspase-3, procaspase-8, Bid, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, as well as mitochondrial damage (e.g., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release). FP also blocked SB-related p21WAF1-CIP1 induction through a caspase-independent mechanism and triggered the caspase-mediated cleavage of p27KIP1 and retinoblastoma protein. The latter event was accompanied by a marked reduction in retinoblastoma protein/E2F1 complex formation. However, FP did not modify the extent of SB-associated acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Treatment of cells with FP/SB also resulted in the caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 and caspase-independent down-regulation of Mcl-1. Levels of cyclins A, D1, and E, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis also declined in SB/FP-treated cells. Finally, FP/SB coexposure potently induced apoptosis in two primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples. Together, these findings demonstrate that FP, when combined with SB, induces multiple perturbations in cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, which oppose leukemic cell differentiation but instead promote mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.",Journal Article,6563.0,68.0,Interactions cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol FP histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate SB examined human leukemia U937 relation differentiation apoptosis 1 mM SB 100 nM FP minimally induced apoptosis 4 10 respectively 24 h simultaneous exposure U937 agents dramatically increased death e.g. approximately 60 reflected morphological Annexin/propidium iodide-staining features procaspase 3 activation poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage Similar interactions observed human promyelocytic HL-60 B-lymphoblastic Raji T-lymphoblastic Jurkat leukemia Coadministration FP opposed SB-mediated accumulation G0G1 differentiation reflected reduced CD11b expression instead dramatically increased procaspase-3 procaspase-8 Bid poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage mitochondrial damage e.g. loss mitochondrial membrane potential cytochrome c release FP blocked SB-related p21WAF1-CIP1 induction caspase-independent mechanism triggered caspase-mediated cleavage p27KIP1 retinoblastoma event accompanied marked reduction retinoblastoma protein/E2F1 complex formation FP modify extent SB-associated acetylation histones H3 H4 Treatment FP/SB resulted caspase-mediated cleavage Bcl-2 caspase-independent down-regulation Mcl-1 Levels cyclins D1 E X-linked inhibitor apoptosis declined SB/FP-treated Finally FP/SB coexposure potently induced apoptosis primary acute myelogenous leukemia findings demonstrate FP combined SB induces multiple perturbations cycle apoptosis regulatory oppose leukemic differentiation instead promote mitochondrial damage apoptosis,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1286, 59, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 3030, 6434, 2, 3, 1508, 2732, 230, 4682, 12285, 5343, 47, 85, 409, 4, 171, 37, 7000, 4, 2191, 6, 910, 2, 351, 547, 14, 321, 1, 5343, 15, 394, 2878, 1, 6434, 2144, 277, 351, 39, 2, 79, 106, 28, 259, 555, 2824, 645, 1, 7000, 37, 6, 46, 183, 2729, 101, 31, 273, 563, 499, 705, 335, 4686, 20, 110, 4268, 2, 4850, 10839, 8456, 1029, 404, 10153, 27, 363, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 288, 1286, 11, 164, 4, 171, 4300, 1718, 335, 132, 1275, 9868, 2, 102, 1275, 8433, 37, 5777, 1, 6434, 6101, 5343, 517, 1835, 1, 37, 4, 53278, 2, 910, 4686, 20, 405, 6861, 55, 84, 3496, 2729, 101, 10153, 27, 10153, 66, 2793, 2, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 3155, 22, 149, 22, 2019, 1350, 563, 499, 407, 1, 2019, 1905, 174, 2, 4155, 256, 2008, 6434, 120, 2582, 5343, 139, 18838, 6927, 504, 298, 8, 1469, 306, 670, 2, 4173, 3, 1469, 517, 3155, 1, 11581, 2, 178, 3, 3286, 774, 10, 2756, 20, 8, 2003, 628, 4, 178, 6112, 840, 1264, 137, 6434, 205, 44, 4289, 3, 1039, 1, 5343, 41, 4145, 1, 8457, 3739, 2, 7812, 24, 1, 37, 5, 6434, 5343, 120, 627, 4, 3, 1469, 517, 3155, 1, 1044, 18, 2, 1469, 306, 1328, 863, 1, 1308, 14, 148, 1, 10149, 8, 2146, 2, 563, 2, 1006, 1199, 230, 1, 351, 120, 3054, 4, 5343, 6434, 73, 37, 1368, 6434, 5343, 21094, 4684, 277, 351, 4, 100, 86, 286, 2194, 347, 1162, 46, 272, 608, 17, 6434, 198, 397, 5, 5343, 1516, 232, 7013, 4, 31, 417, 2, 351, 1253, 652, 92, 26089, 2015, 31, 910, 84, 3496, 1617, 2019, 1350, 2, 351]",1923.0,12467221,cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol disrupts sodium butyrate-induced p21WAF1/CIP1 expression maturation reciprocally potentiating apoptosis human leukemia,1,0.001092896174863388

Simple rules underlying gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients.,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",Bioinformatics,2003-01-01,"For classifying gene expression profiles or other types of medical data, simple rules are preferable to non-linear distance or kernel functions. This is because rules may help us understand more about the application in addition to performing an accurate classification. In this paper, we discover novel rules that describe the gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. We also introduce a new classifier, named PCL, to make effective use of the rules. PCL is accurate and can handle multiple parallel classifications. We evaluate this method by classifying 327 heterogeneous ALL samples. Our test error rate is competitive to that of support vector machines, and it is 71% better than C4.5, 50% better than Naive Bayes, and 43% better than k-nearest neighbour.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and the risk of secondary myeloid malignancy after etoposide treatment.,Blood,Blood,2003-01-16,"Event-free survival for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) now exceeds 80% in the most effective trials. Failures are due to relapse, toxicity, and second cancers such as therapy-related myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia (t-ML). Topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylators can induce t-ML; additional risk factors for t-ML remain poorly defined. The occurrence of t-ML among children who had received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) following ALL remission induction therapy prompted us to examine this and other putative risk factors for t-ML in 412 children treated on 2 consecutive ALL protocols from 1991 to 1998. All children received etoposide and anthracyclines, 99 of whom received G-CSF; 284 also received cyclophosphamide, 58 of whom also received cranial irradiation. There were 20 children who developed t-ML at a median of 2.3 years (range, 1.0-6.0 years), including 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 3 myelodysplasia, and 1 chronic myeloid leukemia.

"N-(4-Hydroxylphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide, 4-HPR), a retinoid compound with antileukemic and proapoptotic activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2003-03-01,"Retinoids have been shown to regulate vital cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-all-trans-retinamide (fenretinide, 4-HPR) is a synthetic ATRA derivative with chemopreventive and cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines including myeloid leukemia. Although several modes of action have been postulated, its mechanism of action in hematologic malignancies remains unclear. Furthermore, only limited information exists as to its activity in lymphoid malignancies. To test whether 4-HPR has activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we first analyzed its antiproliferative effect in five ALL (Z-33, Z-138, Z-119, Z-181, and Jurkat) cell lines. We found that 4-HPR inhibited the proliferation of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 microM. We further demonstrated by cell cycle analysis that 5 microM of 4-HPR blocked Z-119 cells in S phase thus preventing their progression through the cycle. Next we tested whether 4-HPR activated the caspase pathway and induced apoptotic cell death. We found that 4-HPR induced apoptosis in Z-119 cells through the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We then asked whether 4-HPR could affect fresh ALL progenitor cells. Therefore, we obtained bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from five patients with newly diagnosed ALL and tested the effect of 4-HPR using the ALL blast colony culture assay. To supplement our results, we also performed the ALL blast assay on one ALL cell line (ALL-1). We found that 4-HPR significantly inhibited ALL colony-forming cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Our data show that 4-HPR is a potent inhibitor of ALL cell proliferation and that it induces in vitro apoptotic cell death in ALL blasts. Further studies are warranted to establish the in vivo effect of 4-HPR particularly in patients with ALL.",Journal Article,6170.0,26.0,Retinoids shown regulate vital cellular processes including proliferation differentiation apoptosis N- 4-Hydroxyphenyl -all-trans-retinamide fenretinide 4-HPR synthetic ATRA derivative chemopreventive cytotoxic activity lines including myeloid leukemia modes action postulated mechanism action hematologic malignancies remains unclear Furthermore limited information exists activity lymphoid malignancies test 4-HPR activity acute lymphoblastic leukemia antiproliferative effect Z-33 Z-138 Z-119 Z-181 Jurkat lines 4-HPR inhibited proliferation lines dose-dependent manner concentrations ranging 1 10 microM demonstrated cycle 5 microM 4-HPR blocked Z-119 phase preventing progression cycle tested 4-HPR activated caspase pathway induced apoptotic death 4-HPR induced apoptosis Z-119 activation caspase-3 subsequent cleavage substrate poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP asked 4-HPR affect fresh progenitor obtained bone marrow peripheral blood patients newly diagnosed tested effect 4-HPR blast colony culture supplement performed blast line ALL-1 4-HPR significantly inhibited colony-forming proliferation dose-dependent manner 4-HPR potent inhibitor proliferation induces vitro apoptotic death blasts studies warranted establish vivo effect 4-HPR particularly patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7358, 47, 85, 443, 6, 2288, 3511, 763, 1849, 141, 31, 457, 910, 2, 351, 78, 39, 26107, 62, 3437, 28004, 10062, 39, 14154, 16, 8, 3273, 2822, 4819, 5, 4401, 2, 759, 128, 480, 747, 12, 31, 285, 141, 533, 242, 392, 8256, 1, 1578, 47, 85, 6507, 211, 670, 1, 1578, 4, 813, 441, 469, 1200, 798, 158, 383, 487, 2481, 22, 6, 211, 128, 4, 2303, 441, 6, 412, 317, 39, 14154, 71, 128, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 21, 157, 311, 211, 3669, 254, 4, 365, 62, 3905, 466, 3905, 4478, 3905, 4299, 3905, 5540, 2, 8433, 31, 285, 21, 204, 17, 39, 14154, 879, 3, 457, 1, 62, 31, 285, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 28, 1003, 2223, 29, 14, 6, 79, 3550, 21, 195, 264, 20, 31, 417, 65, 17, 33, 3550, 1, 39, 14154, 2582, 3905, 4299, 37, 4, 695, 124, 631, 3017, 136, 91, 298, 3, 417, 1305, 21, 650, 317, 39, 14154, 735, 3, 1469, 308, 2, 277, 1631, 31, 273, 21, 204, 17, 39, 14154, 277, 351, 4, 3905, 4299, 37, 298, 3, 363, 1, 1469, 27, 2, 706, 3155, 1, 211, 4235, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2041, 21, 818, 3732, 317, 39, 14154, 359, 1158, 4329, 62, 2520, 37, 673, 21, 683, 581, 2, 672, 315, 37, 29, 365, 7, 5, 732, 265, 62, 2, 650, 3, 254, 1, 39, 14154, 75, 3, 62, 3112, 1975, 2099, 719, 6, 5836, 114, 99, 21, 120, 173, 3, 62, 3112, 719, 23, 104, 62, 31, 328, 62, 14, 21, 204, 17, 39, 14154, 97, 879, 62, 1975, 4525, 31, 457, 4, 8, 61, 470, 1708, 114, 74, 514, 17, 39, 14154, 16, 8, 1157, 230, 1, 62, 31, 457, 2, 17, 192, 1516, 4, 439, 1631, 31, 273, 4, 62, 2438, 195, 94, 32, 1197, 6, 1811, 3, 4, 386, 254, 1, 39, 14154, 823, 4, 7, 5, 62]",1911.0,12537979,N- 4-Hydroxylphenyl retinamide fenretinide 4-HPR retinoid compound antileukemic proapoptotic activity acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Specific homeodomain-DNA interactions are required for HOX11-mediated transformation.,Blood,Blood,2003-02-13,"HOX11 encodes a homeodomain protein that is aberrantly expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a consequence of the t(10;14) and t(7;10) chromosomal translocations. We previously reported that HOX11 immortalizes murine hematopoietic progenitors and induces pre-T-cell tumors in mice after long latency. It has been demonstrated in a number of studies that HOX11, similar to other homeodomain proteins, binds DNA and transactivates transcription. These findings suggest that translocation-activated HOX11 functions as an oncogenic transcription factor. Here we report that HOX11 represses transcription through both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. Interestingly, transcriptional repression by HOX11 is independent of its DNA binding capability. Moreover, a systematic mutational analysis indicated that repressor activity was separable from immortalizing function, which requires certain residues within the HOX11 homeodomain that make base-specific or phosphate-backbone contacts with DNA. We further showed that the pathologic action of HOX11 involves DNA binding-dependent transcriptional pathways that are distinct from those controlling expression of a chromosomal target gene (Aldh-1). We conclude that dysregulated expression of a particular set of downstream target genes by DNA binding via the homeodomain is of central importance for leukemia initiation mediated by HOX11.",Journal Article,6186.0,26.0,HOX11 encodes homeodomain aberrantly expressed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia consequence 10 14 7 10 chromosomal translocations previously reported HOX11 immortalizes murine hematopoietic progenitors induces pre-T-cell mice long latency demonstrated number studies HOX11 similar homeodomain binds DNA transactivates transcription findings suggest translocation-activated HOX11 functions oncogenic transcription factor report HOX11 represses transcription TATA-containing TATA-less promoters Interestingly transcriptional repression HOX11 independent DNA binding capability systematic indicated repressor activity separable immortalizing function requires certain residues HOX11 homeodomain base-specific phosphate-backbone contacts DNA showed pathologic action HOX11 involves DNA binding-dependent transcriptional pathways distinct controlling expression chromosomal target Aldh-1 conclude dysregulated expression particular set downstream target DNA binding homeodomain central importance leukemia initiation mediated HOX11,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[18191, 4322, 8, 18140, 178, 17, 16, 5619, 570, 4, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 22, 8, 4177, 1, 3, 102, 79, 213, 2, 102, 67, 79, 1860, 3262, 21, 373, 210, 17, 18191, 53378, 1471, 1007, 4321, 2, 1516, 671, 102, 31, 57, 4, 399, 50, 319, 5301, 192, 71, 85, 264, 4, 8, 207, 1, 94, 17, 18191, 288, 6, 127, 18140, 652, 3333, 261, 2, 20148, 866, 46, 272, 309, 17, 2006, 735, 18191, 1681, 22, 35, 1302, 866, 161, 467, 21, 414, 17, 18191, 10946, 866, 298, 110, 23096, 1101, 2, 23096, 299, 4347, 2873, 1431, 5255, 20, 18191, 16, 306, 1, 211, 261, 791, 6188, 1393, 8, 1556, 1619, 65, 1103, 17, 7434, 128, 10, 26095, 29, 53379, 343, 92, 1706, 1840, 6418, 262, 3, 18191, 18140, 17, 2378, 1782, 112, 15, 4849, 7066, 13291, 5, 261, 21, 195, 224, 17, 3, 510, 1578, 1, 18191, 2921, 261, 791, 470, 1431, 460, 17, 32, 834, 29, 135, 1893, 55, 1, 8, 1860, 283, 145, 6409, 14, 21, 2060, 17, 4288, 55, 1, 8, 1454, 916, 1, 1489, 283, 214, 20, 261, 791, 847, 3, 18140, 16, 1, 854, 1187, 9, 1118, 517, 20, 18191]",1366.0,12586625,Specific homeodomain-DNA interactions required HOX11-mediated transformation,4,0.004371584699453552
Characterization of the MLL partner gene AF15q14 involved in t(11;15)(q23;q14).,Oncogene,Oncogene,2003-03-01,"Translocations interrupting the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) occur in 7-10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5-6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. One of these translocations, t(11;15)(q23;q14), occurs rarely in both ALL and AML. The gene on chromosome 15, AF15q14, was cloned recently in a patient with AML-M4. We have identified the same gene in a de novo T-ALL patient. However, both the MLL and AF15q14 breakpoints in these patients differed: in the previously reported AML-M4, both gene breaks were within exons, while in our ALL case the MLL break is intronic and the AF15q14 break is exonic. The MLL-AF15q14 fusion described previously shares no AF15q14 residues in common with the chimera reported here. The fusion proteins also differ with respect to MLL--the previously described fusion contains 55 extra amino acids as its MLL break is in exon 11, while the chimera we report breaks in intron 9. Contrary to the originally described normal AF15q14 (5925-bp cDNA encoding a 1833-aa protein), we identify a 7542-bp cDNA and a 2342-aa AF15q14 protein.

Inhibition of FLT3 in MLL. Validation of a therapeutic target identified by gene expression based classification.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2003-02-01,"We recently found that MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemias (MLL) have a unique gene expression profile including high level expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. We hypothesized that FLT3 might be a therapeutic target in MLL and found that 5 of 30 MLLs contain mutations in the activation loop of FLT3 that result in constitutive activation. Three are a newly described deletion of I836 and the others are D835 mutations.

Lineage specific treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission with anti-B4-blocked ricin or high-dose cytarabine: Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study 9311.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-03-01,"Anti-B4-blocked ricin is an immunotoxin comprised of an anti-CD19 murine monoclonal antibody (B4) conjugated to blocked ricin, which has cytotoxic activity in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Adults with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a previously developed and tested chemotherapeutic regimen. Patients with CD19 positive ALL were given anti-B4-blocked ricin as 2 7-day continuous infusions 1 week apart. Patients with CD19 negative ALL received high-dose cytarabine. Serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of BCR-ABL, immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH), and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes were used to measure the impact of lineage specific intensification treatment on minimal residual disease. Eighty-two adults were enrolled, and 78 were eligible. The median age was 34 years (range, 17-81 years). Sixty-six patients (85%) achieved complete remission. Forty-six patients received the anti-B4-blocked ricin, which generally was well tolerated; 80% were able to receive both courses. The most common toxicity was asymptomatic transient elevation of liver function tests in 72% of patients. Lymphopenia occurred in 46% of patients. Two patients developed antibodies to the anti-B4-blocked ricin. Molecular monitoring before and after the experimental course of intensification did not show a consistent change in the number of leukemia cells remaining, and the immediate posttreatment PCR studies did not correlate with remission duration. Intensification therapy with anti-B4-blocked ricin is feasible for patients with CD19 positive ALL, although there is little evidence of an additional clinical benefit from the anti-B4-blocked ricin.

Gene expression signatures in MLL-rearranged T-lineage and B-precursor acute leukemias: dominance of HOX dysregulation.,Blood,Blood,2003-03-13,"Rearrangements of the MLL locus, located on human chromosome 11q23, are frequent in both infant and therapy-related leukemias. Gene expression analysis of MLL-rearranged B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (MLL B-ALLs) has identified these cases as a unique subtype of leukemia, characterized by the expression of genes associated with both lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic lineages. Here we show that MLL fusions also generate a distinct genetic subtype of T-lineage ALL (MLL T-ALL), in which leukemic cells are characterized by an early arrest in thymocyte differentiation, with suggestive evidence of commitment to the gammadelta lineage. Interestingly, multiple genes linked to cell proliferation (eg, PCNA, MYC, CDK2, and POLA) were down-regulated in MLL-fusion samples, relative to those transformed by other T-ALL oncogenes (P <.000 001, Fisher exact test). Overall, MLL T-ALL cases consistently demonstrated increased levels of expression of a subset of major HOX genes--HOXA9, HOXA10, and HOXC6--and the MEIS1 HOX coregulator (P <.008, one-sided Wilcoxon test), a pattern of gene expression that was reiterated in MLL B-ALLs. However, expression of myeloid lineage genes, previously reported in MLL B-ALLs, was not identified in T-lineage cases with this abnormality, suggesting that myeloid gene dysregulation is dispensable in leukemic transformation mediated by MLL fusion proteins. Our findings implicate dysregulation of HOX gene family members as a dominant mechanism of leukemic transformation induced by chimeric MLL oncogenes.",Journal Article,6158.0,235.0,Rearrangements MLL locus located human chromosome 11q23 frequent infant therapy-related leukemias expression MLL-rearranged B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias MLL B-ALLs identified cases unique subtype leukemia characterized expression associated lymphoid myeloid hematopoietic lineages MLL fusions generate distinct genetic subtype T-lineage MLL T-ALL leukemic characterized early arrest thymocyte differentiation suggestive evidence commitment gammadelta lineage Interestingly multiple linked proliferation PCNA MYC CDK2 POLA down-regulated MLL-fusion relative transformed T-ALL oncogenes P .000 001 Fisher exact test Overall MLL T-ALL cases consistently demonstrated increased levels expression subset major HOX -- HOXA9 HOXA10 HOXC6 -- MEIS1 HOX coregulator P .008 one-sided Wilcoxon test pattern expression reiterated MLL B-ALLs expression myeloid lineage previously reported MLL B-ALLs identified T-lineage cases abnormality suggesting myeloid dysregulation dispensable leukemic transformation mediated MLL fusion findings implicate dysregulation HOX family members dominant mechanism leukemic transformation induced chimeric MLL oncogenes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2072, 1, 3, 3049, 2474, 2308, 23, 171, 1170, 7975, 32, 908, 4, 110, 8027, 2, 36, 139, 2792, 145, 55, 65, 1, 3049, 3201, 132, 2765, 286, 1275, 2792, 3049, 132, 10706, 71, 108, 46, 140, 22, 8, 991, 875, 1, 765, 20, 3, 55, 1, 214, 41, 5, 110, 2303, 2, 533, 1007, 7234, 467, 21, 514, 17, 3049, 2530, 120, 2562, 8, 834, 336, 875, 1, 102, 2542, 62, 3049, 102, 62, 4, 92, 2015, 37, 32, 765, 20, 35, 191, 1854, 4, 16236, 910, 5, 3832, 241, 1, 11082, 6, 3, 43192, 2542, 2873, 232, 214, 1199, 6, 31, 457, 2887, 8220, 1371, 4547, 2, 53426, 11, 1328, 1065, 4, 3049, 1212, 347, 580, 6, 135, 2423, 20, 127, 102, 62, 3326, 19, 984, 144, 3135, 2472, 412, 63, 3049, 102, 62, 140, 2433, 264, 101, 148, 1, 55, 1, 8, 697, 1, 458, 14722, 214, 11453, 19553, 2, 37413, 2, 3, 18256, 14722, 30380, 19, 2155, 104, 1689, 3896, 412, 8, 1177, 1, 145, 55, 17, 10, 30381, 4, 3049, 132, 10706, 137, 55, 1, 533, 2542, 214, 373, 210, 4, 3049, 132, 10706, 10, 44, 108, 4, 102, 2542, 140, 5, 26, 3698, 802, 17, 533, 145, 3935, 16, 15142, 4, 2015, 1392, 517, 20, 3049, 1212, 652, 114, 272, 5545, 3935, 1, 14722, 145, 607, 1684, 22, 8, 2156, 670, 1, 2015, 1392, 277, 20, 2897, 3049, 3326]",1507.0,12637319,expression signatures MLL-rearranged T-lineage B-precursor acute leukemias dominance HOX dysregulation,1,0.001092896174863388

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral etoposide in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"To study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once- versus twice-daily oral etoposide in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifty-eight patients were randomly assigned to etoposide at 50 mg/m(2)/d with once- versus twice-daily doses for 22 days. On day 8, vincristine, asparaginase, and dexamethasone were started. Etoposide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were studied for 47, 28, and 26 patients on day 1, 8, and 22, respectively, of remission reinduction therapy. Of 48 patients with pharmacokinetic data, 42 (87.5%) achieved complete remission, three (6.3%) failed to achieve remission, and three (6.3%) died during induction. Median etoposide day 8 area under concentration-time curve (AUC) and cumulative AUC tended to be greater (P =.06 and P =.07, respectively) in patients (n = 23) who achieved complete remission (24 and 522 micro mol/L x h, respectively) than in patients (n = 3) who did not (14 and 303 micro mol/L x h, respectively).

Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"To determine whether adult survivors (>or= 18 years of age) of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at increased risk for obesity and to assess patient and treatment variables that influence risk. A retrospective cohort of participants of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study was used to compare 1,765 adult survivors of childhood ALL to 2,565 adult siblings of childhood cancer survivors. Body-mass index (BMI; kilograms per square meter), calculated from self-reported heights and weights, was used to determine the prevalence of being overweight (BMI, 25-29.9) or obese (BMI >or= 30.0). Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for being overweight or obese among ALL survivors relative to the sibling control group. The age- and race-adjusted OR for being obese in survivors treated with cranial radiation doses >or= 20 Gy in comparison with siblings was 2.59 for females (95% CI, 1.88 to 3.55; P <.001) and 1.86 for males (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.57; P <.001). The OR for obesity was greatest among females diagnosed at 0 to 4 years of age and treated with radiation doses >or= 20 Gy (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.34 to 5.99; P <.001). Obesity was not associated with treatment consisting of chemotherapy only or with cranial radiation doses of 10 to 19 Gy.

Recombinant urate oxidase for prevention of hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome in lymphoid malignancies.,Clinical lymphoma,Clin Lymphoma,2003-03-01,"Hyperuricemia is a common manifestation of lymphoid malignancies at diagnosis or after the start of chemotherapy. When accompanied by other metabolic abnormalities and/or organ failure, hyperuricemia may be a manifestation of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Patients at particularly high risk of such complications include those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conventional measures to prevent hyperuricemia and TLS are comprised of hydration, alkalinization of body fluids, and administration of allopurinol. Although these measures are usually effective in preventing or managing hyperuricemia, approximately 20% of patients at high risk of TLS require dialysis, and many cannot receive chemotherapy as planned.

Five children with ALL who were enrolled in POG B-precursor or T-cell ALL protocols from 1994 to 1999 subsequently were determined to have CMT hereditary neuropathy. Their clinical presentations and treatment records were reviewed in detail. Records of all patients entered on POG 9201 (lesser-risk ALL) were reviewed to identify all cases of significant vincristine toxicity noted in the first 6 months of treatment. The five identified patients all had substantial peripheral neurotoxicity that required alteration in treatment and/or orthopedic/physical therapy evaluation and follow-up. The POG 9201 review identified 25 of 686 patients (3.6%) with significant peripheral neuropathy. Three of 25 were diagnosed with CMT; the others have had no testing reported. A family history of CMT or other peripheral neuropathy should be sought at the time of diagnosis of ALL. Testing for CMT should be considered in any child with substantial vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. Treatment of such patients must be individualized.

Molecular monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid can predict clinical relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2003-05-01,"In a patient with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with eosinophilia that completely responded to induction chemotherapy, we assayed serial remission cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow specimens for minimal residual disease using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to assess for clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene cluster (IGH) gene rearrangement. Cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia and minimal residual disease were detected on day 406, preceding the morphologic diagnosis of central nervous system relapse on day 578. By day 841, the bone marrow had 35% blasts. Despite aggressive therapy, including unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation, the patient developed testicular and bone marrow relapses and died of disease. We conclude that increasing levels of minimal residual disease in cerebrospinal fluid can predict recurrence of ALL prior to clinical and morphologic relapse. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel translocation in this tumor, the t(5;9)(q31;p24), that possibly led to fusion of the interleukin-3 (IL3) (5q31) and JAK2 (9p24) genes and may explain the concomitant appearance of eosinophilia and ALL.",Case Reports,6109.0,19.0,patient precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated eosinophilia completely responded induction chemotherapy assayed serial remission cerebrospinal fluid bone marrow specimens minimal residual disease quantitative polymerase chain reaction assess clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain cluster IGH rearrangement Cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia minimal residual disease detected day 406 preceding morphologic diagnosis central nervous relapse day 578 day 841 bone marrow 35 blasts Despite aggressive therapy including unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation patient developed testicular bone marrow relapses died disease conclude increasing levels minimal residual disease cerebrospinal fluid predict recurrence prior clinical morphologic relapse Furthermore demonstrate novel translocation 5 9 q31 p24 possibly led fusion interleukin-3 IL3 5q31 JAK2 9p24 explain concomitant appearance eosinophilia,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 8, 69, 5, 2765, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 62, 41, 5, 13555, 17, 2500, 2211, 6, 504, 56, 21, 4499, 2108, 734, 5156, 2357, 2, 581, 623, 9, 1048, 753, 34, 75, 8, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 6, 423, 9, 3910, 112, 2593, 4013, 1260, 145, 3132, 5221, 145, 2675, 5156, 2357, 13555, 2, 1048, 753, 34, 11, 530, 23, 218, 8522, 5892, 3, 2815, 147, 1, 854, 1880, 398, 429, 23, 218, 10431, 20, 218, 18269, 3, 581, 42, 465, 2438, 550, 571, 36, 141, 2092, 5998, 1885, 315, 497, 3, 69, 276, 2, 581, 3713, 2, 1016, 1, 34, 21, 2060, 17, 602, 148, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 4, 5156, 2357, 122, 678, 146, 1, 62, 324, 6, 38, 2, 2815, 429, 798, 21, 608, 8, 229, 2006, 4, 26, 30, 3, 102, 33, 83, 53499, 43136, 17, 2150, 836, 6, 1212, 1, 3, 1603, 27, 20283, 22069, 2, 2509, 10450, 214, 2, 68, 2943, 3, 1781, 3592, 1, 13555, 2, 62]",1116.0,12708906,Molecular monitoring cerebrospinal fluid predict clinical relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia eosinophilia,0,0.0
Trends in leukemia incidence and survival in the United States (1973-1998).,Cancer,Cancer,2003-05-01,"It is estimated that each year, approximately 30,800 individuals will be diagnosed with leukemia in the United States and 21,700 individuals will die of the disease. Although the overall incidence of leukemia has been declining in the United States, recent reports suggest that incidence rates may be increasing for certain age and racial groups. Leukemia incidence (including acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia [CLL]) and 5-year survival rates were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Specific rates for age (birth-19, 20-44, 45-64, and 65 + years), gender, and race (black, white) were also examined. A total of 66,404 cases of leukemia were identified for the period 1973-1998 in the nine reporting SEER sites. For children younger than 20 years old, the overall incidence rate of leukemia increased significantly (estimated annual percent change [EAPC] = 0.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.9), whereas the rate decreased significantly among the group 65 years and older (EAPC = - 0.3, 95% CI = - 0.5 to - 0.1). Incidence rates for CLL and CML decreased significantly during this time period, whereas incidence rates for AML remained stable. Children younger than 20 years old experienced a 15% increase in the 5-year survival rates for both ALL and AML when comparing the two 10-year periods of 1974-1983 and 1984-1993. In contrast, there was little overall improvement in survival for adults 45 years and older. In particular, there was a notable decrease in the overall 5-year survival for blacks older than 65 years and for black males older than 44 years. Although the current study confirmed some of the results noted in other populations, the observed overall decline in leukemia survival for blacks is surprising and warrants further investigation.",Comparative Study,6109.0,165.0,"estimated year approximately 30,800 individuals diagnosed leukemia United States 21,700 individuals die disease overall incidence leukemia declining United States recent reports suggest incidence rates increasing certain age racial groups Leukemia incidence including acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia AML chronic myeloid leukemia CML chronic lymphoblastic leukemia CLL 5-year survival rates obtained Surveillance Epidemiology End SEER program Specific rates age birth-19 20-44 45-64 65 years gender race black white examined total 66,404 cases leukemia identified period 1973-1998 reporting SEER sites children younger 20 years old overall incidence rate leukemia increased significantly estimated annual percent change EAPC 0.5 95 confidence interval CI 0.1-0.9 rate decreased significantly group 65 years older EAPC 0.3 95 CI 0.5 0.1 Incidence rates CLL CML decreased significantly time period incidence rates AML remained stable Children younger 20 years old experienced 15 increase 5-year survival rates AML comparing 10-year periods 1974-1983 1984-1993 contrast little overall improvement survival adults 45 years older particular notable decrease overall 5-year survival blacks older 65 years black males older 44 years current confirmed noted populations observed overall decline leukemia survival blacks surprising warrants investigation",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[192, 16, 661, 17, 296, 111, 705, 201, 2796, 869, 303, 40, 265, 5, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 2, 239, 5692, 869, 303, 3384, 1, 3, 34, 242, 3, 63, 287, 1, 71, 85, 6896, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 435, 1198, 309, 17, 287, 151, 68, 40, 602, 9, 1840, 89, 2, 2257, 271, 287, 141, 286, 1275, 62, 286, 533, 329, 442, 533, 903, 2, 442, 1275, 552, 2, 33, 111, 25, 151, 11, 683, 29, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 1243, 112, 151, 9, 89, 3809, 326, 179, 584, 512, 660, 2, 556, 60, 1632, 2, 1047, 1445, 886, 11, 120, 409, 8, 181, 1, 700, 10315, 140, 1, 11, 108, 9, 3, 727, 4756, 1850, 4, 3, 762, 1760, 1605, 633, 9, 541, 773, 76, 179, 60, 1095, 3, 63, 287, 116, 1, 101, 97, 661, 2114, 714, 707, 22097, 13, 33, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 14, 13, 83, 547, 3, 116, 340, 97, 107, 3, 87, 556, 60, 2, 434, 22097, 13, 27, 48, 58, 13, 33, 6, 13, 14, 287, 151, 9, 552, 2, 903, 340, 97, 190, 26, 98, 727, 547, 287, 151, 9, 329, 958, 585, 541, 773, 76, 179, 60, 1095, 592, 8, 167, 344, 4, 3, 33, 111, 25, 151, 9, 110, 62, 2, 329, 198, 1430, 3, 100, 79, 111, 3338, 1, 10201, 6656, 2, 6036, 3343, 4, 748, 125, 10, 1215, 63, 767, 4, 25, 9, 857, 512, 60, 2, 434, 4, 1454, 125, 10, 8, 4090, 775, 4, 3, 63, 33, 111, 25, 9, 3544, 434, 76, 556, 60, 2, 9, 1445, 2296, 434, 76, 584, 60, 242, 3, 291, 45, 557, 476, 1, 3, 99, 1051, 4, 127, 1184, 3, 164, 63, 1858, 4, 25, 9, 3544, 16, 14157, 2, 2782, 195, 940]",1741.0,12712476,Trends leukemia incidence survival United States 1973-1998,28,0.030601092896174863
Classification of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling.,Blood,Blood,2003-05-01,"Contemporary treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) requires the assignment of patients to specific risk groups. We have recently demonstrated that expression profiling of leukemic blasts can accurately identify the known prognostic subtypes of ALL, including T-cell lineage ALL (T-ALL), E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, MLL rearrangements, BCR-ABL, and hyperdiploid karyotypes with more than 50 chromosomes. As the next step toward developing this methodology into a frontline diagnostic tool, we have now analyzed leukemic blasts from 132 diagnostic samples using higher density oligonucleotide arrays that allow the interrogation of most of the identified genes in the human genome. Nearly 60% of the newly identified subtype discriminating genes are novel markers not identified in our previous study, and thus should provide new insights into the altered biology underlying these leukemias. Moreover, a proportion of the newly selected genes are highly ranked as class discriminators, and when incorporated into class-predicting algorithms resulted in an overall diagnostic accuracy of 97%. The performance of an array containing the identified discriminating genes should now be assessed in frontline clinical trials in order to determine the accuracy, practicality, and cost effectiveness of this methodology in the clinical setting.",Journal Article,6109.0,434.0,Contemporary treatment pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia requires assignment patients specific risk groups recently demonstrated expression profiling leukemic blasts accurately identify known prognostic subtypes including T-cell lineage T-ALL E2A-PBX1 TEL-AML1 MLL rearrangements BCR-ABL hyperdiploid karyotypes 50 chromosomes step developing methodology frontline diagnostic tool leukemic blasts 132 diagnostic higher density oligonucleotide arrays allow interrogation identified human genome Nearly 60 newly identified subtype discriminating novel markers identified previous provide new insights altered underlying leukemias proportion newly selected highly ranked class discriminators incorporated class-predicting algorithms resulted overall diagnostic accuracy 97 performance array containing identified discriminating assessed frontline clinical trials order determine accuracy practicality cost effectiveness methodology clinical setting,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2667, 24, 1, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 1706, 3, 4392, 1, 7, 6, 112, 43, 271, 21, 47, 761, 264, 17, 55, 1080, 1, 2015, 2438, 122, 2141, 255, 3, 440, 177, 814, 1, 62, 141, 102, 31, 2542, 62, 102, 62, 15127, 14434, 8573, 6535, 3049, 2072, 1062, 1425, 2, 8847, 6809, 5, 80, 76, 212, 3560, 22, 3, 1305, 2458, 1317, 931, 26, 3209, 237, 8, 3171, 752, 1515, 21, 47, 1134, 311, 2015, 2438, 29, 4255, 752, 347, 75, 142, 1263, 4727, 3923, 17, 1700, 3, 8956, 1, 96, 1, 3, 108, 214, 4, 3, 171, 898, 1857, 335, 1, 3, 732, 108, 875, 8059, 214, 32, 229, 525, 44, 108, 4, 114, 698, 45, 2, 631, 257, 377, 217, 1957, 237, 3, 1495, 891, 1181, 46, 2792, 1393, 8, 920, 1, 3, 732, 715, 214, 32, 561, 6441, 22, 1040, 37447, 2, 198, 2449, 237, 1040, 1434, 3529, 627, 4, 35, 63, 752, 1190, 1, 1015, 3, 528, 1, 35, 1926, 1101, 3, 108, 8059, 214, 257, 1134, 40, 275, 4, 3171, 38, 143, 4, 1732, 6, 223, 3, 1190, 23220, 2, 835, 1236, 1, 26, 3209, 4, 3, 38, 546]",1313.0,12730115,Classification pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia expression profiling,16,0.017486338797814208
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a feasibility study.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2003-05-01,"Numerous studies have reported the feasibility of performing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced-intensity conditioning, although results in individual diseases are scarce, with no studies in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to analyze the results of reduced intensity conditioning for allografts in adult patients with ALL. We report the results of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 27 adult patients with high-risk ALL who were included in four prospective studies. The median age was 50 years; 23 (85%) patients were beyond first complete remission, 44% were chemorefractory and 41% were Philadelphia chromosome positive. Donors were mismatched related donors or volunteer unrelated donors in 12 cases (44%). The incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 48%, and 13 of 18 evaluable patients (72%) developed chronic GVHD. Currently nine patients are alive, with a median follow-up of 809 days (range, 381-1375). The 2-year incidence of transplant-related mortality was 23% (95% CI, 11% to 46%), and the 2-year probability of overall survival was 31% (95% CI, 12 to 48%), while the 2-year incidence of disease progression was 49% (95% CI, 33% to 72%). The 2-year incidence of disease progression in patients with and without GVHD was 35% (95% CI, 19% to 57%) and 70% (95% CI, 47% to 100%), respectively (p=0.05). This retrospective study suggests that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning might be a useful therapeutic option for some patients with ALL who are ineligible for standard myeloablative conditioning.

Childhood leukemia: electric and magnetic fields as possible risk factors.,Environmental health perspectives,Environ. Health Perspect.,2003-06-01,"Numerous epidemiologic studies have reported associations between measures of power-line electric or magnetic fields (EMFs) and childhood leukemia. The basis for such associations remains unexplained. In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents approximately three-quarters of all U.S. leukemia types. Some risk factors for childhood leukemia have been established, and others are suspected. Pathogenesis, as investigated in animal models, is consistent with the multistep model of acute leukemia development. Studies of carcinogenicity in animals, however, are overwhelmingly negative and do not support the hypothesis that EMF exposure is a significant risk factor for hematopoietic neoplasia. We may fail to observe effects from EMFs because, from a mechanistic perspective, the effects of EMFs on biology are very weak. Cells and organs function despite many sources of chemical ""noise"" (e.g., stochastic, temperature, concentration, mechanical, and electrical noise), which exceed the induced EMF ""signal"" by a large factor. However, the inability to detect EMF effects in bioassay systems may be caused by the choice made for ""EMF exposure."" ""Contact currents"" or ""contact voltages"" have been proposed as a novel exposure metric, because their magnitude is related to measured power-line magnetic fields.

Newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: update on prognostic factors and treatment.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2003-07-01,"The development of effective therapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is one of the great successes of clinical hematology andoncology. Fifty years ago, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was universally fatal, but current long-term event-free survival rates are nearly 80%. Despite this improved outcome, there are still many challenges facing investigators today. In some recent clinical trials, the outcome of ""high-risk"" patients has approached that of ""lower risk"" patients, suggesting that currently applied clinical factors, such as age and presenting leukocyte count, no longer identify the 20% of newly diagnosed patients who ultimately will relapse. Additionally, therapy remains nonspecific, toxic, and sometimes lethal. As more children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survive into adolescence and adulthood, there is a need to address the late sequelae of current therapy and to develop more leukemia-specific treatments. Promising avenues of research, which may identify biologically distinctive subsets of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and potential targets for novel therapies, include studies of minimal residual disease, lymphoblast genetics (including genetic profiling studies), and host-related pharmacogenomics.",Journal Article,6048.0,33.0,development effective therapy children acute lymphoblastic leukemia great successes clinical hematology andoncology years ago childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia universally fatal current long-term event-free survival rates nearly 80 Despite improved outcome challenges facing investigators today recent clinical trials outcome `` high-risk '' patients approached `` lower risk '' patients suggesting currently applied clinical factors age presenting leukocyte count longer identify 20 newly diagnosed patients ultimately relapse Additionally therapy remains nonspecific toxic lethal children acute lymphoblastic leukemia survive adolescence adulthood need address late sequelae current therapy develop leukemia-specific treatments Promising avenues research identify biologically distinctive subsets acute lymphoblastic leukemia potential targets novel therapies include studies minimal residual disease lymphoblast genetics including genetic profiling studies host-related pharmacogenomics,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 193, 1, 323, 36, 9, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 16, 104, 1, 3, 2797, 6697, 1, 38, 6216, 53575, 1461, 60, 5028, 864, 286, 1275, 10, 6813, 3034, 84, 291, 319, 337, 774, 115, 25, 151, 32, 1857, 493, 550, 26, 231, 228, 125, 32, 1234, 445, 1427, 7917, 2394, 5665, 4, 476, 435, 38, 143, 3, 228, 1, 64, 43, 522, 7, 71, 5738, 17, 1, 280, 43, 522, 7, 802, 17, 694, 1498, 38, 130, 225, 22, 89, 2, 1656, 3627, 1276, 77, 589, 255, 3, 179, 1, 732, 265, 7, 54, 2050, 303, 429, 1724, 36, 469, 5893, 1812, 2, 5164, 2266, 22, 80, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 4573, 237, 6964, 2, 6002, 125, 16, 8, 594, 6, 1539, 3, 807, 4156, 1, 291, 36, 2, 6, 690, 80, 2647, 112, 640, 721, 6612, 1, 389, 92, 68, 255, 2665, 5049, 1890, 1, 286, 1275, 2, 174, 637, 9, 229, 235, 643, 94, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 19414, 2894, 141, 336, 1080, 94, 2, 1204, 139, 7603]",1198.0,12799535,Newly diagnosed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia update prognostic factors treatment,87,0.09508196721311475
Antagonism by methotrexate on mercaptopurine disposition in lymphoblasts during up-front treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,Clin. Pharmacol. Ther.,2003-06-01,"Methotrexate is postulated to enhance mercaptopurine activation to thioguanine (INN, tioguanine) nucleotides, but the interaction has never been studied in vivo in cancer cells. We investigated the effect of methotrexate on mercaptopurine disposition in plasma and leukemic blasts during up-front treatment of 233 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Children were randomized to receive intravenous mercaptopurine (1 g/m(2) over a 6-hour period) or to receive methotrexate (low dose, 6 oral doses of 30 mg/m(2), or high dose, 1 g/m(2) intravenously), followed by intravenous mercaptopurine. All combinations have been previously used in frontline trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Compared with mercaptopurine alone, methotrexate resulted in higher plasma mercaptopurine concentrations (30.3 +/- 14.7 micromol/L versus 23.5 +/- 18.0 micromol/L, P <.001) but, conversely, a 13-fold lower thioguanine nucleotide concentration (0.57 +/- 0.66 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells versus 7.4 +/- 15.2 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells, P <.001) in bone marrow leukemic lymphoblasts. Methotrexate was also associated with higher plasma hypoxanthine concentrations compared with those of patients given mercaptopurine alone (8.7 +/- 13.5 micromol/L versus 3.8 +/- 2.5 micromol/L, P =.029). The percentage change in leukocyte counts measured over a 3-day period showed that mercaptopurine alone had little effect (mean decrease, 20% +/- 33%). In contrast, despite causing lower intracellular thiopurine active metabolite concentrations, methotrexate produced a greater decrease in leukocyte counts (mean, 53% +/- 35%) compared with those in patients receiving mercaptopurine alone (P <.0001). These pharmacologic findings in the target tissue are consistent with the recently demonstrated lack of clinical benefit of intravenous mercaptopurine in combination with methotrexate. We conclude that, in the setting of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, methotrexate antagonizes thiopurine metabolite disposition in leukemic blasts after intravenous mercaptopurine.",Clinical Trial,6078.0,13.0,Methotrexate postulated enhance mercaptopurine activation thioguanine INN tioguanine nucleotides interaction studied vivo investigated effect methotrexate mercaptopurine disposition plasma leukemic blasts up-front treatment 233 children newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia Children randomized receive intravenous mercaptopurine 1 g/m 2 6-hour period receive methotrexate low dose 6 oral doses 30 mg/m 2 high dose 1 g/m 2 intravenously followed intravenous mercaptopurine combinations previously frontline trials acute lymphoblastic leukemia Compared mercaptopurine methotrexate resulted higher plasma mercaptopurine concentrations 30.3 +/- 14.7 micromol/L versus 23.5 +/- 18.0 micromol/L P .001 conversely 13-fold lower thioguanine nucleotide concentration 0.57 +/- 0.66 pmol/5 x 10 6 versus 7.4 +/- 15.2 pmol/5 x 10 6 P .001 bone marrow leukemic lymphoblasts Methotrexate associated higher plasma hypoxanthine concentrations compared patients given mercaptopurine 8.7 +/- 13.5 micromol/L versus 3.8 +/- 2.5 micromol/L P =.029 percentage change leukocyte counts measured 3-day period showed mercaptopurine little effect mean decrease 20 +/- 33 contrast despite causing lower intracellular thiopurine active metabolite concentrations methotrexate produced greater decrease leukocyte counts mean 53 +/- 35 compared patients receiving mercaptopurine P .0001 pharmacologic findings target tissue consistent recently demonstrated lack clinical benefit intravenous mercaptopurine combination methotrexate conclude setting newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia methotrexate antagonizes thiopurine metabolite disposition leukemic blasts intravenous mercaptopurine,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2116, 16, 6507, 6, 1304, 9223, 363, 6, 17598, 37475, 53586, 11381, 84, 3, 915, 71, 1737, 85, 656, 4, 386, 4, 12, 37, 21, 565, 3, 254, 1, 2116, 23, 9223, 5814, 4, 554, 2, 2015, 2438, 190, 126, 3007, 24, 1, 7005, 541, 5, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 541, 11, 384, 6, 560, 1262, 9223, 14, 499, 188, 18, 252, 8, 49, 2583, 727, 15, 6, 560, 2116, 154, 61, 49, 518, 415, 1, 201, 81, 188, 18, 15, 64, 61, 14, 499, 188, 18, 1672, 370, 20, 1262, 9223, 62, 1247, 47, 85, 373, 95, 4, 3171, 143, 9, 286, 1275, 72, 5, 9223, 279, 2116, 627, 4, 142, 554, 9223, 1003, 201, 27, 213, 67, 6297, 805, 185, 382, 33, 203, 13, 6297, 805, 19, 144, 84, 3154, 8, 233, 1116, 280, 17598, 1579, 1227, 13, 696, 13, 700, 9835, 33, 1006, 79, 49, 37, 185, 67, 39, 167, 18, 9835, 33, 1006, 79, 49, 37, 19, 144, 4, 581, 2015, 10521, 2116, 10, 120, 41, 5, 142, 554, 26052, 1003, 72, 5, 135, 1, 7, 447, 9223, 279, 66, 67, 233, 33, 6297, 805, 185, 27, 66, 18, 33, 6297, 805, 19, 4770, 3, 1150, 707, 4, 3627, 1911, 644, 252, 8, 27, 218, 727, 224, 17, 9223, 279, 42, 1215, 254, 313, 775, 179, 466, 4, 748, 550, 3440, 280, 2087, 14062, 544, 3379, 1003, 2116, 1687, 8, 378, 775, 4, 3627, 1911, 313, 699, 465, 72, 5, 135, 4, 7, 357, 9223, 279, 19, 488, 46, 2788, 272, 4, 3, 283, 246, 32, 925, 5, 3, 761, 264, 926, 1, 38, 247, 1, 1262, 9223, 4, 150, 5, 2116, 21, 2060, 17, 4, 3, 546, 1, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 2116, 11574, 14062, 3379, 5814, 4, 2015, 2438, 50, 1262, 9223]",1974.0,12811360,Antagonism methotrexate mercaptopurine disposition lymphoblasts up-front treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Height and weight in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia: relationship to CNS treatment.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-08-01,"We evaluated the long-term effects of treatment on height and weight in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with one of the following three different CNS therapies: intrathecal therapy alone, intrathecal therapy with conventional cranial radiation, or intrathecal therapy with twice-daily radiation. Between 1987 and 1995, 618 children treated on two consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocols for ALL were measured for height and weight at diagnosis, and approximately every 6 months thereafter. Patient height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were converted to z scores for age and sex using the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for the United States. Children younger than 13 years at diagnosis had a statistically significant decrease in their height z scores and an increase in their BMI z scores, regardless of whether they had received cranial radiation. Young age at diagnosis and increased chemotherapy intensity were major risk factors. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in long-term height between children who received radiation and those who did not. Final height is compromised in survivors of ALL.

"Homocysteine, pharmacogenetics, and neurotoxicity in children with leukemia.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-08-01,"Despite its clinical success, methotrexate (MTX) therapy is associated with toxicities such as seizures, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. It has been suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia is caused by MTX and is responsible for its neurotoxic effects. The purposes of this study were to explore whether hyperhomocysteinemia was related to MTX administration and toxicity and whether homocysteine or MTX toxicity differed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or reduced folate carrier (RFC) genetic polymorphisms. We studied 53 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were consecutively treated on a single clinical protocol that included two courses of high-dose MTX (high-dose methotrexate [HDMTX]; 2.5 or 5.0 g/m2 per day) as consolidation therapy. The study participants' median plasma homocysteine concentrations at 23 and 44 hours after HDMTX (9.00 micromol/L and 10.12 micromol/L, respectively) were greater than the concentrations immediately before HDMTX (5.77 micromol/L, P <.0001 for both comparisons). Seven days after HDMTX treatment, their plasma concentration returned to baseline. Nine patients experienced seizures, and five patients experienced thrombosis during the first 15 months of therapy, with a tendency for there to be higher plasma homocysteine in patients with seizures across all time points (P =.063) but not in patients with thrombosis (P =.59). We observed no significant differences in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine levels or in toxicity based on the MTHFR 677C/T or RFC 80G/A genotypes. We conclude that homocysteine was transiently elevated after HDMTX and may be related to seizure risk in children with leukemia.",Journal Article,6017.0,168.0,Despite clinical success methotrexate MTX therapy associated toxicities seizures pathogenesis remains unclear suggested hyperhomocysteinemia caused MTX responsible neurotoxic effects purposes explore hyperhomocysteinemia related MTX administration toxicity homocysteine MTX toxicity differed methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR reduced folate carrier RFC genetic polymorphisms studied 53 children newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia consecutively treated single clinical protocol included courses high-dose MTX high-dose methotrexate HDMTX 2.5 5.0 g/m2 day consolidation therapy participants median plasma homocysteine concentrations 23 44 hours HDMTX 9.00 micromol/L 10.12 micromol/L respectively greater concentrations immediately HDMTX 5.77 micromol/L P .0001 comparisons Seven days HDMTX treatment plasma concentration returned baseline patients experienced seizures patients experienced thrombosis 15 months therapy tendency higher plasma homocysteine patients seizures time points P =.063 patients thrombosis P =.59 observed significant differences plasma cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine levels toxicity based MTHFR 677C/T RFC 80G/A genotypes conclude homocysteine transiently elevated HDMTX related seizure risk children leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 211, 38, 1825, 2116, 3453, 36, 16, 41, 5, 385, 225, 22, 4448, 3, 1384, 1, 92, 469, 1200, 192, 71, 85, 1148, 17, 43338, 16, 1546, 20, 3453, 2, 16, 2327, 9, 211, 11148, 176, 3, 4624, 1, 26, 45, 11, 6, 1645, 317, 43338, 10, 139, 6, 3453, 634, 2, 155, 2, 317, 12798, 15, 3453, 155, 2512, 20, 15586, 4027, 8342, 15, 405, 3100, 4715, 9270, 336, 1203, 21, 656, 699, 541, 5, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 54, 11, 7380, 73, 23, 8, 226, 38, 1182, 17, 159, 100, 1993, 1, 64, 61, 3453, 64, 61, 2116, 10061, 18, 33, 15, 33, 13, 499, 821, 379, 218, 22, 2173, 36, 3, 45, 776, 52, 554, 12798, 1003, 28, 382, 2, 584, 1459, 50, 10061, 83, 2038, 6297, 805, 2, 79, 133, 6297, 805, 106, 11, 378, 76, 3, 1003, 3467, 348, 10061, 33, 849, 6297, 805, 19, 488, 9, 110, 2213, 648, 162, 50, 10061, 24, 136, 554, 1227, 5157, 6, 330, 762, 7, 592, 4448, 2, 365, 7, 592, 2839, 190, 3, 157, 167, 53, 1, 36, 5, 8, 7135, 9, 125, 6, 40, 142, 554, 12798, 4, 7, 5, 4448, 716, 62, 98, 862, 19, 10592, 84, 44, 4, 7, 5, 2839, 19, 728, 21, 164, 77, 93, 362, 4, 554, 15, 5156, 2357, 12798, 148, 15, 4, 155, 90, 23, 3, 8342, 26205, 102, 15, 9270, 53691, 8, 2071, 21, 2060, 17, 12798, 10, 9235, 804, 50, 10061, 2, 68, 40, 139, 6, 5866, 43, 4, 541, 5]",1647.0,12915598,Homocysteine pharmacogenetics neurotoxicity children leukemia,35,0.03825136612021858
Extended follow-up of long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003-08-01,"Children who survive acute lymphoblastic leukemia are at risk for leukemia-related or treatment-related complications, which can adversely affect survival and socioeconomic status. We determined the long-term survival and the rates of health insurance coverage, marriage, and employment among patients who had attained at least 10 years of event-free survival. A total of 856 eligible patients were treated between 1962 and 1992 in 13 consecutive clinical trials. Survival rates, the cumulative risk of a second neoplasm, and selected indicators of socioeconomic status were analyzed for the entire group and for patients who did or did not receive cranial or craniospinal radiation therapy during initial treatment. Fifty-six patients had major adverse events, including 8 deaths during remission, 4 relapses, and 44 second neoplasms (41 of them radiation-related); most of the second neoplasms were benign or of a low grade of malignant potential. The risk of a second neoplasm was significantly higher in the 597 patients who received radiation therapy (irradiated group) than in the 259 patients who did not receive radiation therapy (nonirradiated group) (P=0.04; estimated cumulative risk [+/-SE] at 20 years, 20.9+/-3.9 percent vs. 0.95+/-0.9 percent). The death rate for the irradiated group slightly exceeded the expected rate in the general U.S. population (standardized mortality ratio, 1.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.12 to 3.00), whereas that for the nonirradiated group did not differ from the population norm (standardized mortality ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 5.00). The rates of health insurance coverage, marriage, and employment in the nonirradiated group were similar to the age- and sex-adjusted national averages. Despite having health insurance rates similar to those in the general population, men and women in the irradiated group had higher-than-average unemployment rates (15.1 percent vs. 5.4 percent and 35.4 percent vs. 5.2 percent, respectively), and women in the irradiated group were less likely to be married (35.2 percent vs. 48.8 percent). Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who did not receive radiation therapy and who have attained 10 or more years of event-free survival can expect a normal long-term survival.

In this case-control study, associations were explored between specific medications as recorded in the medical records of 243 mothers of infants who were diagnosed with leukemia at < 18 months of age and 393 mothers ol infants without leukemia identified through random digit dialing. Cases included 157 acute lymphoblastic (ALL), 77 acute myeloid (AML), and nine other leukemias. A total of 27 different drugs that were prescribed for at least six women were analyzed. Overall, non-statistically significant negative associations (Odds ratios, OR < 0.5) were observed with amoxicillin, nystatin, clomiphene, levothyroxine, cefaclor, and trimethobenzamide HCL. When cases were restricted to either myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia, cotrimoxazole was prescribed for five ALL case mothers and no matched controls; no association with cotrimoxazole was observed with AML. Given the number of comparisons, chance cannot be ruled out for any of the associations found here. However, a strength of this study is the lack of recall bias.

Sequence analysis of clonal immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis and at relapse: implications for pathogenesis and for the clinical utility of PCR-based methods of minimal residual disease detection.,Blood,Blood,2003-08-28,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements provide clonal markers useful for diagnosis and measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed the sequences of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements obtained at presentation and relapse in 41 children with ALL to study clonal stability, which has important implications for monitoring MRD, during the course of the disease. In 42%, all original Ig and/or TCR sequences were conserved. In 24%, one original sequence was preserved but the other lost, and in 14% the original sequences were conserved with new sequences identified at relapse. In 20% only new sequences were found at relapse. Using primers designed from the novel relapse sequences, the relapse clone could be identified as subdominant clones in the diagnostic sample in 8 of 14 patients. Alteration of these clonal gene rearrangements is a common feature in childhood ALL.

Effects of prednisone and genetic polymorphisms on etoposide disposition in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-09-11,"Etoposide is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and UGT1A1. Glucocorticoids modulate CYP3A and P-glycoprotein in preclinical models, but their effect on clinical etoposide disposition is unknown. We studied the pharmacokinetics of etoposide and its catechol metabolite in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, along with polymorphisms in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, MDR1, GSTP1, UGT1A1, and VDR. Plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed at day 29, after 1 month of prednisone (n = 102), and at week 54, without prednisone (n = 44). On day 29, etoposide clearance was higher (47.4 versus 29.2 mL/min/m2, P <.0001) than at week 54. The day 29 etoposide or catechol area under the curve (AUC) was correlated with neutropenia (P =.027 and P =.0008, respectively). The relationship between genotype and etoposide disposition differed by race and by prednisone use. The MDR1 exon 26 CC genotype predicted higher day 29 etoposide clearance (P =.002) for all patients, and the CYP3A5 AA and GSTP1 AA genotypes predicted lower clearance in blacks (P =.02 and.03, respectively).

The biology and therapy of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-10-01,"Much progress has been made in understanding the biology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This has translated into the recognition of several subgroups of ALL and the institution of risk-adapted therapies. New therapies are emerging based on the definition of specific cytogenetic-molecular abnormalities. A review from the English literature, including original articles and related reviews from Medline (Pubmed) and abstracts based on publication of meeting material, was performed. Changes in the pathologic classification of ALL have led to therapeutic consequences. Adaptation of successful treatment strategies in children with ALL has resulted in similar complete response rates in adults. Prognosis has especially improved in mature-B-cell and T-lineage ALL. The role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL was evaluated in the current study. However, regardless of the ALL subgroup, long-term survival of adults is still inferior to that in children. Intense clinical and laboratory research is attempting to close the gap in outcome between children and adults with ALL. Investigations are focusing on 1) refinement of the basic treatment stratagem of induction, consolidation, and maintenance; 2) expansion of risk-based, subgroup-oriented therapies; 3) assessment of minimal residual disease, its impact on disease recurrence, and its practical implications in clinical practice; 4) salvage strategies; 5) the role of stem cell transplantation in ALL; and 6) the development of new drugs based on a better understanding of disease biology.",Journal Article,5956.0,115.0,progress understanding acute lymphoblastic leukemia translated recognition subgroups institution risk-adapted therapies New therapies emerging based definition specific cytogenetic-molecular abnormalities review English literature including original articles related reviews Medline Pubmed abstracts based publication meeting material performed Changes pathologic classification led therapeutic consequences Adaptation successful treatment strategies children resulted similar complete response rates adults Prognosis especially improved mature-B-cell T-lineage role tyrosine kinase inhibitors Philadelphia chromosome-positive evaluated current regardless subgroup long-term survival adults inferior children Intense clinical laboratory research attempting close gap outcome children adults Investigations focusing 1 refinement basic treatment stratagem induction consolidation maintenance 2 expansion risk-based subgroup-oriented therapies 3 assessment minimal residual disease impact disease recurrence practical implications clinical practice 4 salvage strategies 5 role stem transplantation 6 development new drugs based better understanding disease,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1802, 1466, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 612, 3, 891, 1, 286, 1275, 62, 26, 71, 5136, 237, 3, 2335, 1, 392, 1453, 1, 62, 2, 3, 731, 1, 43, 3716, 235, 217, 235, 32, 1478, 90, 23, 3, 2470, 1, 112, 1266, 219, 1171, 8, 206, 29, 3, 4201, 789, 141, 2279, 2384, 2, 139, 2004, 29, 3388, 3161, 2, 5159, 90, 23, 4397, 1, 2238, 3692, 10, 173, 400, 4, 3, 510, 947, 1, 62, 47, 836, 6, 189, 3255, 7275, 1, 1401, 24, 422, 4, 541, 5, 62, 71, 627, 4, 288, 236, 51, 151, 4, 857, 356, 71, 1093, 231, 4, 2908, 132, 31, 2, 102, 2542, 62, 3, 200, 1, 564, 216, 222, 4, 3006, 1170, 109, 62, 10, 194, 4, 3, 291, 45, 137, 1583, 1, 3, 62, 1363, 319, 337, 25, 1, 857, 16, 1234, 1663, 6, 17, 4, 541, 3933, 38, 2, 1624, 389, 16, 9632, 6, 2336, 3, 5285, 4, 228, 59, 541, 2, 857, 5, 62, 2492, 32, 3312, 23, 14, 7266, 1, 3, 2795, 24, 53763, 1, 504, 2173, 2, 1146, 18, 1422, 1, 43, 90, 1363, 8095, 235, 27, 455, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 211, 345, 23, 34, 146, 2, 211, 3320, 1268, 4, 38, 758, 39, 992, 422, 33, 3, 200, 1, 452, 31, 497, 4, 62, 2, 49, 3, 193, 1, 217, 600, 90, 23, 8, 380, 612, 1, 34, 891]",1544.0,14508819,therapy adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia,427,0.4666666666666667

Historically, T-ALL patients have had a worse prognosis than other ALL patients. We reviewed the outcomes of 125 patients with T-ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium trials between 1981 and 1995. Therapy included four- or five-agent remission induction; consolidation therapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, corticosteroid, mercaptopurine, and weekly high-dose asparaginase; and cranial radiation. T-ALL patients were treated the same as high-risk B-progenitor ALL patients. Fifteen patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma were also treated with the same high-risk regimen between 1981 and 2000. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate for T-ALL patients was 75% +/- 4%. Fourteen of 15 patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma were long-term survivors. There was no significant difference in EFS comparing patients with T-ALL and B-progenitor ALL (P =.56), although T-ALL patients had significantly higher rates of induction failure (P <.0001), and central nervous system (CNS) relapse (P =.02). The median time to relapse in T-ALL patients was 1.2 years versus 2.5 years in B-progenitor ALL patients (P =.001). There were no pretreatment characteristics associated with worse prognosis in patients with T-ALL. T-ALL patients fared as well as B-progenitor patients on DFCI ALL Consortium protocols.

Results of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in black and white children.,JAMA,JAMA,2003-10-01,"Treatment results for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) clearly have improved over the past decade, but black children have not fared as well as white children in large national trials. To compare the clinical outcomes of therapy for black and white children with ALL treated at a single institution. A retrospective analysis of 412 children and adolescents (68 black, 338 white, and 6 other race) with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated consecutively at a pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tenn. Patients were enrolled from December 1991 to July 1998 in successive Total Therapy studies regardless of race, ethnicity, or ability to pay and received risk-directed therapy according to stringent criteria. All patients received the same intensive, remission-induction therapy followed by 120 weeks of risk-assigned postremission therapy that included reinduction treatment, pulses of high-dose methotrexate, and early intensification of intrathecal chemotherapy. Event-free and overall survival rates for black and white children were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier and compared with the Mantel-Haenszel test and by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusting for known prognostic factors. The 68 black children were significantly more likely than the 338 white children to have higher-risk prognostic features, including an initial leukocyte count greater than 100 x 10(3)/ microL, a T-cell immunophenotype, and the t(1;19) chromosomal translocation with E2A-PBX1 fusion, and were less likely to have hyperdiploid blast cells, a favorable prognostic factor in childhood ALL. However, the clinical outcomes for these 2 cohorts were not significantly different: 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 80.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.3%-91.1%) and 86.2% (95% CI, 77.2%-95.2%) for black children vs 79.4% (95% CI, 74.7%-84.1%) and 85.0% (95% CI, 80.9%-89.1%) for white children.

Thyroid carcinoma presenting in childhood or after treatment of childhood malignancies: An institutional experience and review of the literature.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2003-11-01,"Thyroid carcinomas can occur as a primary malignancy (PTM) or secondary after another malignancy (STM). Information about the presentations and outcomes of patients with STM are limited. The authors sought to compare the clinical characteristics, course, and outcomes of patients with primary or secondary thyroid malignancies. The authors reviewed the medical records of 8 children with PTM and 17 children with STM referred to St Jude Children's Research Hospital between February 1962 and February 2002 for evaluation and treatment of malignant thyroid carcinoma. The 8 children who had primary thyroid carcinoma had it diagnosed at a median age of 12.5 years (range, 7.3 to 16.3 years). Seven patients had papillary carcinoma, and 1 patient had follicular carcinoma. Three of the 8 (37.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes; 2 patients (25.0%) had lung metastases. Six patients required radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after surgical resection. All 8 patients remain alive a median of 22.6 years after diagnosis (range, 0.7 to 30.5 years); 1 continues to receive radioactive iodine (I 131) ablation for persistent disease. Seventeen patients had thyroid carcinoma as a second malignant neoplasm after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), Hodgkin's disease (n = 5), central nervous system tumor (n = 2), Wilms' tumor (n = 1), retinoblastoma (n = 1), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), or neuroblastoma (n = 1). Patients with secondary thyroid carcinoma presented at a median age of 21.5 years (range, 15.3 to 42.6 years), a median of 16.2 years (range, 0.9 to 29.2 years) after diagnosis of the primary cancer. Twelve of the 17 patients (70.6%) had received radiation to the thyroid gland during therapy for the primary cancer. Four patients (23.5%) had metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes. Six patients (35.3%) required I(131) ablation for residual or metastatic disease after thyroidectomy. At the time of this report, all 17 patients are alive and in continue to be free of disease. Pediatric thyroid carcinoma is uncommon and responds well to current therapy. Given the limited period of follow-up of our cohort of secondary malignant thyroid tumors that arise after childhood cancer, these lesions appear to have similar presentations and outcomes when compared with primary carcinomas and can therefore be managed in the same manner.",Journal Article,5925.0,60.0,Thyroid carcinomas occur primary malignancy PTM secondary malignancy STM Information presentations outcomes patients STM limited authors sought compare clinical characteristics course outcomes patients primary secondary thyroid malignancies authors reviewed medical records 8 children PTM 17 children STM referred St Jude Children 's Research Hospital February 1962 February 2002 evaluation treatment malignant thyroid carcinoma 8 children primary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed median age 12.5 years range 7.3 16.3 years Seven patients papillary carcinoma 1 patient follicular carcinoma 8 37.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes 2 patients 25.0 lung metastases patients required radioactive iodine 131 ablation residual metastatic disease surgical resection 8 patients remain alive median 22.6 years diagnosis range 0.7 30.5 years 1 continues receive radioactive iodine 131 ablation persistent disease Seventeen patients thyroid carcinoma second malignant neoplasm treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia n 6 Hodgkin 's disease n 5 central nervous n 2 Wilms n 1 retinoblastoma n 1 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma n 1 neuroblastoma n 1 Patients secondary thyroid carcinoma presented median age 21.5 years range 15.3 42.6 years median 16.2 years range 0.9 29.2 years diagnosis primary 17 patients 70.6 received radiation thyroid gland therapy primary patients 23.5 metastatic disease involving regional lymph nodes patients 35.3 required 131 ablation residual metastatic disease thyroidectomy time report 17 patients alive continue free disease Pediatric thyroid carcinoma uncommon responds current therapy Given limited period follow-up cohort secondary malignant thyroid arise childhood lesions appear similar presentations outcomes compared primary carcinomas managed manner,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[826, 122, 1271, 22, 8, 86, 710, 23207, 15, 568, 50, 1809, 710, 20338, 487, 545, 3, 4261, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 20338, 32, 383, 3, 738, 990, 6, 932, 3, 38, 374, 906, 2, 123, 1, 7, 5, 86, 15, 568, 441, 3, 738, 446, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 66, 541, 5, 23207, 2, 269, 541, 5, 20338, 1995, 6, 3062, 4841, 541, 292, 389, 702, 59, 3010, 14754, 2, 3010, 1544, 9, 451, 2, 24, 1, 393, 134, 3, 66, 541, 54, 42, 86, 134, 42, 192, 265, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 133, 33, 60, 184, 67, 27, 6, 245, 27, 60, 648, 7, 42, 1796, 134, 2, 14, 69, 42, 1974, 134, 169, 1, 3, 66, 567, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 18, 7, 243, 13, 42, 196, 437, 7, 616, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 221, 170, 62, 66, 7, 918, 1701, 8, 52, 1, 350, 49, 60, 50, 147, 184, 13, 67, 6, 201, 33, 60, 14, 2274, 6, 560, 4741, 4287, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 1882, 34, 3591, 7, 42, 134, 22, 8, 419, 393, 2131, 50, 24, 9, 286, 1275, 78, 49, 292, 34, 78, 33, 854, 1880, 398, 30, 78, 18, 30, 78, 14, 78, 14, 292, 78, 14, 15, 78, 14, 7, 5, 568, 134, 917, 28, 8, 52, 89, 1, 239, 33, 60, 184, 167, 27, 6, 595, 49, 60, 8, 52, 1, 245, 18, 60, 184, 13, 83, 6, 462, 18, 60, 50, 147, 1, 3, 86, 12, 2544, 1, 3, 269, 7, 431, 49, 42, 103, 121, 6, 3, 2326, 190, 36, 9, 3, 86, 12, 294, 7, 382, 33, 42, 113, 34, 1267, 951, 263, 502, 437, 7, 465, 27, 616, 70, 2229, 1650, 9, 753, 15, 113, 34, 50, 5949, 28, 3, 98, 1, 26, 414, 62, 269, 7, 32, 1701, 2, 4, 1906, 6, 40, 115, 1, 34, 815, 134, 16, 2052, 2, 7920, 149, 6, 291, 36, 447, 3, 383, 727, 1, 166, 126, 1, 114, 180, 1, 568, 393, 57, 17, 3043, 50, 864, 12, 46, 406, 1322, 6, 47, 288, 4261, 2, 123, 198, 72, 5, 86, 826, 2, 122, 673, 40, 2231, 4, 3, 827, 1708]",2184.0,14614703,Thyroid carcinoma presenting childhood treatment childhood malignancies institutional experience review literature,1,0.001092896174863388
IL-7-dependent human leukemia T-cell line as a valuable tool for drug discovery in T-ALL.,Blood,Blood,2003-11-13,"The specific targeting of critical signaling molecules may provide efficient therapies for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, target identification and drug development are limited by insufficient numbers of primary T-ALL cells and by their high rate of spontaneous apoptosis. We established a human interleukin-7 (IL-7)-dependent T-ALL cell line, TAIL7, that maintains several biologic and signaling properties of its parental leukemia cells. TAIL7 cells are pre-T-ALL cells that proliferate in response to IL-7 and IL-4. IL-7 stimulation of TAIL7 cells prevents spontaneous in vitro apoptosis and induces cell activation and cell cycle progression. The signaling events triggered by IL-7 include down-regulation of p27(kip1) and hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Stimulation of TAIL7 cells by IL-7 leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), Akt/PKB (protein kinase B), and extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2). Importantly, specific blockade of JAK3 by its inhibitor WHI-P131 abrogates the IL-7-mediated proliferation and survival of TAIL7 cells, suggesting that activation of JAK3 is critical for IL-7 responsiveness by these cells. Because TAIL7 cells seem to be a biologic surrogate for primary leukemia T cells, this cell line constitutes a valuable tool for the study of the signaling pathways implicated in T-ALL. Exploitation of this cell line should allow the identification of molecular targets and promote the rational design and validation of antileukemia signaling inhibitors.",Journal Article,5913.0,40.0,specific targeting critical signaling molecules provide efficient therapies T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL target identification drug development limited insufficient numbers primary T-ALL high rate spontaneous apoptosis established human interleukin-7 IL-7 -dependent T-ALL line TAIL7 maintains biologic signaling properties parental leukemia TAIL7 pre-T-ALL proliferate response IL-7 IL-4 IL-7 stimulation TAIL7 prevents spontaneous vitro apoptosis induces activation cycle progression signaling events triggered IL-7 include down-regulation p27 kip1 hyperphosphorylation retinoblastoma Rb Stimulation TAIL7 IL-7 leads phosphorylation Janus kinase 3 JAK3 signal transducer activator transcription 5 STAT5 Akt/PKB kinase B extracellular-regulated kinase 1 2 Erk1/2 Importantly specific blockade JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 abrogates IL-7-mediated proliferation survival TAIL7 suggesting activation JAK3 critical IL-7 responsiveness TAIL7 biologic surrogate primary leukemia line constitutes valuable tool signaling pathways implicated T-ALL Exploitation line allow identification molecular targets promote rational design validation antileukemia signaling inhibitors,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 112, 529, 1, 740, 314, 1598, 68, 377, 2547, 235, 9, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 137, 283, 911, 2, 234, 193, 32, 383, 20, 3027, 1870, 1, 86, 102, 62, 37, 2, 20, 136, 64, 116, 1, 3280, 351, 21, 635, 8, 171, 1603, 67, 501, 67, 470, 102, 62, 31, 328, 28147, 17, 8107, 392, 1283, 2, 314, 1571, 1, 211, 3418, 37, 28147, 37, 32, 671, 102, 62, 37, 17, 9554, 4, 51, 6, 501, 67, 2, 501, 39, 501, 67, 2503, 1, 28147, 37, 5217, 3280, 4, 439, 351, 2, 1516, 31, 363, 2, 31, 417, 91, 3, 314, 281, 4173, 20, 501, 67, 643, 1328, 863, 1, 2804, 5584, 2, 23280, 1, 178, 2955, 2503, 1, 28147, 37, 20, 501, 67, 1940, 6, 982, 1, 6191, 216, 27, 18927, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 33, 5517, 649, 10662, 178, 216, 132, 2, 1976, 1065, 216, 14, 2, 18, 3533, 18, 1859, 112, 1189, 1, 18927, 20, 211, 230, 10465, 53858, 8044, 3, 501, 67, 517, 457, 2, 25, 1, 28147, 37, 802, 17, 363, 1, 18927, 16, 740, 9, 501, 67, 3642, 20, 46, 37, 408, 28147, 37, 3233, 6, 40, 8, 1283, 2592, 9, 86, 102, 37, 26, 31, 328, 6788, 8, 2926, 1515, 9, 3, 45, 1, 3, 314, 460, 1771, 4, 102, 62, 11588, 1, 26, 31, 328, 257, 1700, 3, 911, 1, 219, 637, 2, 1617, 3, 2696, 771, 2, 929, 1, 9169, 314, 222]",1532.0,14615384,IL-7-dependent human leukemia T-cell line valuable tool drug discovery T-ALL,0,0.0
Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2003-01-01,"The outcome for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved dramatically with current therapy resulting in an event free survival exceeding 75% for most patients. However significant challenges remain including developing better methods to predict which patients can be cured with less toxic treatment and which ones will benefit from augmented therapy. In addition, 25% of patients fail therapy and novel treatments that are focused on undermining specifically the leukemic process are needed urgently. In Section I, Dr. Carroll reviews current approaches to risk classification and proposes a system that incorporates well-established clinical parameters, genetic lesions of the blast as well as early response parameters. He then provides an overview of emerging technologies in genomics and proteomics and how they might lead to more rational, biologically based classification systems. In Section II, Drs. Mary Relling and Stella Davies describe emerging findings that relate to host features that influence outcome, the role of inherited germline variation. They highlight technical breakthroughs in assessing germline differences among patients. Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing genes have been shown to influence toxicity and the best example is the gene thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) a key enzyme in the metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine. Polymorphisms are associated with decreased activity that is also associated with increased toxicity. The role of polymorphisms in other genes whose products play an important role in drug metabolism as well as cytokine genes are discussed. In Sections III and IV, Drs. James Downing and Cheryl Willman review their findings using gene expression profiling to classify ALL. Both authors outline challenges in applying this methodology to analysis of clinical samples. Dr. Willman describes her laboratory's examination of infant leukemia and precursor B-ALL where unsupervised approaches have led to the identification of inherent biologic groups not predicted by conventional morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic variables. Dr. Downing describes his results from a pediatric ALL expression database using over 327 diagnostic samples, with 80% of the dataset consisting of samples from patients treated on a single institutional protocol. Seven distinct leukemia subtypes were identified representing known leukemia subtypes including: BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, rearrangements in the MLL gene, hyperdiploid karyotype (i.e., > 50 chromosomes), and T-ALL as well as a new leukemia subtype. A subset of genes have been identified whose expression appears to be predictive of outcome but independent verification is needed before this type of analysis can be integrated into treatment assignment. Chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells by activating apoptosis, or programmed cell death. In Section V, Dr. John Reed describes major apoptotic pathways and the specific role of key proteins in this response. The expression level of some of these proteins, such as BCL2, BAX, and caspase 3, has been shown to be predictive of ultimate outcome in hematopoietic tumors. New therapeutic approaches that modulate the apoptotic pathway are now available and Dr. Reed highlights those that may be applicable to the treatment of childhood ALL.",Journal

Impact of CNS treatment on mood in adult survivors of childhood leukemia: a report from the Children's Cancer Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-12-01,"This study assessed the relationship between CNS treatment and psychologic mood using the Profile of Moods State (POMS), a standardized measure of affect, among a large sample of young adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; N = 555). Survivors of childhood ALL (ages 18 to 33 years at study entry) participated in a structured telephone interview eliciting demographic, health, and behavioral data and the POMS. Treatment data included total dose of CNS irradiation (CRT) and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) obtained from medical records. Mood disturbance was reported by 24% of survivors. High-dose CRT and MTX predicted disturbance rates modestly and primarily in combination with education variables. Interactions between educational achievement, a history of attendance in special education classes, and sex were better predictors than treatment type or dose. Nonwhite males, those younger than 12.5 years of age at diagnosis, and those with negative perceptions of current health and cancer's impact on employment were also at greater risk for mood disturbance (P <.01 to.001). Although most survivors are doing well psychologically, a subset of long-term survivors show potentially serious mood disturbance. Mood disturbance seems to be a function of interactions between preexisting individual difference variables (eg, sex, race/ethnicity), treatment factors, and posttreatment educational experiences. Prevention strategies aimed at childhood cancer survivors at greatest risk for mood disturbance may be improved by focus on posttreatment psychosocial and educational supports.",Comparative Study,5895.0,50.0,assessed relationship CNS treatment psychologic mood Profile Moods State POMS standardized measure affect large young adult survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia N 555 Survivors childhood ages 18 33 years entry participated structured telephone interview eliciting demographic health behavioral POMS Treatment included total dose CNS irradiation CRT intrathecal methotrexate MTX obtained medical records Mood disturbance reported 24 survivors High-dose CRT MTX predicted disturbance rates modestly primarily combination education variables Interactions educational achievement history attendance special education classes sex better predictors treatment type dose Nonwhite males younger 12.5 years age diagnosis negative perceptions current health 's impact employment greater risk mood disturbance P .01 to.001 survivors psychologically subset long-term survivors potentially mood disturbance Mood disturbance function interactions preexisting individual difference variables sex race/ethnicity treatment factors posttreatment educational experiences Prevention strategies aimed childhood survivors greatest risk mood disturbance improved focus posttreatment psychosocial educational supports,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 275, 3, 858, 59, 1025, 24, 2, 14388, 5234, 75, 3, 800, 1, 43450, 1309, 18320, 8, 1670, 1463, 1, 1158, 107, 8, 375, 1000, 1, 1169, 780, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 78, 10823, 332, 1, 864, 62, 2165, 203, 6, 466, 60, 28, 45, 3001, 3025, 4, 8, 5198, 4258, 4313, 10299, 1540, 341, 2, 4166, 74, 2, 3, 18320, 24, 74, 159, 181, 61, 1, 1025, 1104, 1089, 2, 5126, 2116, 3453, 683, 29, 484, 1064, 5234, 6663, 10, 210, 20, 259, 1, 332, 64, 61, 1089, 2, 3453, 783, 6663, 151, 5588, 2, 1561, 4, 150, 5, 1848, 682, 1286, 59, 3624, 5088, 8, 532, 1, 12349, 4, 3714, 1848, 3211, 2, 1035, 11, 380, 674, 76, 24, 267, 15, 61, 8335, 2296, 135, 773, 76, 133, 33, 60, 1, 89, 28, 147, 2, 135, 5, 199, 3746, 1, 291, 341, 2, 12, 292, 345, 23, 5141, 11, 120, 28, 378, 43, 9, 5234, 6663, 19, 355, 6, 144, 242, 96, 332, 32, 9647, 149, 24588, 8, 697, 1, 319, 337, 332, 514, 751, 1762, 5234, 6663, 5234, 6663, 2744, 6, 40, 8, 343, 1, 1286, 59, 5004, 797, 523, 682, 2887, 1035, 1047, 2091, 24, 130, 2, 3149, 3624, 4031, 1070, 422, 1295, 28, 864, 12, 332, 28, 2199, 43, 9, 5234, 6663, 68, 40, 231, 20, 1222, 23, 3149, 2322, 2, 3624, 2304]",1561.0,14645430,Impact CNS treatment mood adult survivors childhood leukemia report Children 's Group,2,0.002185792349726776
Reassessment of the prognostic significance of hypodiploidy in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2003-12-01,"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the cytogenetic features of the hypodiploid leukemic cells of pediatric patients with this rare subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, the authors determined whether subdivision of the hypodiploid category served a prognostic purpose for these patients. The authors evaluated the cytogenetic records of 979 patients with ALL admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) between 1984 and 1999. Of 67 patients (6.8%) whose leukemic cells contained a modal number (MN) of chromosomes less than or equal to 45 (i.e., hypodiploid leukemic cells), 57 had an MN of 45 and 10 had an MN of less than 45. In 19 patients, cells with an MN of 45 had a whole chromosome missing (42%), which was a sex chromosome in 12 patients (63%). Leukemic cells with an MN of 45 contained dicentric chromosomes (n = 33) formed from chromosome 9p (55%), 12p (18%), or both (21%). The ETV6-CBFA2 fusion was present in 39% of 28 evaluable B-lineage cases with an MN of 45. The event-free survival rate (EFS) for patients with hypodiploid leukemic cells of MN less than 45 (5-year EFS = 20.0% +/- 10.3%) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that for patients with leukemic cells of MN greater than or equal to 45 (5-year EFS = 74.9% +/- 1.6%).

FLT3 mutations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-12-11,"Activating mutations of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase are common in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) but are rare in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have recently shown that FLT3 is highly expressed and often mutated in ALLs with rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome 11q23. Because hyperdiploid ALL samples also show high-level expression of FLT3, we searched for the presence of FLT3 mutations in leukemic blasts from 71 patients with ALL.

Association of biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations with spontaneous chromosomal instability and solid tumors of childhood.,Blood,Blood,2003-12-11,"The clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings of 2 Fanconi anemia (FA) subtype D1 kindreds, initially identified through a young child with a solid tumor (medullobastoma, Wilms tumor), are described. Each kindred subsequently had a second affected child; one developed Wilms tumor followed by a medulloblastoma, and the other developed T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytogenetic studies revealed an unusually high spontaneous chromosome aberration rate, contrasting with other FA subtypes. Molecular analysis revealed biallelic BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations. The patients did not exhibit bone marrow failure. Our studies suggest that the D1 subtype represents a severe end of the cytogenetic spectrum within FA, consistent with a critical downstream role of BRCA2 in the FA pathway. Furthermore, this FA subgroup may be preferentially associated with an increased predisposition to solid tumors in early childhood.

Reduced folate carrier mutations are not the mechanism underlying methotrexate resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"Although the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured with combination chemotherapy containing methotrexate (MTX), drug resistance contributes to treatment failure for a substantial fraction of patients. The primary transporter for folates and MTX is the reduced folate carrier (RFC). Impaired drug transport is a documented mechanism of MTX resistance in patients with ALL; however, to the authors' knowledge it is not known whether inactivating RFC mutations are a contributing factor. The authors devised a genomic polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism assay followed by sequencing and screened the entire RFC coding region for sequence alterations in DNA from 246 leukemia specimens from patients with diverse ethnic variation, 24 at the time of recurrence and the rest at the time of diagnosis. This cohort was comprised of 203 B-precursor ALL specimens (82.5%), 32 T-lineage ALL specimens (13%), and 11 acute myeloblastic leukemia specimens (4.5%). Of 246 DNA samples, only 3 diagnosis B-precursor ALL specimens (1.2%) were found to harbor alterations in the RFC gene, including heterozygous single nucleotide changes resulting in D56H and D522N substitutions in the first extracellular loop and the C-terminus of this transporter, respectively. The third sample had a sequence alteration in exon 3 that could not be identified because of the lack of availability of DNA. Whereas inactivating RFC mutations are a frequent mechanism of MTX resistance in human leukemia cell lines and in patients with osteosarcoma, they are not common and do not appear to play any significant role in intrinsic or acquired resistance to MTX in childhood leukemia.

Fertility of long-term male survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed during childhood.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2004-04-01,"Fertility impairments among men treated during childhood for cancer are known to occur after some, but not all, types of anti-cancer therapy. This is the first study to evaluate proven fertility among adult male survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In a retrospective cohort study, proven fertility (ever fathered a pregnancy) was evaluated by self-report among 213 men treated for ALL before age 18 on protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG). Controls (N = 145) were drawn from among male siblings. Overall, with a proportional hazards analysis, proven fertility of male survivors was not different from that of controls (relative fertility (RF) = 0.95, 95% CI 0.63-1.43). However, married men treated before age 10 with high dose (24 cGy) cranial radiotherapy (RT), without spinal RT, had only 9% of the fertility of controls (Relative risk, RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.82). High dose cranial RT at older ages was not associated with a statistically significant fertility deficit (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.25-1.28).

"Utilization of Ig heavy chain variable, diversity, and joining gene segments in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia: implications for the mechanisms of VDJ recombination and for pathogenesis.",Blood,Blood,2004-03-09,"Sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH) has demonstrated preferential usage of specific variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes at different stages of B-cell development and in B-cell malignancies, and this has provided insight into B-cell maturation and selection. Knowledge of the association between rearrangement patterns based on updated databases and clinical characteristics of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is limited. We analyzed 381 IgH sequences identified at presentation in 317 children with B-lineage ALL and assessed the V(H)D(H)J(H) gene utilization profiles. The D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments and the D(H)2 gene family were significantly overrepresented. Only 21% of V(H)-J(H) joinings were potentially productive, a finding associated with a trend toward an increased risk of relapse. These results suggest that physical location at the V(H) locus is involved in preferential usage of D(H)J(H)-proximal V(H) segments whereas D(H) and J(H) segment usage is governed by position-independent molecular mechanisms.

Fertility in women treated with cranial radiotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2004-06-01,"Fertility impairments among women treated during childhood for cancer are known to occur after some, but not all, types of anticancer therapy. Although leukemia is the most common cancer of childhood, until now fertility in survivors has not been comprehensively assessed. We investigated functional impairment of fertility in women who were long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a retrospective cohort study. Proven fertility (defined as ever pregnant) was evaluated by self-report among 182 females treated on protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (age at interview, 22.6 years on average) and 170 controls drawn from among the survivors' female siblings (23.4 years). The interview included psychosocial inventories designed to detect mood problems. Significant fertility deficits were noted in female survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy (CRT) at any dose around the time of menarche (relative fertility (RF)) = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.82, P = 0.03). Controlling for marital status, mood at interview, and many fertility-related situations did not change the association.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with TEL-AML1 fusion has lower expression of genes involved in purine metabolism and lower de novo purine synthesis.,Blood,Blood,2004-05-13,"Because de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) is a target of widely used antileukemic agents (eg, methotrexate, mercaptopurine), we determined the rate of DNPS and the expression of genes involved in purine metabolism in different subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among 113 children with newly diagnosed ALL, lymphoblasts with the TEL-AML1 translocation had significantly lower DNPS than all other genetic subtypes of B-lineage ALL or T-lineage ALL (352 +/- 57 versus 1001 +/- 31 or versus 1315 +/- 76 fmol/nmol/h, P <.0001). By assessing the expression of 82 genes involved in purine metabolism (KEGG pathway database) in ALL blasts from 38 patients with B-lineage ALL (14 with TEL-AML1, 24 without), we identified 16 genes that were differentially expressed in TEL-AML1-positive and TEL-AML1-negative ALL (P <.001, false discovery rate [FDR] = 5%). The pattern of expression of these 16 genes discriminated TEL-AML1-positive ALL with a true accuracy of 84% in an independent test set (n = 17, confidence interval 70% to 94%, P <.001). Western blots of selected genes documented corresponding levels of the proteins encoded. Differentially expressed genes included HPRT, IMPDH, PAICS, and GART, all of which were expressed at a significantly lower level in TEL-AML1 ALL.

However, it is not known what effect these complications have on MTX clearance when they arise after the plasma MTX concentration has fallen to an undetectable level. We describe the clinical course and pharmacokinetics of MTX in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who experienced pleural effusions, ascites, and renal failure during the weeks after treatment with high-dose MTX (1.63 g/m2 i.v. over 24 h). The patient's normal initial MTX clearance rate (107 ml/min/m2) was consistent with his undetectable plasma level of MTX on day 9 after the infusion. His plasma MTX concentration then gradually increased as his renal function declined, reaching a peak of 0.72 microM on day 15. This unusual finding of an undetectable plasma MTX concentration that subsequently rose to persistent, potentially toxic levels was explained only by a pharmacokinetic model that accounted both for a third space at the time of treatment and for the subsequent decrease in the systemic elimination rate. Therefore, the finding of a physiologic third space during MTX administration combined with the detection of renal dysfunction in the following weeks should be an indication for prolonged therapeutic drug monitoring.",Case Reports,5726.0,23.0,Pleural effusions ascites renal dysfunction decrease plasma excretion methotrexate MTX known effect complications MTX clearance arise plasma MTX concentration fallen undetectable level clinical course pharmacokinetics MTX patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia experienced pleural effusions ascites renal failure weeks treatment high-dose MTX 1.63 g/m2 i.v 24 h patient 's normal initial MTX clearance rate 107 ml/min/m2 consistent undetectable plasma level MTX day 9 infusion plasma MTX concentration gradually increased renal function declined reaching peak 0.72 microM day 15 unusual finding undetectable plasma MTX concentration subsequently rose persistent potentially toxic levels explained pharmacokinetic model accounted space time treatment subsequent decrease systemic elimination rate finding physiologic space MTX administration combined detection renal dysfunction following weeks indication prolonged therapeutic drug monitoring,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2164, 5154, 3819, 2, 1527, 775, 3, 554, 8294, 1, 2116, 3453, 137, 192, 16, 44, 440, 2067, 254, 46, 521, 47, 23, 3453, 1960, 198, 491, 3043, 50, 3, 554, 3453, 1227, 71, 18310, 6, 35, 3920, 301, 21, 897, 3, 38, 906, 2, 1159, 1, 3453, 4, 8, 69, 5, 286, 1275, 54, 592, 2164, 5154, 3819, 2, 496, 190, 3, 244, 50, 24, 5, 64, 61, 3453, 14, 676, 499, 821, 70, 603, 252, 259, 555, 3, 69, 292, 295, 388, 3453, 1960, 116, 3650, 542, 1538, 821, 10, 925, 5, 3224, 3920, 554, 301, 1, 3453, 23, 218, 83, 50, 3, 904, 3224, 554, 3453, 1227, 818, 8092, 101, 22, 3224, 343, 3054, 6168, 8, 2944, 1, 13, 720, 3550, 23, 218, 167, 26, 4015, 1567, 1, 35, 3920, 554, 3453, 1227, 17, 1611, 7370, 6, 1882, 751, 1812, 148, 10, 3672, 158, 20, 8, 1456, 202, 17, 3688, 110, 9, 8, 1282, 3865, 28, 3, 98, 1, 24, 2, 9, 3, 706, 775, 4, 3, 403, 3730, 116, 673, 3, 1567, 1, 8, 4628, 1282, 3865, 190, 3453, 634, 397, 5, 3, 638, 1, 1527, 4, 3, 366, 244, 257, 40, 35, 3607, 9, 1069, 189, 234, 1315]",1262.0,15148625,Late-onset delayed excretion methotrexate,3,0.003278688524590164
Establishment of a pediatric oncology program and outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a resource-poor area.,JAMA,JAMA,2004-05-01,"The cure rate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) differs markedly between developed and developing countries. To assess the effect of a multidisciplinary team approach and protocol-based therapy on the event-free survival of children with ALL in an area with limited resources. DESIGN, POPULATION, AND SETTING: A retrospective cohort study at a pediatric hospital in the resource-poor city of Recife, Brazil. We reviewed medical records of the outcomes of 375 children with ALL diagnosed between 1980 and 2002. Eighty-three children were diagnosed in the early period (1980-1989), in the absence of a dedicated pediatric oncology unit, protocol-based therapy, specially trained nurses, 24-hour on-site physician coverage, and ready access to intensive care. Seventy-eight children were treated (all according to protocol) during the middle period (July 1994 to March 1997). During the recent period (April 1997 to December 2002), 214 children were treated with protocol in a dedicated pediatric oncology unit staffed 24 hours by pediatric oncologists and oncology nurses. Improvements were implemented gradually during the middle period and were completed during the recent period. Event-free survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Events included death from toxicity, disease progression or relapse, and abandonment of treatment. The 5-year event-free survival improved steadily: 32% (95% CI, 21%-43%) in the early period, 47% (95% CI, 36%-58%) in the middle period, and 63% (95% CI, 55%-71%) in the recent period. The probability of cause-specific treatment failure in the early, middle, and late periods, respectively, within 1 year of diagnosis was 14% vs 3.8% vs 3.3% for relapse; 6.0% vs 12% vs 9.8% for death from infection; 2.4% vs 13% vs 4.2% for death from noninfectious toxicity; and 16% vs 1.3% vs 0.5% for abandonment of therapy.

Outcome with the hyper-CVAD regimens in lymphoblastic lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2004-06-03,"Therapy of lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) has evolved with use of chemotherapy regimens modeled after those for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). We treated 33 patients with LL with the intensive chemotherapy regimens hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone) or modified hyper-CVAD used for ALL at our institution. Induction consolidation was administered with 8 or 9 alternating cycles of chemotherapy over 5 to 6 months with intrathecal chemotherapy prophylaxis, followed by maintenance therapy. Consolidative radiation therapy was given to patients with mediastinal disease at presentation. No consolidation with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed. At diagnosis, 80% were T-cell immunophenotype, 70% were stages III to IV, 70% had mediastinal involvement, and 9% had central nervous system (CNS) disease. Of the patients, 30 (91%) achieved complete remission, and 3 (9%) achieved partial response. Within a median of 13 months, 10 patients (30%) relapsed or progressed. Estimates for 3-year progression-free and overall survival for the 33 patients were 66% and 70%, respectively. Estimates for the patients with known T-cell immunophenotype were 62% and 67%, respectively.

Identifying and characterizing a novel activating mutation of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase in AML.,Blood,Blood,2004-06-03,"The FLT3 receptor is activated by juxtamembrane insertion mutations and by activation loop point mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In a systematic tyrosine kinase gene exon resequencing study, 21 of 24 FLT3 exons were sequenced in samples from 53 patients with AML, 9 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 3 patients with myelodysplasia samples. Three patients had novel point mutations at residue N841 that resulted in a change to isoleucine in 2 samples and to tyrosine in 1 sample. Introduction of FLT3-N841I cDNA into Ba/F3 cells led to interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent proliferation, receptor phosphorylation, and constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK), suggesting that the N841I mutation confers constitutive activity to the receptor. An FLT3 inhibitor (PKC412) inhibited the growth of Ba/F3-FLT3N841I cells (IC(50) 10 nM), but not of wild-type Ba/F3 cells cultured with IL-3. PKC412 also reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor and inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation. Examination of the FLT3 autoinhibited structure showed that N841 is the key residue in a hydrogen-bonding network that likely stabilizes the activation loop. These results suggest that mutations at N841 represent a significant new activating mutation in patients with AML and that patients with such mutations may respond to small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412.",Journal Article,5710.0,68.0,FLT3 receptor activated juxtamembrane insertion activation loop point patients acute myeloid leukemia AML systematic tyrosine kinase exon resequencing 21 24 FLT3 exons sequenced 53 patients AML 9 patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia 3 patients myelodysplasia patients novel point residue N841 resulted change isoleucine 2 tyrosine 1 Introduction FLT3-N841I cDNA Ba/F3 led interleukin-3 IL-3 -independent proliferation receptor phosphorylation constitutive activation signal transducer activator transcription 5 STAT5 extracellular regulatory kinase ERK suggesting N841I confers constitutive activity receptor FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 inhibited growth Ba/F3-FLT3N841I IC 50 10 nM wild-type Ba/F3 cultured IL-3 PKC412 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation receptor inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation Examination FLT3 autoinhibited structure showed N841 key residue hydrogen-bonding network likely stabilizes activation loop suggest N841 represent significant new activating patients AML patients respond small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors PKC412,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1224, 153, 16, 735, 20, 10541, 5099, 138, 2, 20, 363, 4432, 741, 138, 4, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 4, 8, 1556, 564, 216, 145, 1725, 11819, 45, 239, 1, 259, 1224, 3885, 11, 4040, 4, 347, 29, 699, 7, 5, 329, 83, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 27, 7, 5, 6128, 347, 169, 7, 42, 229, 741, 138, 28, 7840, 37702, 17, 627, 4, 8, 707, 6, 21250, 4, 18, 347, 2, 6, 564, 4, 14, 1000, 2456, 1, 1224, 43626, 4212, 237, 6669, 6904, 37, 836, 6, 1603, 27, 501, 27, 306, 457, 153, 982, 2, 3178, 363, 1, 1235, 5182, 2, 3393, 1, 866, 33, 5517, 2, 1976, 1253, 216, 1819, 802, 17, 3, 43626, 258, 4020, 3178, 128, 6, 3, 153, 35, 1224, 230, 7154, 879, 3, 129, 1, 6669, 6904, 54203, 37, 2340, 212, 79, 2878, 84, 44, 1, 955, 267, 6669, 6904, 37, 3197, 5, 501, 27, 7154, 120, 405, 564, 982, 1, 3, 620, 153, 2, 879, 5517, 982, 1385, 1, 3, 1224, 33685, 2772, 224, 17, 37702, 16, 3, 825, 7840, 4, 8, 12808, 28239, 1801, 17, 322, 11019, 3, 363, 4432, 46, 99, 309, 17, 138, 28, 37702, 1231, 8, 93, 217, 1616, 258, 4, 7, 5, 329, 2, 17, 7, 5, 225, 138, 68, 1892, 6, 302, 1354, 1224, 222, 225, 22, 7154]",1440.0,15178581,Identifying characterizing novel activating FLT3 tyrosine kinase AML,2,0.002185792349726776
Histone deacetylase inhibition improves dendritic cell differentiation of leukemic blasts with AML1-containing fusion proteins.,Journal of leukocyte biology,J. Leukoc. Biol.,2004-06-14,"Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in leukemic blasts make these an attractive source for dendritic cells (DC) to induce a leukemia-specific immune response. In this study, three leukemic cell lines were investigated: Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 (two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines carrying the (8;21)-chromosomal translocation, resulting in the expression of the leukemia-specific fusion protein AML1-eight-twenty-one) and REH, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line with the (12;21)-chromosomal translocation and expression of translocation ETS-like leukemia-AML1. These fusion proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of the leukemic state by recruiting corepressors and histone deacetylases (HDAC), which interfere with normal cell differentiation. In vitro generation of DC was achieved using a cytokine cocktail containing tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, c-kit ligand, and soluble CD40 ligand; yet, addition of the HDAC inhibitor (Hdi) trichostatin A enhanced DC differentiation with retention of the fusion transcripts. These leukemic DC showed high-level CD83 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and had a high allostimulatory potential. Only DC generated from these cell lines after Hdi induced blast-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in HLA-A-matched T cells with a cytotoxicity of 42% in parental Kasumi-1 and 83% in parental REH cells, respectively.

Gene expression profiling of pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2004-06-29,"Contemporary treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires the assignment of patients to specific risk groups. To explore whether expression profiling of leukemic blasts could accurately distinguish between the known risk groups of AML, we analyzed 130 pediatric and 20 adult AML diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using the Affymetrix U133A microarray. Class discriminating genes were identified for each of the major prognostic subtypes of pediatric AML, including t(15;17)[PML-RARalpha], t(8;21)[AML1-ETO], inv(16) [CBFbeta-MYH11], MLL chimeric fusion genes, and cases classified as FAB-M7. When subsets of these genes were used in supervised learning algorithms, an overall classification accuracy of more than 93% was achieved. Moreover, we were able to use the expression signatures generated from the pediatric samples to accurately classify adult de novo AMLs with the same genetic lesions. The class discriminating genes also provided novel insights into the molecular pathobiology of these leukemias. Finally, using a combined pediatric data set of 130 AMLs and 137 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, we identified an expression signature for cases with MLL chimeric fusion genes irrespective of lineage.

Outcomes of a randomized trial of hyperfractionated cranial radiation therapy for treatment of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia: therapeutic efficacy and neurotoxicity.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-07-01,"We evaluated 8-year survival and late neuropsychologic toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated in a randomized clinical trial to test whether hyperfractionated (twice daily) cranial radiation therapy (CRT) can reduce incidence and severity of late toxicities associated with 18 Gy of CRT. Between 1987 and 1995, 369 children treated on two consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium protocols for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia were randomly assigned to conventionally fractionated CRT (CFX) or hyperfractionated CRT (HFX) to a total dose of 18 Gy. Neuropsychologic testing was completed for 125 of 287 children in continuous complete remission. Event-free and overall survival, as well as neuropsychologic function, were compared for the two arms of the protocol. Eight-year event-free survival (+/- SE) was 80% +/- 3% for children randomly assigned to CFX and 72% +/- 3% for HFX (P =.06). Overall survival was 85% +/- 3% for CFX and 78% +/- 3% for HFX (P =.06). CNS relapses occurred in 2.8% of patients receiving CFX and 2.7% receiving HFX (P =.99).

Parental exposure to medications and hydrocarbons and ras mutations in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2004-07-01,"Ras proto-oncogene mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many malignancies, including leukemia. While both human and animal studies have linked several chemical carcinogens to specific ras mutations, little data exist regarding the association of ras mutations with parental exposures and risk of childhood leukemia. Using data from a large case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; age <15 years) conducted by the Children's Cancer Group, we used a case-case comparison approach to examine whether reported parental exposure to hydrocarbons at work or use of specific medications are related to ras gene mutations in the leukemia cells of children with ALL. DNA was extracted from archived bone marrow slides or cryopreserved marrow samples for 837 ALL cases. We examined mutations in K-ras and N-ras genes at codons 12, 13, and 61 by PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and confirmed them by DNA sequencing. We interviewed mothers and, if available, fathers by telephone to collect exposure information. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from logistic regression to examine the association of parental exposures with ras mutations. A total of 127 (15.2%) cases had ras mutations (K-ras 4.7% and N-ras 10.68%). Both maternal (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7-6.1) and paternal (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) reported use of mind-altering drugs were associated with N-ras mutations. Paternal use of amphetamines or diet pills was associated with N-ras mutations (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-15.0); no association was observed with maternal use. Maternal exposure to solvents (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.7) and plastic materials (OR 6.9, 95% CI 1.2-39.7) during pregnancy and plastic materials after pregnancy (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.4-48.8) were related to K-ras mutation. Maternal ever exposure to oil and coal products before case diagnosis (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.8) and during the postnatal period (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-5.5) and paternal exposure to plastic materials before index pregnancy (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.1) and other hydrocarbons during the postnatal period (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) were associated with N-ras mutations. This study suggests that parental exposure to specific chemicals may be associated with distinct ras mutations in children who develop ALL.",Journal Article,5682.0,40.0,Ras proto-oncogene implicated pathogenesis malignancies including leukemia human animal studies linked chemical carcinogens specific ras little exist association ras parental exposures risk childhood leukemia large case-control childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia age 15 years conducted Children 's Group case-case comparison approach examine reported parental exposure hydrocarbons work use specific medications related ras leukemia children DNA extracted archived bone marrow slides cryopreserved marrow 837 cases examined K-ras N-ras codons 12 13 61 PCR allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed DNA sequencing interviewed mothers available fathers telephone collect exposure information Odds ratios ORs 95 confidence intervals CIs derived logistic regression examine association parental exposures ras total 127 15.2 cases ras K-ras 4.7 N-ras 10.68 maternal 3.2 95 CI 1.7-6.1 paternal 2.0 95 CI 1.1-3.7 reported use mind-altering drugs associated N-ras Paternal use amphetamines diet pills associated N-ras 4.1 95 CI 1.1-15.0 association observed maternal use Maternal exposure solvents 3.1 95 CI 1.0-9.7 plastic materials 6.9 95 CI 1.2-39.7 pregnancy plastic materials pregnancy 8.3 95 CI 1.4-48.8 related K-ras Maternal exposure oil coal products case diagnosis 2.3 95 CI 1.1-4.8 postnatal period 2.2 95 CI 1.0-5.5 paternal exposure plastic materials index pregnancy 2.4 95 CI 1.1-5.1 hydrocarbons postnatal period 1.8 95 CI 1.0-1.3 associated N-ras suggests parental exposure specific chemicals associated distinct ras children develop,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1102, 4976, 1836, 138, 47, 85, 1771, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 445, 441, 141, 369, 110, 171, 2, 2026, 94, 47, 1199, 392, 3743, 8850, 6, 112, 1102, 138, 1215, 74, 1923, 666, 3, 248, 1, 1102, 138, 5, 3418, 3401, 2, 43, 1, 864, 75, 74, 29, 8, 375, 473, 182, 45, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 89, 167, 60, 426, 20, 3, 541, 292, 12, 87, 21, 95, 8, 473, 473, 1155, 353, 6, 1004, 317, 210, 3418, 645, 6, 28258, 28, 1357, 15, 119, 1, 112, 2679, 32, 139, 6, 1102, 145, 138, 4, 3, 37, 1, 541, 5, 62, 261, 10, 2484, 29, 6282, 581, 3830, 15, 10432, 581, 347, 9, 17243, 62, 140, 21, 409, 138, 4, 1634, 1102, 2, 78, 1102, 214, 28, 9107, 133, 233, 2, 713, 20, 604, 2, 1254, 112, 4727, 1554, 2, 557, 1370, 20, 261, 615, 21, 6713, 8605, 2, 492, 390, 17271, 20, 4258, 6, 6248, 645, 487, 610, 1137, 3694, 2, 48, 307, 1582, 1927, 11, 526, 29, 812, 320, 6, 1004, 3, 248, 1, 3418, 3401, 5, 1102, 138, 8, 181, 1, 4080, 167, 18, 140, 42, 1102, 138, 1634, 1102, 39, 67, 2, 78, 1102, 79, 806, 110, 6039, 15, 27, 18, 48, 58, 14, 67, 49, 14, 2, 10649, 15, 18, 13, 48, 58, 14, 14, 27, 67, 210, 119, 1, 8090, 4831, 600, 11, 41, 5, 78, 1102, 138, 10649, 119, 1, 37281, 15, 2453, 17655, 10, 41, 5, 78, 1102, 138, 15, 39, 14, 48, 58, 14, 14, 167, 13, 77, 248, 10, 164, 5, 6039, 119, 6039, 645, 6, 24732, 15, 27, 14, 48, 58, 14, 13, 83, 67, 2, 7409, 5102, 15, 49, 83, 48, 58, 14, 18, 587, 67, 190, 2290, 2, 7409, 5102, 50, 2290, 15, 66, 27, 48, 58, 14, 39, 576, 66, 11, 139, 6, 1634, 1102, 258, 6039, 3353, 645, 6, 9481, 2, 37730, 2766, 348, 473, 147, 15, 18, 27, 48, 58, 14, 14, 39, 66, 2, 190, 3, 15472, 727, 15, 18, 18, 48, 58, 14, 13, 33, 33, 2, 10649, 645, 6, 7409, 5102, 348, 558, 2290, 15, 18, 39, 48, 58, 14, 14, 33, 14, 2, 127, 28258, 190, 3, 15472, 727, 15, 14, 66, 48, 58, 14, 13, 14, 27, 11, 41, 5, 78, 1102, 138, 26, 45, 844, 17, 3418, 645, 6, 112, 14226, 68, 40, 41, 5, 834, 1102, 138, 4, 541, 54, 690, 62]",2202.0,15247135,Parental exposure medications hydrocarbons ras children acute lymphoblastic leukemia report Children 's Oncology Group,0,0.0
The effect of dexrazoxane on myocardial injury in doxorubicin-treated children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2004-07-01,"Doxorubicin chemotherapy is very effective in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but also injures myocardial cells. Dexrazoxane, a free-radical scavenger, may protect the heart from doxorubicin-associated damage. To determine whether dexrazoxane decreases doxorubicin-associated injury of cardiomyocytes, we randomly assigned 101 children with ALL to receive doxorubicin alone (30 mg per square meter of body-surface area every three weeks for 10 doses) and 105 to receive dexrazoxane (300 mg per square meter) followed immediately by doxorubicin. Serial measurements of serum cardiac troponin T were obtained in 76 of 101 patients in the doxorubicin group and 82 of 105 patients in the group given dexrazoxane and doxorubicin. A total of 2377 serum samples (mean, 15.1 samples per patient) were obtained before, during, and after treatment with doxorubicin. Troponin T levels were evaluated in a blinded fashion to determine whether they were elevated (>0.01 ng per milliliter)--the primary end point--or extremely elevated (>0.025 ng per milliliter). Elevations of troponin T occurred in 35 percent of the patients (55 of 158). Patients treated with doxorubicin alone were more likely than those who received dexrazoxane and doxorubicin to have elevated troponin T levels (50 percent vs. 21 percent, P<0.001) and extremely elevated troponin T levels (32 percent vs. 10 percent, P<0.001). The median follow-up was 2.7 years. The rate of event-free survival at 2.5 years was 83 percent in both groups (P=0.87 by the log-rank test). Dexrazoxane prevents or reduces cardiac injury, as reflected by elevations in troponin T, that is associated with the use of doxorubicin for childhood ALL without compromising the antileukemic efficacy of doxorubicin. Longer follow-up will be necessary to determine the influence of dexrazoxane on echocardiographic findings at four years and on event-free survival.",Clinical Trial,5682.0,420.0,Doxorubicin chemotherapy effective children acute lymphoblastic leukemia injures myocardial Dexrazoxane free-radical scavenger protect heart doxorubicin-associated damage determine dexrazoxane decreases doxorubicin-associated injury cardiomyocytes randomly assigned 101 children receive doxorubicin 30 mg square meter body-surface area weeks 10 doses 105 receive dexrazoxane 300 mg square meter followed immediately doxorubicin Serial measurements serum cardiac troponin obtained 76 101 patients doxorubicin group 82 105 patients group given dexrazoxane doxorubicin total 2377 serum mean 15.1 patient obtained treatment doxorubicin Troponin levels evaluated blinded fashion determine elevated 0.01 ng milliliter -- primary end point -- extremely elevated 0.025 ng milliliter Elevations troponin occurred 35 percent patients 55 158 Patients treated doxorubicin likely received dexrazoxane doxorubicin elevated troponin levels 50 percent vs. 21 percent P 0.001 extremely elevated troponin levels 32 percent vs. 10 percent P 0.001 median follow-up 2.7 years rate event-free survival 2.5 years 83 percent groups P=0.87 log-rank test Dexrazoxane prevents reduces cardiac injury reflected elevations troponin associated use doxorubicin childhood compromising antileukemic efficacy doxorubicin Longer follow-up necessary determine influence dexrazoxane echocardiographic findings years event-free survival,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[856, 56, 16, 923, 323, 4, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 84, 120, 43660, 5098, 37, 8473, 8, 115, 711, 12545, 68, 4869, 3, 29, 856, 41, 1350, 6, 223, 317, 8473, 2140, 856, 41, 2730, 1, 30627, 21, 1108, 896, 2338, 541, 5, 62, 6, 560, 856, 279, 201, 81, 379, 3219, 8591, 1, 642, 1255, 965, 454, 169, 244, 9, 79, 415, 2, 3263, 6, 560, 8473, 2036, 81, 379, 3219, 8591, 370, 3467, 20, 856, 2108, 1685, 1, 524, 9092, 102, 11, 683, 4, 846, 1, 2338, 7, 4, 3, 856, 87, 2, 878, 1, 3263, 7, 4, 3, 87, 447, 8473, 2, 856, 8, 181, 1, 30628, 524, 347, 313, 167, 14, 347, 379, 69, 11, 683, 348, 190, 2, 50, 24, 5, 856, 9092, 102, 148, 11, 194, 4, 8, 3288, 3240, 6, 223, 317, 491, 11, 804, 13, 355, 997, 379, 14835, 3, 86, 396, 741, 15, 2938, 804, 13, 4067, 997, 379, 14835, 4712, 1, 9092, 102, 489, 4, 465, 714, 1, 3, 7, 614, 1, 5162, 7, 73, 5, 856, 279, 11, 80, 322, 76, 135, 54, 103, 8473, 2, 856, 6, 47, 804, 9092, 102, 148, 212, 714, 105, 239, 714, 19, 13, 144, 2, 2938, 804, 9092, 102, 148, 531, 714, 105, 79, 714, 19, 13, 144, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 18, 67, 60, 3, 116, 1, 774, 115, 25, 28, 18, 33, 60, 10, 852, 714, 4, 110, 271, 19, 13, 912, 20, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 8473, 5217, 15, 2389, 2730, 22, 4686, 20, 4712, 4, 9092, 102, 17, 16, 41, 5, 3, 119, 1, 856, 9, 864, 62, 187, 6102, 3, 4512, 209, 1, 856, 589, 166, 126, 303, 40, 1493, 6, 223, 3, 1054, 1, 8473, 23, 13220, 272, 28, 294, 60, 2, 23, 774, 115, 25]",1841.0,15247354,effect dexrazoxane myocardial injury doxorubicin-treated children acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Improved outcome for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of Total Therapy Study XIIIB at St Jude Children's Research Hospital.,Blood,Blood,2004-07-13,"St Jude Total Therapy Study XIIIB for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) incorporated more stringent risk classification, early intensification of intrathecal chemotherapy, reinduction treatment, and the addition of dexamethasone to postremission therapy to increase the proportion of event-free survivors without jeopardizing their quality of life. Cranial irradiation was reserved for the 12% of patients who had T-cell ALL and a presenting leukocyte count of 100 x 10(9)/L or more, or CNS-3 (5 or more leukocytes/microL with identifiable blast cells in an atraumatic sample or the presence of cranial nerve palsy) status. Among the 247 consecutive patients enrolled in the study, 117 were classified as having lower-risk leukemia and received mainly antimetabolite-based continuation therapy; the 130 cases with higher-risk leukemia received more intensive continuation chemotherapy with multiple drug pairs administered in weekly rotation. The 5-year event-free survival estimate was 80.8% +/- 2.6% (SE); the 8-year rate was 78.6% +/- 5.8%. The 5-year cumulative risk of an isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse was 1.7% +/- 0.8%, and that of isolated plus combined CNS relapse was 3.0% +/- 1.1%.

Gene-expression patterns in drug-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and response to treatment.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2004-08-01,"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is curable with chemotherapy in approximately 80 percent of patients. However, the cause of treatment failure in the remaining 20 percent of patients is largely unknown. We tested leukemia cells from 173 children for sensitivity in vitro to prednisolone, vincristine, asparaginase, and daunorubicin. The cells were then subjected to an assessment of gene expression with the use of 14,500 probe sets to identify differentially expressed genes in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ALL. Gene-expression patterns that differed according to sensitivity or resistance to the four drugs were compared with treatment outcome in the original 173 patients and an independent cohort of 98 children treated with the same drugs at another institution. We identified sets of differentially expressed genes in B-lineage ALL that were sensitive or resistant to prednisolone (33 genes), vincristine (40 genes), asparaginase (35 genes), or daunorubicin (20 genes). A combined gene-expression score of resistance to the four drugs, as compared with sensitivity to the four, was significantly and independently related to treatment outcome in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for relapse, 3.0; P=0.027). Results were confirmed in an independent population of patients treated with the same medications (hazard ratio for relapse, 11.85; P=0.019). Of the 124 genes identified, 121 have not previously been associated with resistance to the four drugs we tested.

Genetic variation in the leptin receptor gene and obesity in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-09-01,"Overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 to 29 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI > or = 30 kg/m2) frequently follow treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recent studies suggest that risk is most apparent in females treated with cranial radiation at a younger age. Because radiation at a young age may affect the hypothalamus causing leptin receptor insensitivity, we hypothesized that a polymorphism in the leptin receptor (LEPR) gene, Gln223Arg, might influence susceptibility to obesity in survivors of childhood ALL. We genotyped 600 non-Hispanic white adult ALL survivors enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. BMI was compared between those with two copies of the Arg allele to those who had at least one copy of the Gln allele. Female survivors with BMI > or = 25 kg/m2 were more likely Arg homozygous than those with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 (24% v 12%; P =.007). This difference was not observed in males. Moreover, among females treated with > or = 20 Gy cranial radiation, Arg/Arg individuals had six times higher odds of having BMI > or = 25 kg/m2 (95% CI, 2.1 to 22.0) than those with a Gln allele (P =.04 for interaction). CONCLUSION LEPR polymorphism may influence obesity in female survivors of childhood ALL, particularly those exposed to cranial radiation.

FLT3 inhibition selectively kills childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with high levels of FLT3 expression.,Blood,Blood,2004-09-16,"FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is almost universally expressed in B-precursor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cases of ALL with MLL gene rearrangements and those with high hyperdiploidy (> 50 chromosomes) express the highest levels of FLT3, and activating mutations of FLT3 occur in 18% of MLL-rearranged and 28% of hyperdiploid ALL cases. We determined the antileukemic activity of CEP-701, a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor, in 8 ALL cell lines and 39 bone marrow samples obtained at diagnosis from infants and children with various subtypes of ALL. CEP-701 induced pronounced apoptotic responses in a higher percentage of samples that expressed high levels of FLT3 (74%, n = 23) compared with samples with low levels of expression (8%, n = 13; P = .0003). Sensitivity to FLT3 inhibition was particularly high in samples with MLL gene rearrangements (82%, n = 11; P = .0005), high hyperdiploidy (100%, n = 5; P = .0007), and/or FLT3 mutations (100%, n = 4; P = .0021).

Prediction of resistance to small molecule FLT3 inhibitors: implications for molecularly targeted therapy of acute leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-09-01,"Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur frequently in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Small molecules that selectively inhibit FLT3 kinase activity induce apoptosis in blasts from AML patients with FLT3 mutations and prolong survival in animal models of FLT3-induced myeloproliferative disease. A spectrum of structurally different small molecules with activity against FLT3 have been described, and their efficacy for treatment of AML and ALL is now being investigated in clinical trials. Here, we describe the results of an in vitro screen designed to identify mutations in the ATP-binding pocket of FLT3 that confer resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Mutations at four different positions (Ala-627, Asn-676, Phe-691, and Gly-697) were identified that confer varying degrees of resistance to PKC412, SU5614, or K-252a. FLT3 proteins mutated at Ala-627, Asn-676, or Phe-691 remained sensitive to higher concentrations of the inhibitors, but the G697R mutation conferred high-level resistance to each of these inhibitors as well as to six additional experimental inhibitors. These data provide insights into potential mechanisms of acquired resistance of FLT3 to small molecule inhibitors and indicate that the G697R mutation may be a clinically problematic resistance mutation that warrants proactive screening for additional inhibitors.",Journal Article,5620.0,136.0,receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur frequently patients acute myeloid leukemia AML acute lymphoblastic leukemia Small molecules selectively inhibit FLT3 kinase activity induce apoptosis blasts AML patients FLT3 prolong survival animal models FLT3-induced myeloproliferative disease spectrum structurally different small molecules activity FLT3 described efficacy treatment AML investigated clinical trials vitro screen designed identify ATP-binding pocket FLT3 confer resistance tyrosine kinase inhibitors different positions Ala-627 Asn-676 Phe-691 Gly-697 identified confer varying degrees resistance PKC412 SU5614 K-252a FLT3 Ala-627 Asn-676 Phe-691 remained sensitive higher concentrations inhibitors G697R conferred high-level resistance inhibitors additional experimental inhibitors provide insights potential mechanisms acquired resistance FLT3 small molecule inhibitors indicate G697R clinically problematic resistance warrants proactive screening additional inhibitors,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[138, 4, 3, 153, 564, 216, 1224, 1271, 746, 4, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 2, 286, 1275, 62, 302, 1598, 17, 2382, 1433, 1224, 216, 128, 1290, 351, 4, 2438, 29, 329, 7, 5, 1224, 138, 2, 3615, 25, 4, 2026, 274, 1, 1224, 277, 34, 8, 1873, 1, 8533, 338, 302, 1598, 5, 128, 480, 1224, 47, 85, 1027, 2, 136, 209, 9, 24, 1, 329, 2, 62, 16, 1134, 486, 565, 4, 38, 143, 467, 21, 897, 3, 99, 1, 35, 4, 439, 2413, 1114, 6, 255, 138, 4, 3, 3918, 791, 6575, 1, 1224, 17, 2913, 251, 6, 564, 216, 222, 138, 28, 294, 338, 7134, 8497, 13598, 18888, 11010, 15139, 11661, 2, 14477, 11989, 11, 108, 17, 2913, 2990, 4133, 1, 251, 6, 7154, 54365, 15, 1634, 54366, 1224, 652, 1185, 28, 8497, 13598, 18888, 11010, 15, 15139, 11661, 958, 745, 6, 142, 1003, 1, 3, 222, 84, 3, 43720, 258, 3851, 64, 301, 251, 6, 296, 1, 46, 222, 22, 149, 22, 6, 437, 402, 1560, 222, 46, 74, 377, 1957, 237, 174, 483, 1, 1294, 251, 1, 1224, 6, 302, 1354, 222, 2, 1008, 17, 3, 43720, 258, 68, 40, 8, 505, 6594, 251, 258, 17, 2782, 11662, 453, 9, 402, 222]",1349.0,15374944,Prediction resistance small molecule FLT3 inhibitors implications molecularly targeted therapy acute leukemia,43,0.046994535519125684
Death during induction therapy and first remission of acute leukemia in childhood: the St. Jude experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-10-01,"Despite improvements in supportive care, death due to treatment toxicity remains a significant problem for children treated for acute leukemia. To determine the causes of and risk factors for death unrelated to refractory leukemia, to disease recurrence, or to second malignancy, the authors reviewed the records of 1011 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 260 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated between 1984 and 1999 and between 1983 and 2002, respectively, at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). Data for patients who underwent stem cell transplantation were censored at the time of transplantation. For patients with ALL, the estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of death was 2.9% +/- 5.3%. Age was the only predictor of death. Patients with ALL 1-9 years old had a significantly lower risk of death than did younger or older patients (P = 0.002). For patients with AML, the estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of death was 7.6% +/- 1.9%. Increasing age and increasing leukocyte count were significantly associated with increased risk of death. For patients with ALL and with AML, the incidence of death remained relatively constant during the time periods studied. Infection was the most common cause of death.

We compared attainment of second remission and survival after relapse among patients who were asymptomatic and diagnosed by routine blood count, those who had symptoms suggestive of relapse and were diagnosed at the time of a scheduled follow-up, and those whose relapse was diagnosed because of the appearance of symptoms. Only 11% of patients who suffered a relapse were asymptomatic at the time of relapse and diagnosed solely by routine blood counts.

Pharmacogenetic risk factors for osteonecrosis of the hip among children with leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin.

Putative risk factors for osteonecrosis have included being female, white race, and older age.

Using a candidate gene approach, we determined the genotypes for 16 common polymorphisms in genes likely to affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic medications in 64 children with ALL. Therapy included glucocorticoids and antifolates.

In addition to age older than 10 years (odds ratio [OR], 24.2; P =.0001) and white race (OR, 11.1; P =.037), host factors for osteonecrosis included the vitamin D receptor FokI start site CC genotype (OR, 4.5; P =.045), and the thymidylate synthase low activity 2/2 enhancer repeat genotype (OR, 7.4; P =.049).

Results of a phase 1-2 study of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine (ara-C) in relapsed and refractory acute leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2004-10-14,"Clofarabine (2-chloro-2'-fluoro-deoxy-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is a second-generation nucleoside analog with activity in acute leukemias. As clofarabine is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RnR), we hypothesized that clofarabine will modulate ara-c triphosphate accumulation and increase the antileukemic activity of cytarabine (ara-C). We conducted a phase 1-2 study of clofarabine plus ara-C in 32 patients with relapsed acute leukemia (25 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 4 high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 1 blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).(1) Clofarabine was given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 2 through 6) followed 4 hours later by ara-C at 1 g/m(2) per day as a 2-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 1 through 5). The phase 2 dose of clofarabine was 40 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days. Among all patients, 7 (22%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 5 (16%) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 38%. No responses occurred in 3 patients with ALL and CML. One patient (3%) died during induction. Adverse events were mainly less than or equal to grade 2, including transient liver test abnormalities, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, mucositis, and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesias. Plasma clofarabine levels generated clofarabine triphosphate accumulation, which resulted in an increase in ara-CTP in the leukemic blasts.

To examine submicroscopic deletions at this locus, we analyzed 78 adult precursor B- and T-cell ALL cases [27 with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative B-cell ALL, 20 with Ph-negative B-cell ALL with expression of one or two myeloid markers, 18 with Ph-positive B-cell ALL, and 13 with T-cell ALL] using a panel of 13 microsatellite (MST) markers that span the 12q12-q14.3 region. The status of MST markers was evaluated by use of polymerase chain reaction performed with fluorescence-labeled primers and automated fragment analysis. The MST marker analyses showed submicroscopic deletions at the 12q14.3 locus in 20 of the 78 ALL cases (26%). The frequency of deletions was highest in Ph-negative B-cell ALL (13 of 27, 48%) compared with that in Ph-negative B-cell ALL with expression of myeloid markers (4 of 20, 20%), Ph-positive B-cell ALL (2 of 18, 11%), and T-cell ALL (1 of 13, 8%).

Cancer Res.,2004-10-01,"A novel regimen designed to maximize antileukemia activity of carboplatin through inhibiting repair of platinum-DNA adducts was conducted in poor prognosis, acute leukemia patients. Patients received fludarabine (10 to 15 mg/m(2) x 5 days), carboplatin (area under the curve 10 to 12 by continuous infusion over 5 days), followed by escalated doses of topotecan infused over 72 hours (fludarabine, carboplatin, topotecan regimen). Twenty-eight patients had acute myelogenous leukemia (7 untreated secondary acute myelogenous leukemia, 11 in first relapse, and 10 in second relapse or refractory), 1 patient had refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 2 patients had untreated chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis. Six patients had failed an autologous stem cell transplant. Patients ranged from 19 to 76 (median 54) years. Measurement of platinum-DNA adducts were done in serial bone marrow specimens. Fifteen of 31 patients achieved bone marrow aplasia. Clinical responses included 2 complete response, 4 complete response with persistent thrombocytopenia, and 2 partial response.

Lymphoid gene expression as a predictor of risk of secondary brain tumors.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2005-02-01,"Gene expression profiles are tissue-specific but may also reflect germ-line-driven expression patterns across tissue types. Previously, using a targeted pharmacologic approach, we identified germ-line polymorphisms in a single gene (thiopurine methyltransferase) associated with the risk of irradiation- and chemotherapy-induced secondary brain tumors in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To identify additional candidate genetic risk factors, in identically treated patients, we compared the gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts of those who did develop irradiation-associated brain tumors (n = 9) with the profiles from those who did not (n = 33). Weighted rank regression was used to identify 33 probe sets associated with the time-dependent development of brain tumors; k-means clustering (k = 2) identified 2 groups that differed significantly in cumulative incidence of brain tumors (P = 0.012). Permutation analysis was used to estimate the probability (P = 0.18) of obtaining 2 such clusters by chance. Linear discriminant analysis (time-independent categorization of outcome) was used to identify 70 probe sets whose expression differentiated between the 2 groups of patients.

Early complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting with hyperleukocytosis.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-07-01,"The optimal management of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with hyperleukocytosis is unclear, largely because the risk of leukostasis-related complications is poorly characterized. We reviewed the presenting characteristics, initial management, and frequency and type of complications in all children seen at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with previously untreated ALL and an initial leukocyte count >200 x 10(9)/L. A total of 178 children, representing 8% of all children with ALL, had an initial leukocyte count >200 x 10(9)/L; 67 patients had a leukocyte count >400 x 10(9)/L. Sixteen patients (9%) had neurological complications with 12 of these patients experiencing symptoms at presentation. Four patients (2%), all with initial leukocyte counts >400 x 10(9)/L, suffered a CNS hemorrhage. Pulmonary leukostasis occurred in 11 patients (6%). The degree of hyperleukocytosis was significantly predictive of neurological (P = 0.006) and respiratory (P = 0.014) complications. The majority of complications occurred at presentation. Cytoreduction (94 patients) decreased the leukocyte count but delayed initiation of chemotherapy (P = 0.013). Serious leukostasis-related complications are relatively uncommon in childhood ALL and most occur at presentation. Their incidence increases in proportion to the leukocyte count. A large subset of cases can be managed successfully without cytoreduction.

Childhood and adolescent lymphoid and myeloid leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2004-01-01,"Remarkable progress has been made in the past decade in the treatment and in the understanding of the biology of childhood lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. With contemporary improved risk assessment, chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and supportive care, approximately 80% of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 50% of those with myeloid neoplasm can be cured to date. Current emphasis is placed not only on increased cure rate but also on improved quality of life. In Section I, Dr. Ching-Hon Pui describes certain clinical and biologic features that still have prognostic and therapeutic relevance in the context of contemporary treatment programs. He emphasizes that treatment failure in some patients is not due to intrinsic drug resistance of leukemic cells but is rather caused by suboptimal drug dosing due to host compliance, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics. Hence, measurement of minimal residual disease, which accounts for both the genetic (primary and secondary) features of leukemic lymphoblasts and pharmacogenomic variables of the host, is the most reliable prognostic indicator. Finally, he contends that with optimal risk-directed systemic and intrathecal therapy, cranial irradiation may be omitted in all patients, regardless of the presenting features. In Section II, Dr. Martin Schrappe performs detailed analyses of the prognostic impact of presenting age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype, genetic abnormality, early treatment response, and in vitro drug sensitivity/resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on the large database of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster consortium. He also succinctly summarizes the important treatment components resulting in the improved outcome of children and young adolescents with this disease. He describes the treatment approach that led to the improved outcome of adolescent patients, a finding that may be applied to young adults in the second and third decade of life. Finally, he believes that treatment reduction under well-controlled clinical trials is feasible in a subgroup of patients with excellent early treatment response as evidenced by minimal residual disease measurement during induction and consolidation therapy. In Section III, Dr. Raul Ribeiro describes distinct morphologic and genetic subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. The finding of essentially identical gene expression profiling by DNA microarray in certain specific genetic subtypes of childhood and adult acute myeloid leukemia suggests a shared leukemogenesis. He then describes the principles of treatment as well as the efficacy and toxicity of various forms of postremission therapy, emphasizing the need of tailoring therapy to both the disease and the age of the patient. Early results suggest that minimal residual disease measurement can also improve the risk assessment in acute myeloid leukemia, and that cranial irradiation can be omitted even in those with central-nervous-system leukemia at diagnosis. In Section IV, Dr. Charlotte Niemeyer describes a new classification of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases in childhood, which has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recent discovery of somatic mutations in PTPN11 has improved the understanding of the pathobiology and the diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Together with the findings of mutations in RAS and NF1 in the other patients, she suggests that pathological activation of RAS-dependent pathways plays a central role in the leukemogenesis of this disease. She then describes the various treatment approaches for both juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in the US and Europe, emphasizing the differences between childhood and adult cases for the latter group of diseases. She also raises some controversial issues regarding treatment that will require well-controlled international clinical trials to address.",Journal Article,5864.0,115.0,Remarkable progress past decade

Improving the segmentation of therapy-induced leukoencephalopathy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a priori information and a gradient magnitude threshold.,Magnetic resonance in medicine,Magn Reson Med,2004-12-01,"Reliably quantifying therapy-induced leukoencephalopathy is a challenging task due to the similarity between its MR properties and those of normal tissues. Multispectral MR images were analyzed for 15 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three different analysis techniques were compared to examine improvements in the segmentation accuracy of leukoencephalopathy versus manual tracings by two experienced observers. The original technique used a white matter mask based on the segmentation of the first serial examination of each patient and no a priori information. The modified techniques combine spatially normalized a priori maps as input and a gradient magnitude threshold.

Bone marrow recurrence after initial intensive treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-01-01,"The authors studied the clinical outcome of 106 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed a bone marrow recurrence as the first adverse event after contemporary intensified therapy. Endpoints were the rates and lengths of second remission, the cumulative incidence of second hematologic recurrence, second event-free survival (EFS), and survival. Bone marrow recurrences were isolated in 79 patients, and combined with an extramedullary site in 27 patients. The median time to recurrence was 2.6 years (range, 0.3-11.6 years). Seventy-six patients (71.7%) attained a second remission (median length, 0.7 year; range, 0.03-13.3 years). The 5-year survival probability among all patients was 24.2% +/- 4.2% (standard error). On multivariate analysis, time to first disease recurrence and blast cell lineage were found to be independent predictors of a second EFS (P = 0.008 and P = 0.028, respectively). The 5-year EFS estimate in patients with an initial disease remission of >/= 36 months was 42.6% +/- 7.8% but was only 12.5% +/- 3.9% among children with a short duration of disease remission (< 36 months).

Activating mutations of the noonan syndrome-associated SHP2/PTPN11 gene in human solid tumors and adult acute myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-12-01,"The SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 (Shp2) is required for normal development and is an essential component of signaling pathways initiated by growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix. In many of these pathways, Shp2 acts upstream of Ras. About 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome have germ-line PTPN11 gain of function mutations. Associations between Noonan syndrome and an increased risk of some malignancies, notably leukemia and neuroblastoma, have been reported, and recent data indicate that somatic PTPN11 mutations occur in children with sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplasic syndrome, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia patients without PTPN11 mutations have either homozygotic NF-1 deletion or activating RAS mutations. Given the role of Shp2 in Ras activation and the frequent mutation of RAS in human tumors, these data raise the possibility that PTPN11 mutations play a broader role in cancer. We asked whether PTPN11 mutations occur in other malignancies in which activating RAS mutations occur at low but significant frequency. Sequencing of PTPN11 from 13 different human neoplasms including breast, lung, gastric, and neuroblastoma tumors and adult AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 11 missense mutations. Five are known mutations predicted to result in an activated form of Shp2, whereas six are new mutations. Biochemical analysis confirmed that several of the new mutations result in increased Shp2 activity. Our data demonstrate that mutations in PTPN11 occur at low frequency in several human cancers, especially neuroblastoma and AML, and suggest that Shp2 may be a novel target for antineoplastic therapy.",Journal Article,5529.0,336.0,SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 Shp2 required normal development essential component signaling pathways initiated growth factors cytokines extracellular matrix pathways Shp2 acts upstream Ras 50 patients Noonan syndrome germ-line PTPN11 gain function Associations Noonan syndrome increased risk malignancies notably leukemia neuroblastoma reported recent indicate somatic PTPN11 occur children sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplasic syndrome B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia AML Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia patients PTPN11 homozygotic NF-1 deletion activating RAS Given role Shp2 Ras activation frequent RAS human raise possibility PTPN11 play broader role asked PTPN11 occur malignancies activating RAS occur low significant frequency Sequencing PTPN11 13 different human neoplasms including breast lung gastric neuroblastoma adult AML acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed 11 missense known predicted activated form Shp2 new Biochemical confirmed new increased Shp2 activity demonstrate PTPN11 occur low frequency human especially neuroblastoma AML suggest Shp2 novel target antineoplastic therapy,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 16745, 1398, 1101, 178, 564, 2577, 8403, 15508, 16, 616, 9, 295, 193, 2, 16, 35, 1452, 1249, 1, 314, 460, 1917, 20, 129, 130, 1886, 2, 1976, 2248, 4, 445, 1, 46, 460, 15508, 4459, 3988, 1, 1102, 545, 212, 1, 7, 5, 26240, 681, 47, 2280, 328, 8403, 1803, 1, 343, 138, 685, 59, 26240, 681, 2, 35, 101, 43, 1, 476, 441, 2552, 2, 47, 85, 210, 2, 435, 74, 1008, 17, 1119, 8403, 138, 1271, 4, 541, 5, 1928, 7857, 5451, 43807, 681, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 2, 286, 2194, 329, 7857, 5451, 7, 187, 8403, 138, 47, 361, 43808, 1365, 14, 1528, 15, 1616, 1102, 138, 447, 3, 200, 1, 15508, 4, 1102, 363, 2, 3, 908, 258, 1, 1102, 4, 171, 57, 46, 74, 5008, 3, 2526, 17, 8403, 138, 1343, 8, 5410, 200, 4, 12, 21, 3732, 317, 8403, 138, 1271, 4, 127, 441, 4, 92, 1616, 1102, 138, 1271, 28, 154, 84, 93, 675, 615, 1, 8403, 29, 233, 338, 171, 1179, 141, 2, 57, 2, 780, 329, 2, 286, 1275, 553, 175, 4007, 138, 365, 32, 440, 138, 783, 6, 757, 4, 35, 735, 1297, 1, 15508, 547, 437, 32, 217, 138, 1487, 65, 557, 17, 392, 1, 3, 217, 138, 757, 4, 101, 15508, 128, 114, 74, 608, 17, 138, 4, 8403, 1271, 28, 154, 675, 4, 392, 171, 163, 1093, 2, 329, 2, 309, 17, 15508, 68, 40, 8, 229, 283, 9, 3940, 36]",1624.0,15604238,Activating noonan syndrome-associated SHP2/PTPN11 human solid adult acute myelogenous leukemia,25,0.0273224043715847

Folate pathway gene expression differs in subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and influences methotrexate pharmacodynamics.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2005-01-01,"The ability of leukemia cells to accumulate methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXPG) is an important determinant of the antileukemic effects of methotrexate (MTX). We measured in vivo MTXPG accumulation in leukemia cells from 101 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and established that B-lineage ALL with either TEL-AML1 or E2A-PBX1 gene fusion, or T-lineage ALL, accumulates significantly lower MTXPG compared with B-lineage ALL without these genetic abnormalities or compared with hyperdiploid (fewer than 50 chromosomes) ALL. To elucidate mechanisms underlying these differences in MTXPG accumulation, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze expression of 32 folate pathway genes in diagnostic leukemia cells from 197 children. This revealed ALL subtype-specific patterns of folate pathway gene expression that were significantly related to MTXPG accumulation. We found significantly lower expression of the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1, an MTX uptake transporter) in E2A-PBX1 ALL, significantly higher expression of breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2, an MTX efflux transporter) in TEL-AML1 ALL, and lower expression of FPGS (which catalyzes formation of MTXPG) in T-lineage ALL, consistent with lower MTXPG accumulation in these ALL subtypes.

Late mortality in survivors of autologous hematopoietic-cell transplantation: report from the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study.,Blood,Blood,2005-02-08,"We assessed late mortality in 854 individuals who had survived 2 or more years after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. Median age at HCT was 36.5 years, and median length of follow-up was 7.6 years. Overall survival was 68.8% +/- 1.8% at 10 years, and the cohort was at a 13-fold increased risk for late death (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 13.0) when compared with the general population. Mortality rates approached those of the general population after 10 years among patients at standard risk for relapse at HCT (SMR = 1.1) and in patients undergoing transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SMR = 0.9). Relapse of primary disease (56%) and subsequent malignancies (25%) were leading causes of late death. Relapse-related mortality was increased among patients with Hodgkin disease (HD; relative risk [RR] = 3.6), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 2.1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; RR = 6.5). Total body irradiation (RR = 0.6) provided a protective effect. Nonrelapse-related mortality was increased after carmustine (RR = 2.3) and with use of peripheral blood stem cells (RR = 2.4).

Pharmacogenetics of outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2005-02-15,"Acquired genetic characteristics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are used to individualize therapy, whereas germ line genetic characteristics generally are not. We determined whether ALL outcome was related to 16 genetic polymorphisms affecting the pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents. Of 246 children, 116 were treated on the lower-risk (LR) and 130 on the higher-risk (HR) arms of a St Jude protocol. Patients in the HR group with the glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1) non-null genotype had greater risk of hematologic relapse (P = .03), which was further increased by the thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) 3/3 genotype (P = .03). These genotypes remained predictive in multivariate analyses (P < .001 and .003, respectively). No genotypes were predictive in the LR arm. Expression of these 2 genes in ALL blasts was lower in those with low-activity genotypes. For central nervous system relapse, among the HR group, the vitamin D receptor start site (P = .02) and intron 8 genotypes (P = .04) predisposed, whereas for LR patients the TYMS 3/3 genotype predisposed (P = .04).

Failure to define window of time for autologous tumor vaccination in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2005-03-01,"We and others have shown that B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (ALL) stimulated with CD40 ligand become efficient antigen-presenting cells (APC) capable of expanding autologous, tumor-specific T cells from patients. Translation of these preclinical findings to a novel treatment strategy required four separate issues to be determined: (1) if a CD40-ALL vaccine could be generated for clinical use; (2) whether clinical translation could be achieved; (3) whether the vaccination was safe; and (4) whether a window of time could be identified that would optimize the efficacy of vaccination. Nine patients with relapsed/refractory ALL were enrolled in a phase I trial of vaccination with autologous CD40-ALL. Immunologic reconstitution was measured in a separate cohort of 23 patients with newly diagnosed ALL. We successfully prepared autologous vaccines for all nine patients in the phase I trial. CD40-ALL were potent APC, capable of stimulating allogeneic and peptide-specific T cells in vitro. Two patients were vaccinated without adverse events. Five patients died or progressed before vaccination, suggesting that rapid disease progression limits vaccination in patients with relapse disease, thus limiting clinical translation. We therefore sought to identify a window of time for vaccination during which this approach might be feasible. To achieve this end, we evaluated immunological reconstitution in newly diagnosed patients with ALL patients. Despite recovery of myelopoiesis, most patients had profound defects in T, B, and natural killer (NK) cell numbers that failed to recover at any point during therapy. Autologous tumor vaccination at a time of ALL relapse is not feasible. Alternative strategies for immunotherapy of ALL may require ex vivo generation of antigen specific T cells and adoptive therapy.",Clinical Trial,5439.0,27.0,shown B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia stimulated CD40 ligand efficient antigen-presenting APC capable expanding autologous tumor-specific patients Translation preclinical findings novel treatment strategy required separate issues determined 1 CD40-ALL vaccine generated clinical use 2 clinical translation achieved 3 vaccination safe 4 window time identified optimize efficacy vaccination patients relapsed/refractory enrolled phase trial vaccination autologous CD40-ALL Immunologic reconstitution measured separate cohort 23 patients newly diagnosed successfully prepared autologous vaccines patients phase trial CD40-ALL potent APC capable stimulating allogeneic peptide-specific vitro patients vaccinated adverse events patients died progressed vaccination suggesting rapid disease progression limits vaccination patients relapse disease limiting clinical translation sought identify window time vaccination approach feasible achieve end evaluated immunological reconstitution newly diagnosed patients patients Despite recovery myelopoiesis patients profound defects B natural killer NK numbers failed recover point therapy Autologous vaccination time relapse feasible Alternative strategies immunotherapy require ex vivo generation antigen specific adoptive therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 2, 1749, 47, 443, 17, 132, 31, 2765, 286, 1275, 37, 62, 2816, 5, 5040, 1232, 1417, 2547, 448, 1656, 37, 2528, 2787, 1, 4304, 1028, 30, 112, 102, 37, 29, 7, 2691, 1, 46, 693, 272, 6, 8, 229, 24, 692, 616, 294, 2282, 1553, 6, 40, 509, 14, 492, 8, 5040, 62, 1274, 359, 40, 1419, 9, 38, 119, 18, 317, 38, 2691, 359, 40, 513, 27, 317, 3, 1915, 10, 1165, 2, 39, 317, 8, 5421, 1, 98, 359, 40, 108, 17, 688, 2465, 3, 209, 1, 1915, 762, 7, 5, 591, 430, 62, 11, 346, 4, 8, 124, 70, 160, 1, 1915, 5, 1028, 5040, 62, 3042, 5616, 10, 644, 4, 8, 2282, 180, 1, 382, 7, 5, 732, 265, 62, 21, 1878, 4421, 1028, 1842, 9, 62, 762, 7, 4, 3, 124, 70, 160, 5040, 62, 11, 1157, 2528, 2787, 1, 2122, 1063, 2, 1389, 112, 102, 37, 4, 439, 100, 7, 11, 5130, 187, 290, 281, 365, 7, 1016, 15, 1839, 348, 1915, 802, 17, 1321, 34, 91, 3526, 1915, 4, 7, 5, 429, 34, 631, 817, 38, 2691, 21, 673, 990, 6, 255, 8, 5421, 1, 98, 9, 1915, 190, 92, 26, 353, 822, 40, 1313, 6, 1359, 26, 396, 21, 194, 5073, 5616, 4, 732, 265, 7, 5, 62, 7, 550, 1602, 1, 23233, 96, 7, 42, 4399, 2945, 4, 102, 132, 2, 1504, 3458, 1765, 31, 1870, 17, 1551, 6, 9966, 28, 500, 741, 190, 36, 1028, 30, 1915, 28, 8, 98, 1, 62, 429, 16, 44, 1313, 1091, 422, 9, 726, 1, 62, 68, 1353, 2581, 386, 914, 1, 448, 112, 102, 37, 2, 3159, 36]",1793.0,15730852,Failure define window time autologous vaccination patients newly diagnosed relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia,525,0.5737704918032787

Maternal diet and infant leukemia: the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor hypothesis: a report from the children's oncology group.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2005-03-01,"The MLL 11q23 translocation arises in utero and is present in 75% of infant leukemias. That MLL+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can arise following chemotherapy with DNA topoisomerase II (DNAt2) inhibitors suggests that these substances, which also occur naturally in foods, may contribute toward infant leukemia. We hypothesized that maternal consumption of dietary DNAt2 inhibitors during pregnancy would increase the risk of infant leukemia, particularly AML(MLL+). This Children's Oncology Group case-control study consisted of 240 incident cases of infant acute leukemia [AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] diagnosed during 1996 to 2002 and 255 random digit dialed controls. Maternal diet during pregnancy was determined through a food frequency questionnaire. An index of specific foods identified a priori to contain DNAt2 inhibitors as well as vegetables and fruits were created and analyzed using unconditional logistic regression. There was little evidence of an association between the specific DNAt2 index and leukemia overall and by subtype. An exception was AML(MLL+); odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing the second to fourth quartiles to the first were 1.9 (0.5-7.0), 2.1 (0.6-7.7), and 3.2 (0.9-11.9), respectively (P for trend = 0.10). For the vegetable and fruit index, there were significant or near-significant inverse linear trends for all leukemias combined, ALL(MLL+), and AML(MLL-).

We also identified a distinct phenotype of discordant resistance to asparaginase and vincristine and 139 genes whose expression was associated with this novel phenotype.

Chronic progressive cardiac dysfunction years after doxorubicin therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Cross-sectional studies show that cardiac abnormalities are common in long-term survivors of doxorubicin-treated childhood malignancies. Longitudinal data, however, are rare. Serial echocardiograms (N = 499) were obtained from 115 doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (median age at diagnosis, 4.8 years; median follow-up after completion of doxorubicin, 11.8 years). Results were expressed as z scores to indicate the number of standard deviations (SDs) above (+) or below (-) the normal predicted value. Median individual and cumulative doxorubicin doses were 30 mg/m2 per dose and 352 mg/m2, respectively. Left ventricular fractional shortening was significantly reduced after doxorubicin therapy, and the reduction was related to cumulative dose. z scores for fractional shortening transiently improved before falling to -2.76 more than 12 years after diagnosis. Reduced fractional shortening was related to impaired contractility and increasing afterload, consequences of a progressive reduction of ventricular mass, and wall thickness relative to body-surface area. Left ventricular contractility fell significantly over time and was depressed at last follow-up in patients receiving more than 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were below normal more than 9 years after diagnosis. Even patients receiving lower cumulative doxorubicin doses experienced reduced mass and dimension. Fractional shortening and dimension at the end of therapy predicted these parameters 11.8 years later. Cardiac abnormalities were persistent and progressive after doxorubicin therapy. Inadequate ventricular mass with chronic afterload excess was associated with progressive contractile deficit and possibly reduced cardiac output and restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Global gene expression as a function of germline genetic variation.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2005-04-27,"Common, functional, germline genetic polymorphisms have been associated with clinical cancer outcomes. Little attention has been paid to the potential phenotypic consequences of germline genetic variation on downstream genes. We determined the germline status of 16 well-characterized functional polymorphisms in 126 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed whether global gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts from the same patients differed by these germline polymorphic genotypes. Gene expression values were adjusted for ALL-subtype-specific patterns. Of the 16 loci, only the UGT1A1 promoter repeat polymorphism [A(TA)nTAA] (UGT1A1*28) and GSTM1 deletion were significant predictors of global gene expression in a supervised approach, which divided patients based on their germline genotypes [UGT1A1: 124 probe sets, false discovery rate (FDR)=13%, P< or =0.0031; GSTM1: 112 probe sets, FDR=42.5%, P< or =0.0084]. Genes whose expression distinguished the UGT1A1 (TA) 7/7 genotype from the other UGT1A1 genotypes included HDAC1, RELA and SLC2A1; those that distinguished the GSTM1 null genotype from non-null genotype included NBS1 and PRKR. In an unsupervised approach, the gene expression profiles using the entire array delineated two major clusters of patients. The only germline genotype frequency that differed between the two clusters was UGT1A1 (P=0.002; Fisher's exact test). Although their expression is limited to specific tissues, both GSTM1 and UGT1A1 are involved in the conjugation (and thus transport, excretion and lipophilicity) of a broad range of endobiotics and xenobiotics, which could plausibly have consequences for gene expression in different tissues.",Journal Article,5382.0,13.0,Common functional germline genetic polymorphisms associated clinical outcomes Little attention paid potential phenotypic consequences germline genetic variation downstream determined germline status 16 well-characterized functional polymorphisms 126 children newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia assessed global expression profiles diagnostic blasts patients differed germline polymorphic genotypes expression values adjusted ALL-subtype-specific patterns 16 loci UGT1A1 promoter repeat polymorphism TA nTAA UGT1A1*28 GSTM1 deletion significant predictors global expression supervised approach divided patients based germline genotypes UGT1A1 124 probe sets false discovery rate FDR =13 P =0.0031 GSTM1 112 probe sets FDR=42.5 P =0.0084 expression distinguished UGT1A1 TA 7/7 genotype UGT1A1 genotypes included HDAC1 RELA SLC2A1 distinguished GSTM1 null genotype non-null genotype included NBS1 PRKR unsupervised approach expression profiles entire array delineated major clusters patients germline genotype frequency differed clusters UGT1A1 P=0.002 Fisher 's exact test expression limited specific tissues GSTM1 UGT1A1 involved conjugation transport excretion lipophilicity broad range endobiotics xenobiotics plausibly consequences expression different tissues,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[186, 583, 1009, 336, 1203, 47, 85, 41, 5, 38, 12, 123, 1215, 2111, 71, 85, 8328, 6, 3, 174, 3290, 3255, 1, 1009, 336, 1380, 23, 1489, 214, 21, 509, 3, 1009, 156, 1, 245, 149, 765, 583, 1203, 4, 3927, 541, 5, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 62, 21, 275, 317, 1648, 145, 55, 1241, 1, 752, 62, 2438, 29, 3, 827, 7, 2512, 20, 46, 1009, 7087, 2071, 145, 55, 1030, 11, 586, 9, 62, 875, 112, 764, 1, 3, 245, 2012, 158, 3, 6192, 973, 2334, 1907, 8, 4330, 54764, 6192, 339, 2, 9410, 1528, 11, 93, 674, 1, 1648, 145, 55, 4, 8, 7762, 353, 92, 2176, 7, 90, 23, 136, 1009, 2071, 6192, 2834, 2888, 2270, 2133, 1574, 116, 5929, 233, 19, 15, 13, 20231, 9410, 3726, 2888, 2270, 5929, 595, 33, 19, 15, 13, 22283, 214, 1310, 55, 4735, 3, 6192, 4330, 67, 67, 1183, 29, 3, 127, 6192, 2071, 159, 14241, 8672, 2, 37900, 135, 17, 4735, 3, 9410, 3505, 1183, 29, 220, 3505, 1183, 159, 15519, 2, 54765, 4, 35, 6512, 353, 3, 145, 55, 1241, 75, 3, 1797, 1926, 5610, 100, 458, 3780, 1, 7, 3, 158, 1009, 1183, 675, 17, 2512, 59, 3, 100, 3780, 10, 6192, 19, 13, 1111, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 242, 136, 55, 16, 383, 6, 112, 742, 110, 9410, 2, 6192, 32, 646, 4, 3, 9877, 2, 631, 4294, 8294, 2, 26111, 1, 8, 2094, 184, 1, 54766, 2, 24725, 92, 359, 30731, 47, 3255, 9, 145, 55, 4, 338, 742]",1675.0,15857854,Global expression function germline genetic variation,0,0.0
Prevalence of leukoencephalopathy in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with high-dose methotrexate.,AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2005-05-01,"An effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), intravenous (IV) methotrexate (MTX) has a notable toxic effect on the CNS, with leukoencephalopathy (LE) being the most common form. The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative MR imaging to prospectively assess potential risk factors on the temporal evolution of LE in patients treated for ALL. We evaluated the longitudinal prevalence of LE in 45 children treated for ALL in a single institutional protocol including seven courses of IV MTX and no cranial irradiation. Differences in signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images between hyperintense regions and normal-appearing genu were used to quantitatively detect LE. Cox proportional regression was used to estimate the effect of covariates (e.g., sex, MTX dose, age at diagnosis) on the prevalence of LE. After influential factors were identified, a generalized linear model was determined to predict the probability of LE in new patients. The model was necessary to facilitate statistical testing between examinations. Increasing exposure, which corresponding to more courses and higher doses of IV MTX, influenced the prevalence of LE.

High-dose methotrexate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: where is the evidence for its continued use?,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,2005-05-01,"High-dose intravenous methotrexate is an important component of many effective chemotherapeutic regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its use has a strong pharmacologic rationale: to overcome mechanisms of resistance of the malignant cells and to achieve cytotoxic concentrations in sanctuary sites for lymphoblasts. Although therapeutic progress in ALL during the past 4 decades has been closely associated with more widespread use of intravenous methotrexate and in progressively larger doses, little data exist to clearly support the use of high-dose intravenous methotrexate over a regimen of prolonged administration of low-dose methotrexate. The implied superiority of intravenous methotrexate mainly stems from studies that used identical leucovorin rescue with low-dose methotrexate or from studies of upfront window therapy in untreated children with ALL in which single standard doses of oral methotrexate were compared with high-dose intravenous methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. The evidence favoring administration of intravenous methotrexate for children with ALL is critically reviewed.

Gene expression and thioguanine nucleotide disposition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia after in vivo mercaptopurine treatment.,Blood,Blood,2005-05-19,"To elucidate interpatient variability in thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) concentrations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, we determined the TGN concentrations in leukemic blasts from 82 children with newly diagnosed ALL after intravenous administration of mercaptopurine (MP). Patients treated with MP alone achieved higher TGN concentrations than those treated with the combination of methotrexate plus mercaptopurine (MTX + MP). Analysis of the expression of approximately 9600 genes in ALL cells obtained at diagnosis identified 60 gene probes significantly associated with TGN accumulation in patients treated with MP alone and 75 gene probes in patients treated with MTX + MP, with no overlap between the 2 sets of genes. Genes significantly associated with intracellular TGN accumulation after MP alone included those encoding MP metabolic enzymes and transporters (eg, SLC29A1). Inhibition of SLC29A1 by nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR) caused a 33% to 45% reduction of TGN in ALL cells in vitro (P < .006), consistent with the gene expression findings. Genes associated with TGN concentration after combination therapy included those involved in protein and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-biosynthesis.

The basis for residual protective immunity in lymphopenic patients is not known. We prospectively measured T-cell numbers, thymopoiesis, and T-cell memory in 73 children undergoing a 2-year chemotherapy regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and compared them to an age-matched cohort of 805 healthy children. Most patients had profound defects in CD4 and CD8 T-cell numbers at diagnosis that did not recover during the 2 years of therapy. Thymic output and the fraction of naive T cells were significantly lower than in healthy controls. However, the remaining T-cell compartment was enriched for antigen-experienced, memory T cells defined both by phenotype and by function. This relative sparing of T-cell memory may, in part, account for the maintenance of protective immunity in lymphopenic patients treated for ALL. Moreover, because the memory T-cell compartment is least affected by ALL and its treatment, strategies to induce immunity to pathogens or tumor antigens in cancer patients may be most successful if they seek to expand pre-existing memory T cells.",Clinical Trial,5353.0,29.0,Despite profound T-cell immunodeficiency patients treated chemotherapy succumb infection basis residual protective immunity lymphopenic patients known prospectively measured T-cell numbers thymopoiesis T-cell memory 73 children undergoing 2-year chemotherapy regimen acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared age-matched cohort 805 healthy children patients profound defects CD4 CD8 T-cell numbers diagnosis recover 2 years therapy Thymic output fraction naive significantly lower healthy controls remaining T-cell compartment enriched antigen-experienced memory defined phenotype function relative sparing T-cell memory account maintenance protective immunity lymphopenic patients treated memory T-cell compartment affected treatment strategies induce immunity pathogens antigens patients successful seek expand pre-existing memory,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 4399, 102, 31, 5323, 96, 7, 73, 5, 56, 1022, 44, 9025, 6, 930, 3, 877, 9, 753, 2864, 1604, 4, 16749, 7, 16, 44, 440, 21, 1143, 644, 102, 31, 1870, 28406, 2, 102, 31, 2407, 4, 803, 541, 479, 8, 18, 111, 56, 477, 9, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 72, 1370, 6, 35, 89, 655, 180, 1, 13628, 1331, 541, 96, 7, 42, 4399, 2945, 4, 1440, 2, 968, 102, 31, 1870, 28, 147, 17, 205, 44, 9966, 190, 3, 18, 60, 1, 36, 3572, 6911, 2, 3, 1509, 1, 2462, 102, 37, 11, 97, 280, 76, 4, 1331, 535, 137, 3, 1844, 102, 31, 3616, 10, 2220, 9, 448, 592, 2407, 102, 37, 395, 110, 20, 1005, 2, 20, 343, 26, 580, 1851, 1, 102, 31, 2407, 68, 4, 760, 1967, 9, 3, 1146, 1, 2864, 1604, 4, 16749, 7, 73, 9, 62, 1393, 408, 3, 2407, 102, 31, 3616, 16, 506, 1424, 20, 62, 2, 211, 24, 422, 6, 1290, 1604, 6, 9275, 15, 30, 1575, 4, 12, 7, 68, 40, 96, 1401, 492, 491, 6606, 6, 4082, 671, 1692, 2407, 102, 37]",1159.0,15920008,Antigen-specific T-cell memory preserved children treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

Periconceptional vitamin useand leukemia risk in children with Down syndrome: a Children's Oncology Group study.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-07-01,"Periconceptional vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects, and possibly may reduce the risk of certain childhood malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Because children with Down syndrome (DS) experience a 20-fold higher risk of leukemia than the general population, the authors evaluated whether periconceptional vitamin supplementation reduced the risk of leukemia in children with DS. From 1997 to 2002, 158 children ages birth-18 years with DS and acute leukemia (n = 61 children with acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and n = 97 children with ALL) were enrolled through the Children's Oncology Group in North America. Children with DS alone (n = 173) were identified through the cases' pediatric clinics and frequency matched to cases on age. Mothers of cases and controls completed a telephone interview that included questions regarding vitamin supplement use in the periconceptional period and after knowledge of pregnancy. A decreased risk of leukemia was observed with vitamin supplementation in the periconceptional period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.39-1.00). When stratified by leukemia type, the reduced risk was observed for ALL (OR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.89), but not for AML (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.48-1.76).

Targeting FLT3 in primary MLL-gene-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2005-06-14,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants is characterized by rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, drug resistance, and a poor treatment outcome. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve prognosis. Recently, we showed that FLT3 is highly expressed in MLL rearranged ALL (MLL). Here we demonstrate FLT3 expression in infants with MLL (n = 41) to be significantly higher compared to both infant (n = 8; P < .001) and noninfant patients with ALL (n = 23; P = .001) carrying germline MLL genes. Furthermore, leukemic cells from infants with MLL were significantly more sensitive to the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor PKC412 (N-benzoyl staurosporine) than noninfant ALL cells, and at least as sensitive as internal tandem duplication-positive (ITD+) AML cells. Surprisingly, activation loop mutations only occurred in about 3% (1 of 36) of the cases and no FLT3/ITDs were observed. However, measuring FLT3 phosphorylation in infants with MLL expressing varying levels of wild-type FLT3 revealed that high-level FLT3 expression is associated with ligand-independent FLT3 activation. This suggests that infant MLL cells displaying activated FLT3 as a result of overexpression can be targeted by FLT3 inhibitors such as PKC412. However, at concentrations of PKC412 minimally required to fully inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation, the cytotoxic effects were only fractional. Thus, PKC412-induced apoptosis in infant MLL cells is unlikely to be a consequence of FLT3 inhibition alone but may involve inhibition of multiple other kinases by this drug.",Journal Article,5334.0,117.0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia infants characterized rearrangements mixed lineage leukemia MLL drug resistance poor treatment outcome novel therapeutic strategies needed improve prognosis Recently showed FLT3 highly expressed MLL rearranged MLL demonstrate FLT3 expression infants MLL n 41 significantly higher compared infant n 8 P .001 noninfant patients n 23 P .001 carrying germline MLL Furthermore leukemic infants MLL significantly sensitive Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 N-benzoyl staurosporine noninfant sensitive internal tandem duplication-positive ITD+ AML Surprisingly activation loop occurred 3 1 36 cases FLT3/ITDs observed measuring FLT3 phosphorylation infants MLL expressing varying levels wild-type FLT3 revealed high-level FLT3 expression associated ligand-independent FLT3 activation suggests infant MLL displaying activated FLT3 overexpression targeted FLT3 inhibitors PKC412 concentrations PKC412 minimally required fully inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation cytotoxic effects fractional PKC412-induced apoptosis infant MLL unlikely consequence FLT3 inhibition involve inhibition multiple kinases drug,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 1275, 62, 4, 5585, 16, 765, 20, 2072, 1, 3, 1739, 2542, 3049, 145, 234, 251, 2, 8, 334, 24, 228, 673, 229, 189, 422, 32, 575, 6, 401, 356, 761, 21, 224, 17, 1224, 16, 561, 570, 4, 3049, 3201, 62, 3049, 467, 21, 608, 1224, 55, 4, 5585, 5, 3049, 78, 605, 6, 40, 97, 142, 72, 6, 110, 8027, 78, 66, 19, 144, 2, 33724, 7, 5, 62, 78, 382, 19, 144, 2934, 1009, 3049, 214, 798, 2015, 37, 29, 5585, 5, 3049, 11, 97, 80, 745, 6, 3, 5516, 733, 564, 216, 27, 1224, 230, 7154, 78, 33599, 16292, 76, 33724, 62, 37, 2, 28, 506, 22, 745, 22, 2329, 2905, 4616, 109, 2837, 329, 37, 5819, 363, 4432, 138, 158, 489, 4, 545, 27, 14, 1, 511, 1, 3, 140, 2, 77, 1224, 21984, 11, 164, 137, 2978, 1224, 982, 4, 5585, 5, 3049, 1046, 2990, 148, 1, 955, 267, 1224, 553, 17, 64, 301, 1224, 55, 16, 41, 5, 1232, 306, 1224, 363, 26, 844, 17, 8027, 3049, 37, 6609, 735, 1224, 22, 8, 757, 1, 851, 122, 40, 238, 20, 1224, 222, 225, 22, 7154, 137, 28, 1003, 1, 7154, 2144, 616, 6, 1910, 1433, 1224, 982, 3, 759, 176, 11, 158, 7528, 631, 7154, 277, 351, 4, 8027, 3049, 37, 16, 3568, 6, 40, 8, 4177, 1, 1224, 297, 279, 84, 68, 3882, 297, 1, 232, 127, 1549, 20, 26, 234]",1519.0,15956279,Targeting FLT3 primary MLL-gene-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia,41,0.04480874316939891

The authors investigated the effects of a newly designed Bcr-Abl inhibitor, AMN107, by comparing its in vitro inhibitory potency on p190 Bcr-Abl ALL cell lines with that of imatinib. In two Philadelphia (Ph)-positive ALL cell lines, AMN107 was found to be 30-40 times more potent than imatinib in inhibiting cellular proliferation. AMN107 was also more effective than imatinib in inhibiting phosphorylation of p190 Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in cell lines and primary ALL cells. The inhibition of cellular proliferation was associated with the induction of apoptosis in only one of the cell lines. No activity was observed in cell lines lacking the BCR-ABL genotype.

Recently, we and others identified a single recurrent somatic activating mutation (JAK2V617F) in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) tyrosine kinase in the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis. We used direct sequence analysis to determine if the JAK2V617F mutation was present in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)/atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia (aCML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), T-cell ALL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Analysis of 222 patients with AML identified JAK2V617F mutations in 4 patients with AML, 3 of whom had a preceding MPD. JAK2V617F mutations were identified in 9 (7.8%) of 116 CMML/a CML samples, and in 2 (4.2%) of 48 MDS samples. We did not identify the JAK2V617F disease allele in B-lineage ALL (n = 83), T-cell ALL (n = 93), or CLL (n = 45).

Induction therapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of more than 1500 patients from the international ALL trial: MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993.,Blood,Blood,2005-08-16,"The international acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) study was designed to prospectively define the optimal therapy for adults 60 years of age or younger with newly diagnosed ALL. All patients received identical induction therapy, and 91% achieved complete remission (CR). Patients 50 years of age or younger with a compatible sibling were assigned to undergo allogeneic transplantation; the others were randomly assigned to autologous transplantation or to consolidation/maintenance therapy for 2.5 years. Patients who did not achieve CR after induction had an overall survival rate of 5% compared with 45% for patients who achieved CR. Factors at diagnosis predictive of overall survival and disease-free survival were age (P = .001), white blood cell count less than 30 x 10(9)/L for B lineage or less than 100 x 10(9)/L for T lineage (P = .001) and immunophenotype, T lineage versus B lineage (P = .001). The data demonstrate that achieving CR with induction therapy is indispensable for long-term survival in adult patients with ALL. Furthermore, with a response rate greater than 90%, the induction regimen was highly efficacious as remission-inducing therapy. This large database has validated several previously identified independent prognostic factors in ALL, such as age, white blood cell count at presentation, cytogenetics, and immunophenotype.

Changes in bone mineral density in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2006-01-01,"There is little information about factors modulating bone mineral density (BMD) in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed data from 57 survivors (26 male, 52 Caucasian) who underwent two serial quantitative computed tomography (QCT) studies of BMD. Using multiple linear regression, we evaluated the association of BMD change with demographic variables, treatment history, hormone therapy, exercise, and tobacco and alcohol use. The median age was 3.4 years (range, 0.9-17.4 years) at diagnosis of ALL; the median age at the first QCT (Study I) was 15.0 years (range, 10.6-31.0 years) and at the second QCT (Study II) was 18.2 years (range, 14.2-35.3 years). Mean height increased 4.7 cm and mean weight increased 8.8 kg between Studies I and II. While the mean BMD increased 9.33 mg/cc (P = 0.003), the BMD Z-score increased only slightly (0.21 SD, P = 0.035). Cortical bone density increased significantly (approximately 25.3 mg/cc; P = 0.001), but the ratio of trabecular to cortical BMD decreased significantly (P = 0.045). Factors independently associated with unfavorable BMD changes included older age at diagnosis (P = 0.001), female sex (P = 0.018), and nutritional supplementation (0.032). Alcohol (P = 0.009) was an unfavorable factor in a univariable analysis. Bone mineral accretion during adolescence is attenuated in childhood ALL survivors by a comparative deficit in trabecular versus cortical bone deposition. BMD is influenced favorably by exercise in early adolescence and unfavorably by the use of nutritional supplements and alcohol. These results provide new information about behavioral factors that affect bone accrual in survivors of childhood ALL and warrant definitive evaluation in a larger cohort.",Journal Article,5133.0,66.0,little information factors modulating bone mineral density BMD survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia 57 survivors 26 male 52 Caucasian underwent serial quantitative computed tomography QCT studies BMD multiple linear regression evaluated association BMD change demographic variables treatment history hormone therapy exercise tobacco alcohol use median age 3.4 years range 0.9-17.4 years diagnosis median age QCT 15.0 years range 10.6-31.0 years second QCT II 18.2 years range 14.2-35.3 years Mean height increased 4.7 cm mean weight increased 8.8 Studies II mean BMD increased 9.33 mg/cc P 0.003 BMD Z-score increased slightly 0.21 SD P 0.035 Cortical bone density increased significantly approximately 25.3 mg/cc P 0.001 ratio trabecular cortical BMD decreased significantly P 0.045 Factors independently associated unfavorable BMD changes included older age diagnosis P 0.001 female sex P 0.018 nutritional supplementation 0.032 Alcohol P 0.009 unfavorable factor univariable Bone mineral accretion adolescence attenuated childhood survivors comparative deficit trabecular versus cortical bone deposition BMD influenced favorably exercise early adolescence unfavorably use nutritional supplements alcohol provide new information behavioral factors affect bone accrual survivors childhood warrant definitive evaluation larger cohort,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[125, 16, 1215, 487, 545, 130, 3712, 5033, 1263, 3503, 4, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 21, 311, 74, 29, 696, 332, 432, 1045, 653, 3229, 54, 208, 100, 2108, 1156, 1220, 872, 19031, 94, 1, 3503, 75, 232, 1646, 320, 21, 194, 3, 248, 1, 3503, 707, 5, 1540, 682, 24, 532, 785, 36, 2277, 2, 2607, 2, 2197, 119, 3, 52, 89, 10, 27, 39, 60, 184, 13, 83, 269, 39, 60, 28, 147, 1, 62, 3, 52, 89, 28, 3, 157, 19031, 45, 70, 10, 167, 13, 60, 184, 79, 49, 456, 13, 60, 2, 28, 3, 419, 19031, 45, 215, 10, 203, 18, 60, 184, 213, 18, 465, 27, 60, 313, 4594, 101, 39, 67, 494, 2, 313, 924, 101, 66, 66, 503, 59, 94, 70, 2, 215, 369, 3, 313, 3503, 101, 83, 466, 81, 1951, 19, 13, 1421, 3, 3503, 3905, 368, 101, 158, 3223, 13, 239, 1270, 19, 13, 4514, 4500, 1263, 101, 97, 705, 243, 27, 81, 1951, 19, 13, 144, 84, 3, 197, 1, 12853, 6, 4500, 3503, 340, 97, 19, 13, 4918, 130, 1042, 41, 5, 2483, 3503, 400, 159, 434, 89, 28, 147, 19, 13, 144, 1061, 1035, 19, 13, 4047, 2, 5082, 3890, 13, 4708, 2197, 19, 13, 2376, 10, 35, 2483, 161, 4, 8, 4084, 65, 5033, 44082, 190, 6964, 16, 2656, 4, 864, 62, 332, 20, 8, 2352, 6819, 4, 12853, 185, 4500, 6686, 3503, 16, 2574, 5001, 20, 2277, 4, 191, 6964, 2, 44083, 20, 3, 119, 1, 5082, 6600, 2, 2197, 46, 99, 377, 217, 487, 545, 4166, 130, 17, 1158, 2262, 4, 332, 1, 864, 62, 2, 2946, 1057, 451, 4, 8, 1077, 180]",1649.0,16106430,Changes bone mineral density survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,174,0.1901639344262295
Clinical characteristics and outcome of children with Down syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Children's Cancer Group study.,Blood,Blood,2005-08-18,"We assessed the outcome of children with Down syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving contemporary risk-based therapy by evaluating clinical and biologic features and outcome of children with ALL, with or without DS, enrolled in Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols between 1983 and 1995. Comparison of characteristics of children with ALL with (ALL-DS; n = 179) or without (ALL-NDS; n = 8268) DS showed no differences in initial white blood cell (WBC) count, central nervous system disease, and risk group. Children with ALL-DS did not present with unfavorable translocations and were older than 1 year of age at diagnosis with ALL.

FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations induce myeloproliferative or lymphoid disease in a transgenic mouse model.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-11-01,"Activating FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations have been identified in approximately 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and recently in a smaller subset of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To explore the in vivo consequences of an activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD), we created a transgenic mouse model in which FLT3-ITD was expressed under the control of the vav hematopoietic promoter. Five independent lines of vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed a myeloproliferative disease with high penetrance and a disease latency of 6-12 months. The phenotype was characterized by splenomegaly, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, and marked thrombocythemia, but without leukocytosis, polycythemia, or marrow fibrosis, displaying features reminiscent of the human disease essential thrombocythemia (ET). Clonal immature B- or T-lymphoid disease was observed in two additional founder mice, respectively, that could be secondarily transplanted to recipient mice that rapidly developed lymphoid disease. Treatment of these mice with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412, resulted in suppression of disease and a statistically significant prolongation of survival. These results demonstrate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inducing myeloproliferative as well as lymphoid disease, and indicate that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for lymphoid malignancies in humans that are associated with activating mutations in FLT3.",Journal Article,5194.0,46.0,Activating FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 FLT3 identified approximately 30 patients acute myelogenous leukemia AML recently smaller subset patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia explore vivo consequences activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication FLT3-ITD created transgenic mouse model FLT3-ITD expressed control vav hematopoietic promoter independent lines vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed myeloproliferative disease high penetrance disease latency 6-12 months phenotype characterized splenomegaly megakaryocytic hyperplasia marked thrombocythemia leukocytosis polycythemia marrow fibrosis displaying features reminiscent human disease essential thrombocythemia Clonal immature B- T-lymphoid disease observed additional founder mice respectively secondarily transplanted recipient mice rapidly developed lymphoid disease Treatment mice FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412 resulted suppression disease statistically significant prolongation survival demonstrate FLT3-ITD capable inducing myeloproliferative lymphoid disease indicate small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors effective treatment lymphoid malignancies humans associated activating FLT3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1616, 5516, 733, 564, 216, 27, 1224, 138, 47, 85, 108, 4, 705, 201, 1, 7, 5, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 761, 4, 8, 2170, 697, 1, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 6, 1645, 3, 4, 386, 3255, 1, 35, 1616, 1224, 2329, 2905, 4616, 258, 1224, 2837, 21, 2466, 8, 2862, 830, 202, 4, 92, 1224, 2837, 10, 570, 669, 3, 182, 1, 3, 37095, 1007, 973, 365, 306, 285, 1, 37095, 1224, 2837, 2862, 399, 276, 8, 34, 5, 64, 4792, 2, 8, 34, 5301, 1, 49, 133, 53, 3, 1005, 10, 765, 20, 6364, 14385, 3176, 2, 2003, 8962, 84, 187, 7463, 5755, 15, 581, 3000, 6609, 404, 17726, 1, 3, 171, 34, 1452, 8962, 2022, 1946, 5733, 132, 15, 102, 2303, 34, 10, 164, 4, 100, 402, 7243, 399, 106, 17, 359, 40, 12974, 4600, 6, 5783, 399, 17, 1755, 276, 2303, 34, 24, 1, 46, 399, 5, 3, 1224, 564, 216, 230, 7154, 627, 4, 1332, 1, 34, 2, 8, 712, 93, 4464, 1, 25, 46, 99, 608, 17, 1224, 2837, 16, 2787, 1, 1958, 22, 149, 22, 2303, 34, 2, 1008, 17, 302, 1354, 564, 216, 222, 68, 40, 35, 323, 24, 9, 2303, 441, 4, 3218, 17, 32, 41, 5, 1616, 138, 4, 1224]",1433.0,16116483,FLT3 internal tandem duplication induce myeloproliferative lymphoid disease transgenic mouse model,2,0.002185792349726776
Angiogenic factors may have a different prognostic role in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2005-08-25,"Angiogenesis plays an important role in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The prognostic significance of angiogenic factors in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains ambiguous. We therefore analyzed the impact of angiogenic factor levels on overall survival of newly diagnosed adult ALL patients. Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukin-1 receptor alpha (IL-1Ralpha), IL-6, IL-8, VEGF receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and thrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in plasma samples of 95 patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, higher levels of IL-1Ralpha, IL-8, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were predictive of poor survival. In contrast, higher levels of VEGF were predictive of longer survival, and higher levels of bFGF suggested a similar trend (P = .09). The multivariate model simultaneously included VEGF (relative risk [RR] for death, 8.01; P = .001 for levels less than or equal to 19.5 pg/mL), IL-1Ralpha (RR, 5.12; P = .007 for levels greater than 373 pg/mL), and VEGFR2 (RR, 4.01; P = .04 for levels greater than 8222 pg/mL) as independent factors for survival. Of interest is the association of high levels of VEGF with good prognosis and higher levels of VEGF receptors with poor outcome. These data reflect the complexity by which angiogenic factors may affect the clinical behavior of patients with ALL, and this complexity should be considered in any therapeutic strategy incorporating antiangiogenic agents.",Journal Article,5262.0,60.0,Angiogenesis plays important role solid hematologic malignancies prognostic significance angiogenic factors adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains ambiguous impact angiogenic factor levels overall survival newly diagnosed adult patients Plasma levels vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF interleukin-1 receptor alpha IL-1Ralpha IL-6 IL-8 VEGF receptors VEGFR1 VEGFR2 thrombopoietin TPO measured plasma 95 patients enzyme-linked immunosorbent ELISA univariate Cox proportional hazards model higher levels IL-1Ralpha IL-8 VEGFR1 VEGFR2 predictive poor survival contrast higher levels VEGF predictive longer survival higher levels bFGF suggested similar trend P .09 multivariate model simultaneously included VEGF relative risk RR death 8.01 P .001 levels equal 19.5 pg/mL IL-1Ralpha RR 5.12 P .007 levels greater 373 pg/mL VEGFR2 RR 4.01 P .04 levels greater 8222 pg/mL independent factors survival association high levels VEGF good prognosis higher levels VEGF receptors poor outcome reflect complexity angiogenic factors affect clinical behavior patients complexity considered therapeutic strategy incorporating antiangiogenic agents,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1056, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 537, 57, 2, 813, 441, 3, 177, 724, 1, 2068, 130, 4, 780, 286, 1275, 62, 469, 11286, 21, 673, 311, 3, 345, 1, 2068, 161, 148, 23, 63, 25, 1, 732, 265, 780, 62, 7, 554, 148, 1, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 2795, 3758, 129, 161, 7964, 1603, 14, 153, 950, 501, 38009, 501, 49, 501, 66, 618, 1186, 7952, 2, 4609, 2, 15494, 14110, 11, 644, 4, 554, 347, 1, 48, 7, 20, 1644, 1199, 5339, 719, 3664, 4, 8, 880, 418, 831, 1017, 202, 142, 148, 1, 501, 38009, 501, 66, 7952, 2, 4609, 11, 464, 1, 334, 25, 4, 748, 142, 148, 1, 618, 11, 464, 1, 589, 25, 2, 142, 148, 1, 7964, 1148, 8, 288, 853, 19, 1730, 3, 331, 202, 3074, 159, 618, 580, 43, 861, 9, 273, 66, 355, 19, 144, 9, 148, 299, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 326, 33, 3234, 542, 501, 38009, 861, 33, 133, 19, 1999, 9, 148, 378, 76, 9342, 3234, 542, 2, 4609, 861, 39, 355, 19, 755, 9, 148, 378, 76, 55032, 3234, 542, 22, 306, 130, 9, 25, 1, 1333, 16, 3, 248, 1, 64, 148, 1, 618, 5, 1178, 356, 2, 142, 148, 1, 618, 1186, 5, 334, 228, 46, 74, 2694, 3, 3082, 20, 92, 2068, 130, 68, 1158, 3, 38, 1710, 1, 7, 5, 62, 2, 26, 3082, 257, 40, 515, 4, 500, 189, 692, 2570, 2168, 183]",1488.0,16123221,Angiogenic factors different prognostic role adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia,1,0.001092896174863388

Of the B-lineage ALL cases, 37 were BCR/ABL+, 10 were ALL1/AF4+, 5 were E2A/PBX1+, and 43 carried no known molecular abnormality. ZAP-70 was highly expressed in T-ALL. A high ZAP-70 expression was also found in a proportion of B-lineage ALL, the highest levels being associated with the E2A/PBX1+ group and the lowest with ALL1/AF4+ cases (P < .001). A higher ZAP-70 expression was also observed in the pre-B group (P < .001). Remarkably, Syk expression was always preserved, suggesting that ZAP-70 expression is not substitutive of Syk. At the protein level, ZAP-70 was evaluated on 39 newly diagnosed ALL patients (25 adults, 14 children) and was detected in 23 cases (59%). ZAP-70 expression was consistently found in Ig mu+ cases. Evaluation of long-term outcome in cases without molecular abnormalities showed that the higher levels of ZAP-70 were coupled to a higher relapse rate.

Pharmacodynamic properties of methotrexate and Aminotrexate during weekly therapy.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2005-09-17,"4-Amino-pteroyl-glutamic acid (Aminotrexate; AMT) has several advantages over the related antifolate methotrexate (MTX), including greater potency, complete oral bioavailability, and greater accumulation by leukemic blasts in vitro. We compared the pharmacodynamic properties of AMT (given orally at 4 mg/m2 in two divided doses per week) and MTX (100 mg/m2 in four divided doses per week) among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We find AMT and MTX to have equivalent penetration into the bone marrow compartment of these patients, as indicated by the steady-state concentrations within mature red blood cells (RBCs). However, MTX concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid after oral dosage are significantly greater than AMT. To confirm these clinical observations, mice were treated four weekly injections of AMT or MTX, at a 1:20 dosage ratio, and tissue antifolate content was then determined over the subsequent 22 days. We confirm the selective exclusion of AMT from the CNS compartment, while showing equivalent accumulation of AMT and MTX in the RBCs, liver, spleen, kidneys and testes. Finally, we demonstrate that AMT, MTX, and their predominant polyglutamate species are equipotent inhibitors of their target intracellular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, emphasizing the critical nature of steady-state tissue accumulation in determining the relative cytotoxic potency of these two antifolates.",Comparative Study,5239.0,22.0,4-Amino-pteroyl-glutamic acid Aminotrexate AMT advantages related antifolate methotrexate MTX including greater potency complete oral bioavailability greater accumulation leukemic blasts vitro compared pharmacodynamic properties AMT given orally 4 mg/m2 divided doses week MTX 100 mg/m2 divided doses week children acute lymphoblastic leukemia AMT MTX equivalent penetration bone marrow compartment patients indicated steady-state concentrations mature red blood RBCs MTX concentrations cerebrospinal fluid oral dosage significantly greater AMT confirm clinical observations mice treated weekly injections AMT MTX 1:20 dosage ratio tissue antifolate content determined subsequent 22 days confirm selective exclusion AMT CNS compartment showing equivalent accumulation AMT MTX RBCs liver spleen kidneys testes Finally demonstrate AMT MTX predominant polyglutamate species equipotent inhibitors target intracellular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase emphasizing critical nature steady-state tissue accumulation determining relative cytotoxic potency antifolates,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[39, 3078, 43558, 12727, 971, 55083, 5383, 71, 392, 3126, 252, 3, 139, 12278, 2116, 3453, 141, 378, 3593, 236, 518, 5499, 2, 378, 1835, 20, 2015, 2438, 4, 439, 21, 72, 3, 2424, 1571, 1, 5383, 447, 1428, 28, 39, 81, 821, 4, 100, 2176, 415, 379, 647, 2, 3453, 394, 81, 821, 4, 294, 2176, 415, 379, 647, 107, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 21, 2469, 5383, 2, 3453, 6, 47, 2017, 4618, 237, 3, 581, 3616, 1, 46, 7, 22, 1103, 20, 3, 4152, 1309, 1003, 262, 2908, 3422, 315, 37, 15859, 137, 3453, 1003, 4, 3, 5156, 2357, 50, 518, 3323, 32, 97, 378, 76, 5383, 6, 1843, 46, 38, 2172, 399, 11, 73, 294, 709, 4344, 1, 5383, 15, 3453, 28, 8, 14, 179, 3323, 197, 2, 246, 12278, 2457, 10, 818, 509, 252, 3, 706, 350, 162, 21, 1843, 3, 1094, 4721, 1, 5383, 29, 3, 1025, 3616, 369, 2069, 2017, 1835, 1, 5383, 2, 3453, 4, 3, 15859, 4071, 7143, 2, 13100, 1368, 21, 608, 17, 5383, 3453, 2, 136, 2750, 22006, 2915, 32, 23478, 222, 1, 136, 283, 2087, 1644, 20298, 4027, 6826, 3, 740, 2202, 1, 4152, 1309, 246, 1835, 4, 2196, 3, 580, 759, 3593, 1, 46, 100, 14893]",1362.0,16170572,Pharmacodynamic properties methotrexate Aminotrexate weekly therapy,6,0.006557377049180328
Genomic assessment of pediatric acute leukemia.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"Advances in molecular genetics have revolutionized our understanding of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. Structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations are common, and their detection is vital for leukemia diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of response to therapy. Fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations are necessary but not sufficient for leukemogenesis, and there is intense research activity to elucidate the cooperating molecular abnormalities that may be suitable targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Candidate gene approaches have identified mutations in kinases and transcription factors in a proportion of patients, but more comprehensive genomic approaches are required. Gene expression profiling accurately classifies known subtypes of acute leukemia and has highlighted potentially leukemogenic abnormalities in gene expression. Newer techniques, such as single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to analyze changes in gene copy number and zygosity, cancer genome sequencing, and RNA interference, are promising tools to identify mutations, although at present, data from these approaches are limited. This review provides an overview of these techniques in clinical practice and as research tools to develop new therapeutic approaches in pediatric leukemia.",Journal Article,,8.0,Advances molecular genetics revolutionized understanding acute myeloid lymphoblastic leukemia Structural numerical chromosomal aberrations common detection vital leukemia diagnosis risk stratification monitoring response therapy Fusion resulting chromosomal translocations necessary sufficient leukemogenesis intense research activity elucidate cooperating molecular abnormalities suitable targets novel therapeutic approaches Candidate approaches identified kinases transcription factors proportion patients comprehensive genomic approaches required expression profiling accurately classifies known subtypes acute leukemia highlighted potentially leukemogenic abnormalities expression Newer techniques single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays changes copy number zygosity genome sequencing RNA interference promising tools identify present approaches limited review provides overview techniques clinical practice research tools develop new therapeutic approaches pediatric leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[954, 4, 219, 2894, 47, 5746, 114, 612, 1, 286, 533, 2, 1275, 3281, 2, 8736, 1860, 2152, 32, 186, 2, 136, 638, 16, 3511, 9, 147, 43, 1541, 2, 1315, 1, 51, 6, 36, 1212, 652, 1113, 29, 1860, 3262, 32, 1493, 84, 44, 1952, 9, 5661, 2, 125, 16, 3933, 389, 128, 6, 3061, 3, 11413, 219, 1171, 17, 68, 40, 2884, 637, 9, 229, 189, 611, 1609, 145, 611, 47, 108, 138, 4, 1549, 2, 866, 130, 4, 8, 920, 1, 7, 84, 80, 949, 572, 611, 32, 616, 145, 55, 1080, 2141, 15295, 440, 814, 1, 286, 2, 71, 3681, 751, 13519, 1171, 4, 145, 55, 2246, 1092, 225, 22, 226, 1579, 1907, 3923, 6, 1992, 400, 4, 145, 1337, 207, 2, 30849, 12, 898, 615, 2, 893, 3182, 32, 721, 1896, 6, 255, 138, 242, 28, 364, 74, 29, 46, 611, 32, 383, 26, 206, 777, 35, 2901, 1, 46, 1092, 4, 38, 758, 2, 22, 389, 1896, 6, 690, 217, 189, 611, 4, 815]",1259.0,16197717,Genomic assessment pediatric acute leukemia,168,0.18360655737704917

American journal of neuroradiology,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,2005-10-01,"Intravenous methotrexate (IV-MTX), an effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), has a significant toxic effect on the central nervous system, with leukoencephalopathy (LE) being the most common form. The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative MR imaging to prospectively assess the temporal evolution of LE extent and intensity. Forty-five children (low-risk, 10 mol/L/12F; mean age, 5.0 years at diagnosis; standard/high-risk, 11 mol/L/12F; mean age, 9.2 years at diagnosis) treated for ALL on a single institutional protocol were evaluated longitudinally to assess the extent of LE (proportion of white matter impacted) through tissue segmentation and the relative intensity of LE through relative elevations in T1 and T2 relaxation rates. One-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess differences in quantitative measures at 4 different points in therapy both within and between risk arms. The proportion of white matter affected in both patient groups increased significantly with additional courses of IV-MTX, whereas the intensity of LE also increased steadily; however, both the intensity and extent of LE declined significantly approximately 1.5 years after completion of IV-MTX. Increases in the T1 and T2 relaxation rates above normal-appearing white matter were significantly correlated with each other and were dependent on the proportion of white matter affected. Higher doses and more courses of IV-MTX were associated with increased intensity and extent of LE. There was a significant reduction in both the intensity and extent of LE after completion of therapy.

Oncol.,2005-11-01,"We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed treatment on contemporary clinical protocols between 1984 and 1999. Our goal was to use the information to further refine therapy and advance cure rates. Cumulative incidence functions of any post-treatment failure or any post-treatment relapse were estimated by the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice and compared with Gray's test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Of the 827 patients who completed all treatment while in initial complete remission, 134 patients subsequently had major adverse events, including 90 leukemic relapses, 40 second malignancies, and four deaths in remission. The cumulative incidence of any adverse event was 14.0% +/- 1.2% (SE) at 5 years and 16.9% +/- 1.4% at 10 years. The risk of any leukemic relapse was 10.0% +/- 1.1% at 5 years and 11.4% +/- 1.2% at 10 years. Male sex was the only independent predictor of relapse (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.74; P = .02).

Gene expression profiling identifies BAX-delta as a novel tumor antigen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2005-11-01,"The identification of new tumor-associated antigens (TAA) is critical for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly in diseases like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), where few target epitopes are known. To accelerate the identification of novel TAA in B-ALL, we used a combination of expression profiling and reverse immunology. We compared gene expression profiles of primary B-ALL cells with their normal counterparts, B-cell precursors. Genes differentially expressed by B-ALL cells included many previously identified as TAA in other malignancies. Within this set of overexpressed genes, we focused on those that may be functionally important to the cancer cell. The apoptosis-related molecule, BAX, was highly correlated with the ALL class distinction. Therefore, we evaluated BAX and its isoforms as potential TAA. Peptides from the isoform BAX-delta bound with high affinity to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-DR1. CD8+ CTLs specific for BAX-delta epitopes or their heteroclitic peptides could be expanded from normal donors.

Adaphostin-induced oxidative stress overcomes BCR/ABL mutation-dependent and -independent imatinib resistance.,Blood,Blood,2005-11-15,"The BCR/ABL kinase has been targeted for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by imatinib mesylate. While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often resistant. In particular, mutation of the T315 residue in the bcr/abl activation loop renders cells highly resistant to imatinib and to second-generation kinase inhibitors such as BMS-354825 or AMN107. Adaphostin is a tyrphostin that was originally intended to inhibit the BCR/ABL kinase by competing with its peptide substrates. Recent findings have in addition implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic mechanism of adaphostin. In view of this unique mode of action, we examined the effects of adaphostin on numerous imatinib-resistant leukemia models, including imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL cell lines, cells harboring point mutations in BCR/ABL, and specimens from imatinib-resistant CML patients, using assays for intracellular ROS, apoptosis, and clonogenicity. Every model of imatinib resistance examined remained fully sensitive to adaphostin-induced cell death.

Forty-six patients were enrolled in three strata: children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adults with ALL, and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aminopterin was given weekly, in two doses of 2 mg/m(2), 12 hours apart. Limited sampling pharmacokinetic analysis was done during the first week of therapy. Accumulation of [(3)H]aminopterin and [(3)H]methotrexate by leukemic blasts was studied in vitro. Six of 22 children with ALL (27%; 95% confidence interval, 8-47%) had clinically significant responses. None of those with AML and only two of 11 adults with ALL had responses meeting protocol definitions, although peripheral blast counts tended to decrease with therapy in all groups. Mucosal toxicity was minimal, even with limited use of leucovorin rescue. Complete bioavailability of aminopterin was confirmed, with a mean area under the curve of 0.52 +/- 0.03 micromol hour/L after oral dosing. No relationship between aminopterin pharmacokinetics and response was seen. In vitro, aminopterin showed more consistent metabolism by leukemic blasts to polyglutamates than methotrexate. Lineage-specific differences in the pattern of intracellular antifolylpolyglutamates were observed. Weekly oral aminopterin has significant activity among children with refractory ALL. With greater cellular accumulation and metabolism, more reliable bioavailability than methotrexate, and tolerable toxicity at this dose and schedule, aminopterin deserves further study as a potent alternative to methotrexate.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",5194.0,20.0,determine antileukemic activity weekly oral aminopterin patients refractory acute leukemia pharmacodynamic properties aminopterin contrast intracellular metabolism aminopterin methotrexate patients blasts vitro Forty-six patients enrolled strata children acute lymphoblastic leukemia adults patients acute myeloid leukemia AML Aminopterin given weekly doses 2 mg/m 2 12 hours apart Limited sampling pharmacokinetic week therapy Accumulation 3 H aminopterin 3 H methotrexate leukemic blasts studied vitro 22 children 27 95 confidence interval 8-47 clinically significant responses AML 11 adults responses meeting protocol definitions peripheral blast counts tended decrease therapy groups Mucosal toxicity minimal limited use leucovorin rescue Complete bioavailability aminopterin confirmed mean area curve 0.52 +/- 0.03 micromol hour/L oral dosing relationship aminopterin pharmacokinetics response seen vitro aminopterin showed consistent metabolism leukemic blasts polyglutamates methotrexate Lineage-specific differences pattern intracellular antifolylpolyglutamates observed Weekly oral aminopterin significant activity children refractory greater cellular accumulation metabolism reliable bioavailability methotrexate tolerable toxicity dose schedule aminopterin deserves potent alternative methotrexate,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 4512, 128, 1, 709, 518, 16421, 4, 7, 5, 430, 286, 6, 897, 3, 2424, 1571, 1, 16421, 2, 6, 748, 3, 2087, 1600, 1, 16421, 2, 2116, 20, 7, 2438, 4, 439, 1213, 437, 7, 11, 346, 4, 169, 5758, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 857, 5, 62, 2, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 16421, 10, 447, 709, 4, 100, 415, 1, 18, 81, 188, 18, 133, 1459, 5461, 383, 2874, 1456, 65, 10, 1822, 190, 3, 157, 647, 1, 36, 1835, 1, 27, 555, 16421, 2, 27, 555, 2116, 20, 2015, 2438, 10, 656, 4, 439, 437, 1, 350, 541, 5, 62, 428, 48, 307, 268, 66, 662, 42, 505, 93, 253, 1292, 1, 135, 5, 329, 2, 158, 100, 1, 175, 857, 5, 62, 42, 253, 2238, 1182, 3833, 242, 672, 3112, 1911, 3886, 6, 775, 5, 36, 4, 62, 271, 3068, 155, 10, 1048, 871, 5, 383, 119, 1, 3296, 4256, 236, 5499, 1, 16421, 10, 557, 5, 8, 313, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 1, 13, 653, 13, 680, 6297, 2583, 805, 50, 518, 1280, 77, 858, 59, 16421, 1159, 2, 51, 10, 527, 4, 439, 16421, 224, 80, 925, 1600, 20, 2015, 2438, 6, 16243, 76, 2116, 2542, 112, 362, 4, 3, 1177, 1, 2087, 55168, 11, 164, 709, 518, 16421, 71, 93, 128, 107, 541, 5, 430, 62, 5, 378, 763, 1835, 2, 1600, 80, 2450, 5499, 76, 2116, 2, 2668, 155, 28, 26, 61, 2, 1055, 16421, 8572, 195, 45, 22, 8, 1157, 1091, 6, 2116]",1723.0,16299240,Phase II trial oral aminopterin adults children refractory acute leukemia,10,0.01092896174863388
The treatment of adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2005-01-01,"Intensive chemotherapy regimens for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have greatly improved, and the majority of children with precursor B-cell ALL are able to achieve a complete remission (CR), with an induction rate approaching 98% and a 5-year estimated event-free survival rate (EFS) of approximately 80%. Although there have been dramatic improvements over the last several decades in both the EFS and overall survival (OS) rates in young children with ALL, the results in adult clinical trials have not kept pace. Current adult treatment regimens result in CR rates in the 80% range, with EFS at 5 years of only 30%-40%. Adolescents and young adults represent a minority of patients enrolled onto either adult or pediatric clinical trials.

Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of flavopiridol followed by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and mitoxantrone in relapsed and refractory adult acute leukemias.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-12-01,"The serine/threonine kinase inhibitor flavopiridol targets multiple cyclin-dependent kinases, induces checkpoint arrest, and interrupts transcriptional elongation. We designed a phase I clinical trial using a timed sequential therapy approach where flavopiridol was given for the dual purpose of initial cytoreduction and enhancing cell cycle progression of the remaining leukemia cell cohort followed by cycle-dependent drugs 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and mitoxantrone. Flavopiridol was given by 1-hour infusion daily for 3 days beginning day 1 followed by 2 g/m2/72 h ara-C beginning day 6 and 40 mg/m2 mitoxantrone beginning day 9. In vivo correlates included pharmacokinetics, modulation of blast cycle regulators, and serum and marrow supernatant vascular endothelial growth factor levels. Of 34 adults receiving induction therapy, 16 (47%) evinced direct leukemia cytotoxicity with > or =50% drop in peripheral blast counts and tumor lysis in 9 (26%). Four (12%) died during therapy (two fungal infections and two sudden death). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at 60 mg/m2/d with profound neutropenia >40 days duration, and maximal tolerated dose was 50 mg/m2/d. Overall response rate was 31% in 26 acute myelogenous leukemia and 12.5% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pharmacokinetics showed that a linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination provided the best fit of the observed concentration versus time data. Flavopiridol down-regulated one or more target proteins in marrow blasts in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor was detected in sera and marrow supernatant pretreatment, and sera obtained on day 3 inhibited bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation by a mean of 32% (range, 10-80%). Our data suggest that flavopiridol is cytotoxic to leukemic cells and, when followed by ara-C and mitoxantrone, exerts biological and clinical effects in patients with relapsed and refractory acute leukemias. These findings warrant continuing development of flavopiridol at 50 mg/m2/d x 3 days in combination with cytotoxic and biological agents for acute leukemias.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",5164.0,63.0,serine/threonine kinase inhibitor flavopiridol targets multiple cyclin-dependent kinases induces checkpoint arrest interrupts transcriptional elongation designed phase clinical trial timed sequential therapy approach flavopiridol given dual purpose initial cytoreduction enhancing cycle progression remaining leukemia cohort followed cycle-dependent drugs 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine ara-C mitoxantrone Flavopiridol given 1-hour infusion daily 3 days beginning day 1 followed 2 g/m2/72 h ara-C beginning day 6 40 mg/m2 mitoxantrone beginning day 9 vivo correlates included pharmacokinetics modulation blast cycle regulators serum marrow supernatant vascular endothelial growth factor levels 34 adults receiving induction therapy 16 47 evinced direct leukemia cytotoxicity =50 drop peripheral blast counts lysis 9 26 12 died therapy fungal infections sudden death Dose-limiting toxicity occurred 60 mg/m2/d profound neutropenia 40 days duration maximal tolerated dose 50 mg/m2/d Overall response rate 31 26 acute myelogenous leukemia 12.5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia Pharmacokinetics showed linear two-compartment model first-order elimination provided best fit observed concentration versus time Flavopiridol down-regulated target marrow blasts vivo Vascular endothelial growth factor detected sera marrow supernatant pretreatment sera obtained day 3 inhibited bovine aortic endothelial proliferation mean 32 range 10-80 suggest flavopiridol cytotoxic leukemic followed ara-C mitoxantrone exerts clinical effects patients relapsed refractory acute leukemias findings warrant continuing development flavopiridol 50 mg/m2/d x 3 days combination cytotoxic agents acute leukemias,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3734, 5131, 216, 230, 3030, 637, 232, 1226, 470, 1549, 1516, 986, 1854, 2, 30880, 1431, 12359, 21, 1114, 8, 124, 70, 38, 160, 75, 8, 12200, 1787, 36, 353, 1257, 3030, 10, 447, 9, 3, 1828, 743, 1, 388, 2844, 2, 2430, 31, 417, 91, 1, 3, 1844, 31, 180, 370, 20, 417, 470, 600, 14, 1090, 427, 21019, 3899, 256, 2, 4419, 3030, 10, 447, 20, 14, 2583, 904, 391, 9, 27, 162, 2948, 218, 14, 370, 20, 18, 499, 821, 720, 555, 3899, 256, 2948, 218, 49, 2, 327, 81, 821, 4419, 2948, 218, 83, 4, 386, 1871, 159, 1159, 2356, 1, 3112, 417, 3196, 2, 524, 2, 581, 14542, 756, 845, 129, 161, 148, 1, 562, 857, 357, 504, 36, 245, 662, 44174, 1196, 1408, 5, 15, 212, 7215, 4, 672, 3112, 1911, 2, 30, 4783, 4, 83, 432, 294, 133, 1016, 190, 36, 100, 7800, 1875, 2, 100, 10643, 273, 61, 817, 155, 489, 28, 335, 81, 821, 427, 5, 4399, 778, 327, 162, 654, 2, 2725, 421, 61, 10, 212, 81, 821, 427, 63, 51, 116, 10, 456, 4, 432, 286, 2194, 2, 133, 33, 4, 286, 1275, 1159, 224, 17, 8, 1646, 100, 3616, 202, 5, 157, 1732, 3730, 1052, 3, 824, 2975, 1, 3, 164, 1227, 185, 98, 74, 3030, 1328, 1065, 104, 15, 80, 283, 652, 4, 581, 2438, 4, 386, 756, 845, 129, 161, 10, 530, 4, 4210, 2, 581, 14542, 1194, 2, 4210, 683, 23, 218, 27, 879, 14218, 3938, 845, 31, 457, 20, 8, 313, 1, 531, 184, 79, 493, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3030, 16, 759, 6, 2015, 37, 2, 198, 370, 20, 3899, 256, 2, 4419, 5685, 1037, 2, 38, 176, 4, 7, 5, 591, 2, 430, 286, 2792, 46, 272, 2946, 4346, 193, 1, 3030, 28, 212, 81, 821, 427, 1006, 27, 162, 4, 150, 5, 759, 2, 1037, 183, 9, 286, 2792]",2025.0,16322302,Phase pharmacokinetic flavopiridol followed 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine mitoxantrone relapsed refractory adult acute leukemias,5,0.00546448087431694
Favorable outcome for infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2005-12-01,"Infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a poor prognosis when treated with standard chemotherapy. A subset of these infants, particularly those with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangements, has a high likelihood of relapse. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed early in first remission may improve outcome. We present the results of 16 patients with infant ALL who were treated with HSCT in first remission. Six patients were < or =6 months of age at diagnosis, 11 had an initial white blood cell count of >50000/microL, and all patients with determinable cytogenetics had a high-risk karyotype [t(4:11) abnormality or other MLL rearrangement]. All patients received 150 cGy of total body irradiation for 8 doses (1200 cGy). Fifteen of 16 patients received etoposide at 1000 mg/m(2) as a continuous infusion over 24 hours and cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/d for 3 days. Eight patients received HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling, and 8, from unrelated cord blood. Twelve (75%) patients remain long-term survivors (median follow-up, 4.7 years). Two patients, 1 of whom had minimal residual disease at HSCT, died after relapse following HSCT. Two patients died of transplant-related causes. The HSCT was well tolerated; 15 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 16 days. Acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were minimal in these patients. These results support the use of HSCT in the treatment of infant ALL, especially when used as consolidation in first remission. The risk of relapse seems to be decreased with this approach.

Differentiation of naive cord-blood T cells into CD19-specific cytolytic effectors for posttransplantation adoptive immunotherapy.,Blood,Blood,2005-12-13,"Disease relapse is a barrier to achieving therapeutic success after unrelated umbilical cord-blood transplantation (UCBT) for B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). While adoptive transfer of donor-derived tumor-specific T cells is a conceptually attractive approach to eliminating residual disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, adoptive immunotherapy after UCBT is constrained by the difficulty of generating antigen-specific T cells from functionally naive umbilical cord-blood (UCB)-derived T cells. Therefore, to generate T cells that recognize B-ALL, we have developed a chimeric immunoreceptor to redirect the specificity of T cells for CD19, a B-lineage antigen, and expressed this transgene in UCB-derived T cells. An ex vivo process, which is compliant with current good manufacturing practice for T-cell trials, has been developed to genetically modify and numerically expand UCB-derived T cells into CD19-specific effector cells.

Smaller white-matter volumes are associated with larger deficits in attention and learning among long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-02-01,"The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have deficits in neurocognitive performance, and smaller white-matter volumes are associated with these deficits. The patients studied included 112 ALL survivors (84 patients who had received chemotherapy only, 28 patients who had received chemotherapy and irradiation; 63 males, 49 females; mean age +/- standard deviation, 4.1 yrs +/- 2.6 yrs at diagnosis; mean +/- standard deviation yrs since diagnosis, 6.0 +/- 3.5 yrs), and 33 healthy siblings who participated as a control group. Neurocognitive tests of attention, intelligence, and academic achievement were performed; and magnetic resonance images were obtained and subsequently were segmented to yield tissue volume measurements. Comparisons of neurocognitive measures and tissue volumes between groups were performed, and the correlations between volumes and neurocognitive performance measures were assessed. Most performance measures demonstrated statistically significant differences from the normative test scores, but only attention measures exceeded 1.0 standard deviation from normal. Patients who had received chemotherapy alone had significantly larger volumes of white matter than patients who had received treatment that also included cranial irradiation, but their volumes remained significantly smaller than the volumes in the control group. Smaller white-matter volumes were associated significantly with larger deficits in attention, intelligence, and academic achievement. Survivors of childhood ALL had significant deficits in attention and smaller white-matter volumes that were associated directly with impaired neurocognitive performance.

Children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated on DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01. Patients were risk stratified primarily by current National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Rome risk criteria. With a median follow-up of 5.2 years, the 5-year event-free survival for TEL/AML1-positive patients was 89% compared with 80% for TEL/AML1-negative B-precursor patients (P = .05). The 5-year overall survival rate was 97% among TEL/AML-positive patients compared with 89% among TEL/AML1-negative patients (P = .03). However, in a multivariable analysis, risk group (age and leukocyte count at diagnosis) and asparaginase treatment group, but not TEL/AML1 status, were found to be independent predictors of outcome. We conclude that TEL/AML1-positive patients have excellent outcomes, confirming our previous findings.

We hypothesized that, in patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), cells with this phenotype detected early in treatment should be leukemic rather than normal. We therefore developed a simple and inexpensive flow cytometric assay for such cells and prospectively applied it to bone marrow samples collected on day 19 from 380 children with B-lineage ALL. In 211 patients (55.5%), these cells represented 0.01% or more of the mononuclear cells; results correlated remarkably well with those of more complex flow cytometric and molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluations. Among 84 uniformly treated children, the 10-year incidence of relapse or remission failure was 28.8% +/- 7.1% (SE) for the 42 patients with 0.01% or more leukemic cells on day 19 detected by the simplified assay versus 4.8% +/- 3.3% for the 42 patients with lower levels (P = .003). These assay results were the strongest predictor of outcome, even after adjustment for competing clinicobiologic variables. Thus, this new assay would enable most treatment centers to identify a high proportion of children with ALL who have an excellent early treatment response and a high likelihood of cure.",Evaluation Study,5061.0,97.0,Bone marrow normal lymphoid progenitors CD19+ CD10+ and/or CD34+ exquisitely sensitive corticosteroids antileukemic drugs hypothesized patients B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia phenotype detected early treatment leukemic normal developed simple inexpensive flow cytometric prospectively applied bone marrow collected day 19 380 children B-lineage 211 patients 55.5 represented 0.01 mononuclear correlated remarkably complex flow cytometric molecular minimal residual disease MRD evaluations 84 uniformly treated children 10-year incidence relapse remission failure 28.8 +/- 7.1 SE 42 patients 0.01 leukemic day 19 detected simplified versus 4.8 +/- 3.3 42 patients lower levels P .003 strongest predictor outcome adjustment competing clinicobiologic variables new enable treatment centers identify high proportion children excellent early treatment response high likelihood cure,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[581, 295, 2303, 4321, 3158, 6289, 2, 15, 2215, 32, 11936, 745, 6, 3876, 2, 127, 4512, 600, 21, 1237, 17, 4, 7, 5, 132, 2542, 286, 1275, 62, 37, 5, 26, 1005, 530, 191, 4, 24, 257, 40, 2015, 1832, 76, 295, 21, 673, 276, 8, 2763, 2, 8168, 1412, 6226, 719, 9, 225, 37, 2, 1143, 1498, 192, 6, 581, 347, 786, 23, 218, 326, 29, 8389, 541, 5, 132, 2542, 62, 4, 5905, 7, 614, 33, 46, 37, 3324, 13, 355, 15, 80, 1, 3, 3041, 37, 99, 438, 4856, 149, 5, 135, 1, 80, 840, 1412, 6226, 2, 219, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 3816, 107, 874, 4254, 73, 541, 3, 79, 111, 287, 1, 429, 15, 734, 496, 10, 339, 66, 67, 14, 3428, 9, 3, 595, 7, 5, 13, 355, 15, 80, 2015, 37, 23, 218, 326, 530, 20, 3, 8087, 719, 185, 39, 66, 27, 27, 9, 3, 595, 7, 5, 280, 148, 19, 1421, 46, 719, 99, 11, 3, 3311, 980, 1, 228, 871, 50, 1852, 9, 2573, 55347, 682, 631, 26, 217, 719, 688, 3047, 96, 24, 1168, 6, 255, 8, 64, 920, 1, 541, 5, 62, 54, 47, 35, 1503, 191, 24, 51, 2, 8, 64, 1420, 1, 1722]",1278.0,16537802,simplified flow cytometric identifies children acute lymphoblastic leukemia superior clinical outcome,0,0.0

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2006-04-01,"We compared the outcomes of 298 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission (CR1 or CR2) receiving HLA-matched sibling allografts after cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Cy-TBI) conditioning with 204 patients receiving etoposide and TBI. Consequently, 4 groups were compared: Cy-TBI <13 Gy (n = 217), Cy-TBI > or =13 Gy (n = 81), etoposide-TBI <13 Gy (n = 53), and etoposide-TBI > or =13 Gy (n = 151). Analyses of relapse, leukemia-free survival (LFS), and survival were performed separately for CR1 and CR2 transplantations. Transplant-related mortality did not differ by conditioning regimen. In CR1, there were also no significant differences in relapse, LFS, or survival by conditioning regimen. In CR2, these outcomes differed among conditioning groups. In comparison with Cy-TBI <13 Gy, the risks of relapse, treatment failure (inverse of LFS), and mortality tended to be lower with etoposide (regardless of TBI dose) or with TBI doses > or =13 Gy. For both CR1 and CR2 transplantations, causes of death were similar among the groups; disease recurrence accounted for 47% of deaths.

Richter's transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2006-04-01,"Richter's syndrome (RS) is characterized by the development of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. At The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center the incidence of RS is 3.9%. The large cells of RS may arise through transformation of the original CLL clone or represent a new neoplasm. RS may be triggered by viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Trisomy 12 and chromosome 11 abnormalities, as well as multiple genetic defects, have been described in patients with RS. These abnormalities may cause CLL cells to proliferate and, by facilitating the acquisition of new genetic abnormalities, to transform into RS cells. The therapeutic strategies for RS typically include therapies developed for NHL or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The reported response rates with these therapies are 5% to 43%, and the median survival duration ranges from 5 to 8 months.

Genes contributing to minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: prognostic significance of CASP8AP2.,Blood,Blood,2006-04-20,"In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), early response to treatment is a powerful prognostic indicator. To identify genes associated with this response, we analyzed gene expression of diagnostic lymphoblasts from 189 children with ALL and compared the findings with minimal residual disease (MRD) levels on days 19 and 46 of remission induction treatment. After excluding genes associated with genetic subgroups, we identified 17 genes that were significantly associated with MRD. The caspase 8-associated protein 2 (CASP8AP2) gene was studied further because of its reported role in apoptosis and glucocorticoid signaling. In a separate cohort of 99 patients not included in the comparison of gene expression profiles and MRD, low levels of CASP8AP2 expression predicted a lower event-free survival (P = .02) and a higher rate of leukemia relapse (P = .01) and were an independent predictor of outcome. High levels of CASP8AP2 expression were associated with a greater propensity of leukemic lymphoblasts to undergo apoptosis. We conclude that measurement of CASP8AP2 expression at diagnosis offers a means to identify patients whose leukemic cells are highly susceptible to chemotherapy. Therefore, this gene is a strong candidate for inclusion in gene expression arrays specifically designed for leukemia diagnosis.",Journal Article,5024.0,69.0,childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia early response treatment powerful prognostic indicator identify associated response expression diagnostic lymphoblasts 189 children compared findings minimal residual disease MRD levels days 19 46 remission induction treatment excluding associated genetic subgroups identified 17 significantly associated MRD caspase 8-associated 2 CASP8AP2 studied reported role apoptosis glucocorticoid signaling separate cohort 99 patients included comparison expression profiles MRD low levels CASP8AP2 expression predicted lower event-free survival P .02 higher rate leukemia relapse P .01 independent predictor outcome High levels CASP8AP2 expression associated greater propensity leukemic lymphoblasts undergo apoptosis conclude measurement CASP8AP2 expression diagnosis offers means identify patients leukemic highly susceptible chemotherapy strong candidate inclusion expression arrays specifically designed leukemia diagnosis,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 191, 51, 6, 24, 16, 8, 3757, 177, 3287, 6, 255, 214, 41, 5, 26, 51, 21, 311, 145, 55, 1, 752, 10521, 29, 5899, 541, 5, 62, 2, 72, 3, 272, 5, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 148, 23, 162, 326, 2, 641, 1, 734, 504, 24, 50, 3207, 214, 41, 5, 336, 1453, 21, 108, 269, 214, 17, 11, 97, 41, 5, 2029, 3, 1469, 66, 41, 178, 18, 34072, 145, 10, 656, 195, 408, 1, 211, 210, 200, 4, 351, 2, 5399, 314, 4, 8, 2282, 180, 1, 1058, 7, 44, 159, 4, 3, 1155, 1, 145, 55, 1241, 2, 2029, 154, 148, 1, 34072, 55, 783, 8, 280, 774, 115, 25, 19, 588, 2, 8, 142, 116, 1, 429, 19, 355, 2, 11, 35, 306, 980, 1, 228, 64, 148, 1, 34072, 55, 11, 41, 5, 8, 378, 1925, 1, 2015, 10521, 6, 1251, 351, 21, 2060, 17, 2204, 1, 34072, 55, 28, 147, 2339, 8, 2263, 6, 255, 7, 1310, 2015, 37, 32, 561, 4012, 6, 56, 673, 26, 145, 16, 8, 1082, 1609, 9, 1680, 4, 145, 55, 3923, 1225, 1114, 9, 147]",1273.0,16627760,contributing minimal residual disease childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia prognostic significance CASP8AP2,1,0.001092896174863388
Leukemia-stimulated bone marrow endothelium promotes leukemia cell survival.,Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2006-05-01,"Extensive endothelial cell proliferation and marked neovascularization are the most pronounced microenvironmental changes consistently observed in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is not known whether ALL cells induce this phenotype and whether they receive critical signals from the tumor-associated BM endothelium. Here, we show that leukemia cells actively stimulate BM endothelium, promote de novo angiogenesis, and induce neovascularization in the leukemic BM. Soluble factors, present in the leukemic BM microenvironment, promote the proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of BM endothelial cells, which are critical processes in tumor angiogenesis. We also show in vitro that leukemia cells display directional motion towards assembled BM endothelium and following adherence exhibit cell polarization, pseudopodia, and ultrastructural features that suggest the existence of leukemia-endothelium cross-talk. Finally, we show that BM endothelium promotes leukemia cell survival through a mechanism mediated through the anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2. These studies indicate that ALL cells actively recruit BM endothelium and mediate the leukemia-associated neovascularization observed in ALL. Therefore, disruption of interactions between leukemia cells and BM endothelium may constitute a valid therapeutic strategy.",Journal Article,5013.0,37.0,Extensive endothelial proliferation marked neovascularization pronounced microenvironmental changes consistently observed bone marrow BM patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia known induce phenotype receive critical signals tumor-associated BM endothelium leukemia actively stimulate BM endothelium promote novo angiogenesis induce neovascularization leukemic BM Soluble factors present leukemic BM microenvironment promote proliferation migration morphogenesis BM endothelial critical processes angiogenesis vitro leukemia display directional motion assembled BM endothelium following adherence exhibit polarization pseudopodia ultrastructural features suggest existence leukemia-endothelium cross-talk Finally BM endothelium promotes leukemia survival mechanism mediated anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2 studies indicate actively recruit BM endothelium mediate leukemia-associated neovascularization observed disruption interactions leukemia BM endothelium constitute valid therapeutic strategy,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1344, 845, 31, 457, 2, 2003, 10551, 32, 3, 96, 3517, 9300, 400, 2433, 164, 4, 3, 581, 1246, 1, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 192, 16, 44, 440, 317, 62, 37, 1290, 26, 1005, 2, 317, 491, 560, 740, 2312, 29, 3, 30, 41, 1246, 5300, 467, 21, 514, 17, 37, 4489, 4223, 1246, 5300, 1617, 1566, 2018, 1056, 2, 1290, 10551, 4, 3, 2015, 1246, 2968, 130, 364, 4, 3, 2015, 1246, 995, 1617, 3, 457, 1381, 2, 13281, 1, 1246, 845, 37, 92, 32, 740, 1849, 4, 30, 1056, 21, 120, 514, 4, 439, 17, 37, 3640, 15325, 2967, 3113, 6154, 1246, 5300, 2, 366, 2149, 2239, 31, 9207, 44319, 2, 13755, 404, 17, 309, 3, 5335, 1, 2647, 5300, 1383, 6522, 1368, 21, 514, 17, 1246, 5300, 2148, 31, 25, 298, 8, 670, 517, 298, 3, 312, 1631, 1354, 1044, 18, 46, 94, 1008, 17, 62, 37, 4489, 8973, 1246, 5300, 2, 3367, 3, 2647, 41, 10551, 164, 4, 62, 673, 3220, 1, 1286, 59, 37, 2, 1246, 5300, 68, 4999, 8, 4406, 189, 692]",1296.0,16647567,Leukemia-stimulated bone marrow endothelium promotes leukemia survival,0,0.0

We observed a consistently higher (2.8-fold) expression of OPAL1 in TEL-AML1-positive ALL compared with TEL-AML1-negative ALL in both cohorts, but higher OPAL1 expression was not consistently associated with other favorable prognostic indicators such as age and white blood cell count, or ALL genetic subtype. Lower OPAL1 expression was also not associated with increased in vitro drug resistance. Multivariate analyses including known risk factors showed that OPAL1 expression was not independently related to prognosis in either the COALL or St Jude cohorts.

Positive associations were found between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and maternal exposure to professional pest exterminations (odds ratio = 2.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 4.49), to any pesticide (odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 4.39), and to any chemical (odds ratio = 2.72, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 6.35). Most of the associations with acute myeloid leukemia were nonsignificant, and odds ratios were generally near or below 1.0.

Dasatinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2006-06-01,"The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily. A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting. Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib.

Med.,2006-06-01,"Resistance to imatinib mesylate can occur in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Preclinical in vitro studies have shown that nilotinib (AMN107), a new BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is more potent than imatinib against CML cells by a factor of 20 to 50. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, we assigned 119 patients with imatinib-resistant CML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to receive nilotinib orally at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg once daily and at 400 mg and 600 mg twice daily. Common adverse events were myelosuppression, transient indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and rashes. Of 33 patients with the blastic phase of disease, 13 had a hematologic response and 9 had a cytogenetic response; of 46 patients with the accelerated phase, 33 had a hematologic response and 22 had a cytogenetic response; 11 of 12 patients with the chronic phase had a complete hematologic remission.

Computer-aided detection of therapy-induced leukoencephalopathy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated with intravenous high-dose methotrexate.,Magnetic resonance imaging,Magn Reson Imaging,2006-04-27,"The purpose of this study was to use objective quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) tool to differentiate white matter (WM) hyperintensities into either leukoencephalopathy (LE) induced by chemotherapy or normal maturational processes in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia without irradiation. A combined MRI set consisting of T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton-density-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and WM, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid proportional volume maps from a spatially normalized atlas were analyzed with a neural network segmentation based on a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM). Segmented maps were manually classified to identify the most hyperintense WM region and the normal-appearing genu region. Signal intensity differences normalized to the genu within each examination were generated for four time points in 228 children. A second Kohonen SOM was trained on the first examination data and divided the WM into normal-appearing or LE groups. Reviewing labels from the CAD tool revealed a consistency measure of 89.8% (167 of 186) within patients. The overall agreement between the CAD tool and the consensus reading of two trained observers was 84.1% (535 of 636), with 84.2% (170 of 202) agreement in the training set and 84.1% (365 of 434) agreement in the testing set.

Epigenetic regulation of human gamma-glutamyl hydrolase activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2006-06-06,"Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) catalyzes degradation of the active polyglutamates of natural folates and the antifolate methotrexate (MTX). We found that GGH activity is directly related to GGH messenger RNA expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of patients with a wild-type germline GGH genotype. We identified two CpG islands (CpG1 and CpG2) in the region extending from the GGH promoter through the first exon and into intron 1 and showed that methylation of both CpG islands in the GGH promoter (seen in leukemia cells from approximately 15% of patients with nonhyperdiploid B-lineage ALL) is associated with significantly reduced GGH mRNA expression and catalytic activity and with significantly higher accumulation of MTX polyglutamates (MTXPG(4-7)) in ALL cells. Furthermore, methylation of CpG1 was leukemia-cell specific and had a pronounced effect on GGH expression, whereas methylation of CpG2 was common in leukemia cells and normal leukocytes but did not significantly alter GGH expression. These findings indicate that GGH activity in human leukemia cells is regulated by epigenetic changes, in addition to previously recognized genetic polymorphisms and karyotypic abnormalities, which collectively determine interindividual differences in GGH activity and influence MTXPG accumulation in leukemia cells.",Journal Article,4977.0,29.0,Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase GGH catalyzes degradation active polyglutamates natural folates antifolate methotrexate MTX GGH activity directly related GGH messenger RNA expression acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients wild-type germline GGH genotype identified CpG islands CpG1 CpG2 region extending GGH promoter exon intron 1 showed methylation CpG islands GGH promoter seen leukemia approximately 15 patients nonhyperdiploid B-lineage associated significantly reduced GGH mRNA expression catalytic activity significantly higher accumulation MTX polyglutamates MTXPG 4-7 Furthermore methylation CpG1 leukemia-cell specific pronounced effect GGH expression methylation CpG2 common leukemia normal leukocytes significantly alter GGH expression findings indicate GGH activity human leukemia regulated epigenetic changes addition previously recognized genetic polymorphisms karyotypic abnormalities collectively determine interindividual differences GGH activity influence MTXPG accumulation leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1705, 15867, 18796, 10820, 11074, 2373, 1, 3, 544, 16243, 1, 1504, 28084, 2, 3, 12278, 2116, 3453, 21, 204, 17, 10820, 128, 16, 1606, 139, 6, 10820, 5992, 893, 55, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 37, 1, 7, 5, 8, 955, 267, 1009, 10820, 1183, 21, 108, 100, 2075, 6046, 44412, 2, 44413, 4, 3, 1053, 4782, 29, 3, 10820, 973, 298, 3, 157, 1725, 2, 237, 6259, 14, 2, 224, 17, 569, 1, 110, 2075, 6046, 4, 3, 10820, 973, 527, 4, 37, 29, 705, 167, 1, 7, 5, 26040, 132, 2542, 62, 16, 41, 5, 97, 405, 10820, 956, 55, 2, 4784, 128, 2, 5, 97, 142, 1835, 1, 3453, 16243, 11572, 39, 67, 4, 62, 37, 798, 569, 1, 44412, 10, 2647, 31, 112, 2, 42, 8, 3517, 254, 23, 10820, 55, 547, 569, 1, 44413, 10, 186, 4, 37, 2, 295, 6884, 84, 205, 44, 97, 2688, 10820, 55, 46, 272, 1008, 17, 10820, 128, 4, 171, 37, 16, 1065, 20, 1418, 400, 4, 352, 6, 373, 1904, 336, 1203, 2, 9465, 1171, 92, 2535, 223, 7882, 362, 4, 10820, 128, 2, 1054, 11572, 1835, 4, 37]",1268.0,16826517,Epigenetic regulation human gamma-glutamyl hydrolase activity acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

Cytogenet.,2006-08-01,"The prognostic significance of near-triploidy (68-80 chromosomes) and near-tetraploidy (>80 chromosomes) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the incidence of and outcome associated with these subtypes of ALL. In 620 children with ALL diagnosed between 1988 and 1999, the leukemic cells were near-triploid (DNA index, 1.50-1.73) in 4 and near-tetraploid (DNA index, 1.79-2.28) in 14. Of 15 patients with B-lineage ALL, 11 (73.3%) had an ETV6-RUNX1 (previously TEL-AML1 and then ETV6-CBFA2) fusion. No differences in age (P = 0.99), leukocyte count (P = 0.99), or immunophenotype (P = 0.99) were observed between patients with near-triploidy and those with near-tetraploidy. Patients with near-triploidy or near-tetraploidy were more likely than those with high-hyperdiploidy (51-67 chromosomes) (n = 159) to be female (P = 0.05) and have T-lineage ALL (P = 0.02), L2 morphology (P < 0.0001), or the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion (P < 0.0001). The median follow-up period was 10.4 years. The 5-year event-free survival estimates (+/- SE) were 75% +/- 19% for patients with near-triploidy, 93% +/- 7% for those with near-tetraploidy, and 84% +/- 3% for those with high-hyperdiploidy. Although near-triploidy and near-tetraploidy are biologically different from high-hyperdiploidy, the favorable outcomes of patients with any one of these abnormalities suggest that patients with B-lineage ALL and a DNA index >or= 1.16 can be included in the low-risk arm of treatment protocols.

This merger allowed analysis of clinical, biologic, and early response data predictive of event-free survival (EFS) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to develop a new classification system and treatment algorithm. From 11 779 children (age, 1 to 21.99 years) with newly diagnosed B-precursor ALL consecutively enrolled by the CCG (December 1988 to August 1995, n=4986) and POG (January 1986 to November 1999, n=6793), we retrospectively analyzed 6238 patients (CCG, 1182; POG, 5056) with informative cytogenetic data. Four risk groups were defined as very high risk (VHR; 5-year EFS, 45% or below), lower risk (5-year EFS, at least 85%), and standard and high risk (those remaining in the respective National Cancer Institute [NCI] risk groups). VHR criteria included extreme hypodiploidy (fewer than 44 chromosomes), t(9;22) and/or BCR/ABL, and induction failure. Lower-risk patients were NCI standard risk with either t(12;21) (TEL/AML1) or simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17. Even with treatment differences, there was high concordance between the CCG and POG analyses. The COG risk classification scheme is being used for division of B-precursor ALL into lower- (27%), standard- (32%), high- (37%), and very-high- (4%) risk groups based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, cytogenetics, day-14 marrow response, and end induction minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry in COG trials.",Journal Article,4865.0,270.0,Children 's Group CCG Pediatric Oncology Group POG joined form Children 's Oncology Group COG 2000 merger allowed clinical biologic early response predictive event-free survival EFS acute lymphoblastic leukemia develop new classification treatment algorithm 11 779 children age 1 21.99 years newly diagnosed B-precursor consecutively enrolled CCG December 1988 August 1995 n=4986 POG January 1986 November 1999 n=6793 retrospectively 6238 patients CCG 1182 POG 5056 informative cytogenetic risk groups defined high risk VHR 5-year EFS 45 lower risk 5-year EFS 85 standard high risk remaining respective National Institute NCI risk groups VHR criteria included extreme hypodiploidy fewer 44 chromosomes 9 22 and/or BCR/ABL induction failure Lower-risk patients NCI standard risk 12 21 TEL/AML1 simultaneous trisomies chromosomes 4 10 17 treatment differences high concordance CCG POG COG risk classification scheme division B-precursor lower- 27 standard- 32 high- 37 very-high- 4 risk groups based age white blood WBC count cytogenetics day-14 marrow response end induction minimal residual disease MRD flow cytometry COG trials,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 541, 292, 12, 87, 9457, 2, 3, 815, 413, 87, 17150, 17687, 6, 1297, 3, 541, 292, 413, 87, 6377, 4, 1081, 26, 38257, 2313, 65, 1, 38, 1283, 2, 191, 51, 74, 464, 1, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 6, 690, 8, 217, 947, 398, 2, 24, 2124, 29, 175, 7173, 541, 89, 14, 6, 239, 1058, 60, 5, 732, 265, 132, 2765, 62, 7380, 346, 20, 3, 9457, 1397, 3314, 6, 2480, 2323, 78, 55794, 2, 17150, 1024, 3751, 6, 2868, 2043, 78, 55795, 21, 894, 311, 55796, 7, 9457, 34153, 17150, 44488, 5, 4189, 1266, 74, 294, 43, 271, 11, 395, 22, 923, 64, 43, 12957, 33, 111, 1683, 512, 15, 2736, 280, 43, 33, 111, 1683, 28, 506, 772, 2, 260, 2, 64, 43, 135, 1844, 4, 3, 3847, 657, 12, 1377, 2580, 43, 271, 12957, 371, 159, 5611, 14828, 1497, 76, 584, 3560, 102, 83, 350, 2, 15, 1062, 1425, 2, 504, 496, 280, 43, 7, 11, 2580, 260, 43, 5, 361, 102, 133, 239, 8573, 6535, 15, 2824, 15526, 1, 3560, 39, 79, 2, 269, 871, 5, 24, 362, 125, 10, 64, 1827, 59, 3, 9457, 2, 17150, 318, 3, 6377, 43, 947, 4633, 16, 486, 95, 9, 5750, 1, 132, 2765, 62, 237, 280, 428, 260, 531, 64, 567, 2, 923, 64, 39, 43, 271, 90, 23, 89, 886, 315, 31, 4685, 1276, 2510, 218, 213, 581, 51, 2, 396, 504, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 20, 1412, 1914, 4, 6377, 143]",1461.0,17003380,Risk- response-based classification childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia combined prognostic markers Pediatric Oncology Group POG Children 's Group CCG,0,0.0
Gene expression-based chemical genomics identifies rapamycin as a modulator of MCL1 and glucocorticoid resistance.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2006-09-28,"Drug resistance remains a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. A database of drug-associated gene expression profiles was screened for molecules whose profile overlapped with a gene expression signature of glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity/resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The screen indicated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin profile matched the signature of GC sensitivity. We tested the hypothesis that rapamycin would induce GC sensitivity in lymphoid malignancy cells and found that it sensitized to GC-induced apoptosis via modulation of antiapoptotic MCL1. These data indicate that MCL1 is an important regulator of GC-induced apoptosis and that the combination of rapamycin and glucocorticoids has potential utility in lymphoid malignancies.

Outcome of 609 adults after relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); an MRC UKALL12/ECOG 2993 study.,Blood,Blood,2006-10-10,"Most adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who achieve complete remission (CR) will relapse. We examined the outcome of 609 adults with recurring ALL, all of whom were previously treated on the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALL12/ECOG2993 study, where the overall survival (OS) of newly diagnosed patients is 38% (95% confidence interval [CI]=36%-41%) at 5 years. By contrast, OS at 5 years after relapse was 7% (95% CI=4%-9%). Factors predicting a good outcome after salvage therapy were young age (OS of 12% in patients younger than 20 years vs OS of 3% in patients older than 50 years; 2P<.001) and short duration of first remission (CR1) (OS of 11% in those with a CR1 of more than 2 years versus OS of 5% in those with a CR1 of less than 2 years; 2P<.001). Treatment received in CR1 did not influence outcome after relapse. In a very highly selected subgroup of patients who were able to receive HSCT after relapse, some were long-term survivors.

Specific chromosomal abnormalities are associated with prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but chromosome abnormalities have not been evaluated for prognostic value in pediatric ALCL. For Children's Cancer Group protocol CCG-E-08 Etiologic Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Childhood, three patients were enrolled with cytogenetic analysis of ALCL and simultaneously enrolled on treatment protocol CCG-552. Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis underwent central review. Demographics included ages of 9, 12, and 14 years, and a male/female ratio of 1:2. All patients had advanced disease (stage III). Disease progressed or relapsed in two patients, and one died. Chromosomal abnormalities, including t(2;5)(p23;q35), the ALK/NPM fusion gene, and complex karyotypes with multiple additional abnormalities, were identified in all three patients. In two patients with progressive disease or relapse, additional chromosomal abnormalities at 1q21 and 10q24, possibly involving MCL1 and HOX11/TCL3, respectively, may have contributed to worse outcome.

Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2006-01-01,"Improved treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has virtually eliminated testicular relapse. However, the control of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia remains a therapeutic challenge in childhood ALL, partly because of the late complications arising from cranial irradiation. In most current pediatric protocols, cranial irradiation (12 to 18 Gy) is given to 5% to 25% of patients--those with T-cell ALL, overt CNS disease (CNS3 status) or high-risk cytogenetics. CNS control is a less urgent concern in adults with ALL, in whom systemic relapse remains the major problem. With current approaches, approximately 2% to 10% of patients can be expected to develop CNS relapse. Children with B-cell precursor ALL who have a late CNS relapse (after an initial remission of 18 months or more) and did not receive cranial irradiation have an excellent outcome after retrieval therapy, with a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate approaching that in newly diagnosed patients.

Heterogeneous CD52 expression among hematologic neoplasms: implications for the use of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H).,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-12-01,"CD52 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein expressed by B cells, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) is specific for CD52 and is Food and Drug Administration - approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The utility of CAMPATH in the treatment of other hematologic neoplasms has been explored; however, a comprehensive survey of CD52 expression among a broad spectrum of WHO-defined tumor types has not been completed. We evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms for the presence of CD52 using standard immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed with formalin, B-Plus, Zenker's acetic acid, or B5-formalin. The vast majority of low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas) express CD52. In addition, we found that the majority of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express this antigen. In contrast, there is surprising heterogeneity in CD52 expression among more aggressive B cell lymphomas, with 25% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating no detectable CD52. In addition, the majority of neoplasms of the T cell lineage are negative for the antigen, including most cases of precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Finally, the vast majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are negative for CD52 expression. In contrast with CLL, the variable expression of CD52 among other hematologic malignancies suggests that target validation on a case-by-case basis will likely be necessary to guide the rational analysis of CAMPATH therapy.",Journal Article,4799.0,102.0,CD52 GPI-linked glycoprotein expressed B monocytes macrophages humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab CAMPATH-1H specific CD52 Food Drug Administration approved treatment relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL utility CAMPATH treatment hematologic neoplasms explored comprehensive survey CD52 expression broad spectrum WHO-defined types completed evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms presence CD52 standard immunohistochemical techniques paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed formalin B-Plus Zenker 's acetic acid B5-formalin vast majority low-grade B lymphoproliferative disorders CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia follicular lymphoma lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma hairy leukemia mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas express CD52 addition majority precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express antigen contrast surprising heterogeneity CD52 expression aggressive B lymphomas 25 cases diffuse large B lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating detectable CD52 addition majority neoplasms lineage negative antigen including cases precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma anaplastic large lymphoma peripheral lymphoma specified Finally vast majority cases acute myeloid leukemia Hodgkin lymphoma multiple myeloma negative CD52 expression contrast CLL variable expression CD52 hematologic malignancies suggests target validation case-by-case basis likely necessary guide rational CAMPATH therapy,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[7189, 16, 8, 10344, 1199, 4455, 570, 20, 132, 37, 102, 37, 5078, 2, 2748, 3, 3619, 848, 548, 3579, 16622, 10147, 16, 112, 9, 7189, 2, 16, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 850, 9, 3, 24, 1, 591, 15, 430, 442, 1193, 552, 3, 1207, 1, 16622, 4, 3, 24, 1, 127, 813, 1179, 71, 85, 1443, 137, 8, 949, 1407, 1, 7189, 55, 107, 8, 2094, 1873, 1, 54, 395, 30, 630, 71, 44, 85, 781, 21, 194, 8375, 813, 1179, 9, 3, 463, 1, 7189, 75, 260, 1382, 1092, 23, 2487, 2505, 411, 623, 1959, 5, 3265, 132, 349, 55915, 292, 16812, 971, 15, 28617, 3265, 3, 4337, 686, 1, 154, 88, 132, 31, 4192, 1997, 552, 302, 1193, 1974, 5325, 7152, 31, 2, 2713, 41, 2303, 246, 1557, 1669, 7189, 4, 352, 21, 204, 17, 3, 686, 1, 2765, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 2647, 1557, 1669, 26, 448, 4, 748, 125, 16, 14157, 1144, 4, 7189, 55, 107, 80, 571, 132, 31, 1557, 5, 243, 1, 140, 1, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 2, 2219, 77, 2083, 7189, 4, 352, 3, 686, 1, 1179, 1, 3, 102, 31, 2542, 32, 199, 9, 3, 448, 141, 96, 140, 1, 2765, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 2647, 4763, 1841, 375, 31, 2, 672, 102, 31, 44, 2632, 3575, 1368, 3, 4337, 686, 1, 140, 1, 286, 533, 2, 232, 32, 199, 9, 7189, 55, 4, 748, 5, 552, 3, 1347, 55, 1, 7189, 107, 127, 813, 441, 844, 17, 283, 929, 23, 8, 473, 20, 473, 877, 303, 322, 40, 1493, 6, 1597, 3, 2696, 65, 1, 16622, 36]",1750.0,17145843,Heterogeneous CD52 expression hematologic neoplasms implications use alemtuzumab CAMPATH-1H,0,0.0
Karyotype is an independent prognostic factor in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): analysis of cytogenetic data from patients treated on the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALLXII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2993 trial.,Blood,Blood,2006-12-14,"Pretreatment cytogenetics is a known predictor of outcome in hematologic malignancies. However, its usefulness in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is generally limited to the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome because of the low incidence of other recurrent abnormalities. We present centrally reviewed cytogenetic data from 1522 adult patients enrolled on the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALLXII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2993 trial. The incidence and clinical associations for more than 20 specific chromosomal abnormalities are presented. Patients with a Ph chromosome, t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), complex karyotype (5 or more chromosomal abnormalities), or low hypodiploidy/near triploidy (Ho-Tr) all had inferior rates of event-free and overall survival when compared with other patients. In contrast, patients with high hyperdiploidy or a del(9p) had a significantly improved outcome.

Cytogenet.,2007-01-01,"Among pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, one of the most frequent types is lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). Specific chromosome abnormalities are associated with prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but have not been evaluated for prognostic value in pediatric LBL. For the Children's Cancer Group protocol CCG-E-08 Etiologic Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Childhood, 13 patients were enrolled with cytogenetic analysis of LBL and on treatment protocol CCG-502. Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis were given central review. The patients were aged 6-13 years (median 9 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 12:1. All patients had advanced disease. Disease relapsed in six patients (event-free survival 54% +/- 14%, median 10.8 years). Chromosome abnormalities were identified in 11 (85%), and translocations at 14q11.2 likely involving the T-cell receptor alpha/delta locus (TCR A/D) occurred in 4 (31%). For patients with relapse, four had translocations t(1;14)(p32;q11.2), t(8;14)(q24.1;q11.2), t(11;14)(p13;q11.2), or t(9;17)(q34;q23), involving breakpoints in the regions of TAL1, MYC, LMO2, and NOTCH1, respectively. Pediatric advanced LBLs have a high frequency of chromosome abnormalities; in this limited study, these often involved translocations at 14q11.2, the site of TCR A/D. Translocations possibly involving TAL1, MYC, LMO2, or NOTCH1 may have contributed to poor outcome.

Genomewide identification of prednisolone-responsive genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2007-01-11,"Glucocorticoids are keystone drugs in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To get more insight in signal transduction pathways involved in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, Affymetrix U133A GeneChips were used to identify transcriptionally regulated genes on 3 and 8 hours of prednisolone exposure in leukemic cells of 13 children as compared with nonexposed cells. Following 3 hours of exposure no significant changes in gene expression could be identified. Following 8 hours of exposure, 51 genes were differentially expressed (P < .001 and false discovery rate < 10%) with 39 genes being up-regulated (median, 2.4-fold) and 12 genes were down-regulated (median, 1.7-fold). Twenty-one of those genes have not been identified before to be transcriptionally regulated by prednisolone. Two of the 3 most highly up-regulated genes were tumor suppressor genes, that is, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP; 3.7-fold) and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16; 8.8-fold). About 50% of the differentially expressed genes were functionally categorized in 3 major routes, namely MAPK pathways (9 genes), NF-kappaB signaling (11 genes), and carbohydrate metabolism (5 genes).

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2007-02-01,"In hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), natural killer cell alloreactivity conferred by inhibitory ligands of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRLs) may result in beneficial or detrimental outcomes. More data may contribute to resolution of this complex issue. We analyzed 378 primary allogeneic transplants with T-replete grafts for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 101), acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 149), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 128). The cohort was divided into 3 groups: in group 1, HLA class I matched at the antigen level (n = 260); in group 2, HLA class I mismatched at the antigen level (n = 57); and in group 3, HLA class I and iKIRLs mismatched (n = 61). One-year overall survival (OS) across groups 1 (59%), 2 (49%), and 3 (30%) was significantly different (P = .002). In contrast to group 2, group 3 had statistically lower OS (P = .05) and event-free survival (P = .01). Relapse and relapse-free mortality appeared to contribute to the low OS in group 3. The detrimental effect of natural killer alloreactivity was also evident when HLA-matched transplants were analyzed for patients lacking iKIRLs. One-year OS in patients lacking the HLA-Cw group 1 or 2 iKIRL was significantly lower than that in patients having the iKIRLs (55% vs 67%, n = 246, P = .01).

The aim was to compare differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between patients who did and did not achieve asparagine depletion, defined by enzyme levels greater than 0.03 U/mL plasma for 14 consecutive days after at least 1 of 4 planned PEG-ASP administrations. Samples were available from 85 eligible patients.

Ancestry and pharmacogenetics of antileukemic drug toxicity.,Blood,Blood,2007-01-30,"Treatment-related toxicity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can not only be life threatening but may also affect relapse risk. In 240 patients, we determined whether toxicities were related to 16 polymorphisms in genes linked to the pharmacodynamics of ALL chemotherapy, adjusting for age, race (self-reported or via ancestry-informative markers), sex, and disease risk group (lower- vs higher-risk therapy). Toxicities (gastrointestinal, infectious, hepatic, and neurologic) were assessed in each treatment phase. During the induction phase, when drugs subject to the steroid/cytochrome P4503A pathway predominated, genotypes in that pathway were important: vitamin D receptor (odds ratio [OR], 6.85 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-27.0]) and cytochrome P4503A5 (OR, 4.61 [95% CI, 1.11-19.2]) polymorphisms were related to gastrointestinal toxicity and infection, respectively. During the consolidation phase, when antifolates predominated, the reduced folate carrier polymorphism predicted gastrointestinal toxicity (OR, 10.4 [95% CI, 1.35-80.4]) as it also did during continuation (OR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.06-4.11]). In all 3 treatment phases, a glucuronosyltransferase polymorphism predicted hyperbilirubinemia (P = .017, P < .001, and P < .001) and methotrexate clearance (P = .028), which was also independently associated with hyperbilirubinemia (P = .026).

Favorable outcome for adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Consortium Protocols.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-03-01,"Historically, adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have had inferior outcomes when compared with younger children. We report the outcome of adolescents treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI; Boston, MA) ALL Consortium Protocols conducted between 1991 and 2000. A total of 844 patients aged 1 to 18 years, with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled onto two consecutive DFCI-ALL Consortium Protocols. We compared outcomes in three age groups: children aged 1 to 10 years (n = 685), young adolescents aged 10 to 15 years (n = 108), and older adolescents aged 15 to 18 years (n = 51). With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for those aged 1 to 10 years was 85% (SE, 1%), compared with 77% (SE, 4%) for those aged 10 to 15 years, and 78% (SE, 6%) for those aged 15 to 18 years (P = .09). Adolescents were more likely to present with T-cell phenotype (P < .001) and less likely to have the TEL-AML1 fusion (P = .05). The incidence of pancreatitis and thromboembolic complications, but not asparaginase allergy, was higher in patients 10 years of age compared with those younger than 10 years. However, there was no difference in the rate of treatment-related complications between the 10- to 15-year and 15- to 18-year age groups. Adolescents were more likely to present at diagnosis with biologically higher risk disease (T-cell phenotype and absence of the TEL-AML1 fusion) and more likely to experience treatment-related complications than younger children. However, the 5-year EFS for older adolescents was 78% +/- 6%, which is superior to published outcomes for similarly aged patients treated with other pediatric and adult ALL regimens.

Growth factors in leukemia.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2007-02-01,"The role of myeloid growth factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, in the management of acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemias has been evaluated extensively in multiple clinical trials. Growth factors have been given before, concurrently, or sequentially with chemotherapy with the goal of reducing the duration of neutropenia and consequently the incidence and severity of infections, and improving the rate of remissions and overall survival. They also have been studied as chemotherapy-sensitizing agents in an effort to recruit dormant myeloid stem cells into the sensitive phase of the cycle. Additionally, growth factors, shown to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells in vitro, were evaluated as monotherapy in patients with acute leukemia. Most studies show modest improvement in the duration of the neutropenia, which does not consistently correlate with the severity of infection, rate or duration of remissions, or disease-free and overall survival. Attempts to enhance the chemosensitivity of the leukemic cells and decrease drug resistance failed to improve the rate of remission and survival in several large series. However, more recent reports suggested an improved outcome in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.

All patients were refractory to at least one multiagent regimen or had relapsed after achieving a complete remission. Nelarabine was administered on an alternate day schedule (days 1, 3, and 5) at 1.5 g/m(2)/day. Cycles were repeated every 22 days. The median age was 34 years (range, 16-66 years); 32 (82%) patients were male. The rate of complete remission was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%, 48%) and the overall response rate was 41% (95% CI, 26%, 58%).

Therefore, a retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the incidence of PCP in pediatric patients who received prophylactic atovaquone during treatment for acute leukemia. We reviewed the medical records of all patients treated at our institution for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia between 1994 and 2004. Only patients who were intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) and received atovaquone prophylaxis were included in the analysis. Eighty-six patients were unable to tolerate TMP-SMZ and received daily atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis. PCP was not diagnosed in any patient who received atovaquone prophylaxis: the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.74 per 100 person-years.

Cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms as a first event after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,JAMA,JAMA,2007-03-01,"Little is known about the incidence of secondary neoplasms after 15 to 20 years in children and adolescents who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To investigate the cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms in pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia over 30 years and to characterize late-occurring tumors. Retrospective study of 2169 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated between 1962 and 1998 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenn, who achieved complete remission and had a median follow-up time of 18.7 years (range, 2.4-41.3 years). Cumulative incidences of secondary neoplasms in first remission and standard incidence ratios of observed rates compared with rates of cancer development in the general US population. Secondary neoplasms developed as the first event in 123 patients and comprised 46 myeloid malignancies, 3 lymphomas, 14 basal cell carcinomas, 16 other carcinomas, 6 sarcomas, 16 meningiomas, and 22 other brain tumors. The cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasm was 4.17% (SE, 0.46%) at 15 years and increased substantially after 20 years, reaching 10.85% (SE, 1.27%) at 30 years. When meningiomas and basal cell carcinomas were excluded, the overall cumulative incidence was 3.99% (SE, 0.44%) at 15 years and 6.27% (SE, 0.83%) at 30 years, representing a 13.5-fold increase in overall risk compared with the general population. The cumulative incidence of each tumor type at 30 years was 2.19% (SE, 0.32%) for myeloid malignancy, 0.17% (SE, 0.10%) for lymphoma, 3.00% (SE, 0.59%) for brain tumor, 4.91% (SE, 1.04%) for carcinoma, and 0.57% (SE, 0.37%) for sarcoma. The cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms increases steadily over 30 years after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although the majority of the late-occurring secondary neoplasms are low-grade tumors, the increase in incidence of more aggressive malignant neoplasms is significantly higher than expected in the general population.

Mesenchymal cells regulate the response of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to asparaginase.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2007-03-22,"Because of their low asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression and asparagine biosynthesis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are exquisitely sensitive to asparagine depletion. Consequently, asparaginase is a major component of ALL therapy, but the mechanisms regulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to this agent are unclear. In 288 children with ALL, cellular ASNS expression was more likely to be high in T-lineage ALL and low in B-lineage ALL with TEL-AML1 or hyperdiploidy. However, ASNS expression levels in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs), which form the microenvironment where leukemic cells grow, were on average 20 times higher than those in ALL cells. MSCs protected ALL cells from asparaginase cytotoxicity in coculture experiments. This protective effect correlated with levels of ASNS expression: downregulation by RNA interference decreased the capacity of MSCs to protect ALL cells from asparaginase, whereas enforced ASNS expression conferred enhanced protection. Asparagine secretion by MSCs was directly related to their ASNS expression levels, suggesting a mechanism - increased concentrations of asparagine in the leukemic cell microenvironment - for the protective effects we observed. These results provide what we believe to be a new basis for understanding asparaginase resistance in ALL and indicate that MSC niches in the bone marrow can form a safe haven for leukemic cells.",Journal Article,4688.0,209.0,low asparagine synthetase ASNS expression asparagine biosynthesis acute lymphoblastic leukemia exquisitely sensitive asparagine depletion Consequently asparaginase major component therapy mechanisms regulating susceptibility leukemic agent unclear 288 children cellular ASNS expression likely high T-lineage low B-lineage TEL-AML1 hyperdiploidy ASNS expression levels bone marrow-derived mesenchymal MSCs form microenvironment leukemic grow average 20 times higher MSCs protected asparaginase cytotoxicity coculture experiments protective effect correlated levels ASNS expression downregulation RNA interference decreased capacity MSCs protect asparaginase enforced ASNS expression conferred enhanced protection Asparagine secretion MSCs directly related ASNS expression levels suggesting mechanism increased concentrations asparagine leukemic microenvironment protective effects observed provide believe new basis understanding asparaginase resistance indicate MSC niches bone marrow form safe leukemic,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[408, 1, 136, 154, 14108, 12692, 16063, 55, 2, 14108, 6225, 286, 1275, 62, 37, 32, 11936, 745, 6, 14108, 2286, 3244, 3709, 16, 8, 458, 1249, 1, 62, 36, 84, 3, 483, 2681, 3, 1432, 1, 2015, 37, 6, 26, 420, 32, 1200, 4, 8603, 541, 5, 62, 763, 16063, 55, 10, 80, 322, 6, 40, 64, 4, 102, 2542, 62, 2, 154, 4, 132, 2542, 62, 5, 8573, 6535, 15, 11299, 137, 16063, 55, 148, 4, 581, 526, 1569, 37, 4460, 92, 1297, 3, 995, 1257, 2015, 37, 6265, 11, 23, 1011, 179, 1072, 142, 76, 135, 4, 62, 37, 4460, 5541, 62, 37, 29, 3709, 1408, 4, 7604, 2332, 26, 2864, 254, 438, 5, 148, 1, 16063, 55, 2475, 20, 893, 3182, 340, 3, 2162, 1, 4460, 6, 4869, 62, 37, 29, 3709, 547, 7807, 16063, 55, 3851, 651, 3525, 14108, 2935, 20, 4460, 10, 1606, 139, 6, 136, 16063, 55, 148, 802, 8, 670, 101, 1003, 1, 14108, 4, 3, 2015, 31, 995, 9, 3, 2864, 176, 21, 164, 46, 99, 377, 2067, 21, 4629, 6, 40, 8, 217, 877, 9, 612, 3709, 251, 4, 62, 2, 1008, 17, 4150, 8005, 4, 3, 581, 122, 1297, 8, 1165, 17251, 9, 2015, 37]",1381.0,17380207,Mesenchymal regulate response acute lymphoblastic leukemia asparaginase,12,0.013114754098360656
Novel Abl kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,2007-03-01,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is associated with a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 to produce a fusion gene (bcr-abl) that gives rise to a constitutively activated Abl tyrosine kinase. This kinase led to the discovery of several small-molecule inhibitors, imatinib being the first and most successful of these.

Decreased adult height in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,The Journal of pediatrics,J. Pediatr.,2007-04-01,"To determine risk factors associated with reduced adult height in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This was a cross-sectional study. Attained adult height was determined among 2434 ALL survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of common pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with 3009 siblings. All survivor treatment exposure groups (chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy with cranial or craniospinal radiotherapy) had decreased adult height and an increased risk of adult short stature (height standard deviation score < -2) compared with siblings (P < .001). Compared with siblings, the risk of short stature for survivors treated with chemotherapy alone was elevated (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9, 6.0). Among survivors, significant risk factors for short stature included diagnosis of ALL before puberty, higher-dose cranial radiotherapy (> or = 20 Gy versus < 20 Gy), any radiotherapy to the spine, and female sex. Survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of adult short stature, including those treated with chemotherapy alone.

Between 1979 and 1984, 456 children with newly diagnosed ALL and lymphoma were enrolled onto a single protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). The heights and weights of 422 of the children were measured at diagnosis, during treatment, at the end of therapy, and approximately every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Patients who had attained their adult height at the time of analysis (n = 248) were placed in weight categories based on their BMI, BMI percentile, or weight-for-length percentile depending on age. The overall percentage of survivors who were overweight or obese approximated rates prevalent in the general population of the United States. Young age (< 6 years) and overweight/obesity at diagnosis were the best predictors of obesity at adult height. The rate of BMI increase did not differ significantly between children who received radiation and those who did not, nor between patients who received 18 or 24 Gy of cranial radiation.

A set of genes that regulate cell proliferation predicts treatment outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2007-04-24,"To identify novel predictors of outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we analyzed gene expression in the leukemic cells of 187 children with newly diagnosed ALL and compared the findings with minimal residual disease (MRD) results obtained on day 19 of remission induction treatment. Genes that showed a significant relationship to MRD were then tested for their capacity to predict leukemic relapse in an independent cohort of 99 patients. We identified 674 probe sets that were associated with MRD on day 19 (P < .006); 40 of the identified genes predicted relapse (P < .03). Among these, 14 showed independent prognostic significance after adjustment for age, leukocyte count at diagnosis, and genetic subtype. More than half of the 40 genes and nearly all of the 14 genes were functionally related, as indicated by their roles in the regulation of cell proliferation. Underexpression of genes promoting cell proliferation was associated with resistance to chemotherapy.

Quantitative analysis of minimal residual disease predicts relapse in children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia in DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01.,Blood,Blood,2007-05-07,"In a prospective trial in 284 children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we assessed the clinical utility of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of antigen receptor gene rearrangements for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) to identify children at high risk of relapse. At the end of induction therapy, the 5-year risk of relapse was 5% in 176 children with no detectable MRD and 44% in 108 children with detectable MRD (P < .001), with a linear association of the level of MRD and subsequent relapse.

Characterization of ABL1 expression in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by oligonucleotide array analysis.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2007-05-01,"Recent data have highlighted an involvement of ABL1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Specifically, the presence of a fusion gene involving ABL1 and NUP214, both located at 9q34, has been reported. We sought to evaluate whether T-ALL patients with overexpression of ABL showed a peculiar gene expression pattern and were characterized by having specific rearrangements. We previously assessed the expression profile of 128 adults with ALL by oligonucleotide arrays: 33 had T-ALL. In the current study, we evaluated the expression levels of ABL1 in T-ALL cases and found three patients who had ABL1 levels comparable to those detected in BCR/ABL (+)cases and one who had a significantly higher level of ABL1 expression. In order to establish the incidence of ABL1 overexpression in T-ALL, we evaluated 17 additional patients by quantitative (Q)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The three cases with ABL1 expression levels comparable to those found in BCR/ABL (+)cases had a specific signature characterized by a high expression of genes involved in regulation of transcription. The fourth case, with the highest levels of ABL, harbored the NUP214-ABL1 rearrangement, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Three of the four patients were refractory to induction chemotherapy. Of the 17 additional patients evaluated by Q-PCR and RT-PCR, none showed ABL1 overexpression. Overall, overexpression of ABL1 was found in 8% of T-ALL cases. These results underline the value of microarray analyses for the identification of specific signatures associated with ABL1 overexpression, as well as rearrangements, e.g. NUP214-ABL1, in adult T-ALL.",Evaluation Study,4648.0,12.0,Recent highlighted involvement ABL1 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL Specifically presence fusion involving ABL1 NUP214 located 9q34 reported sought evaluate T-ALL patients overexpression ABL showed peculiar expression pattern characterized specific rearrangements previously assessed expression profile 128 adults oligonucleotide arrays 33 T-ALL current evaluated expression levels ABL1 T-ALL cases patients ABL1 levels comparable detected BCR/ABL cases significantly higher level ABL1 expression order establish incidence ABL1 overexpression T-ALL evaluated 17 additional patients quantitative Q -polymerase chain reaction PCR reverse transcription RT -PCR cases ABL1 expression levels comparable BCR/ABL cases specific signature characterized high expression involved regulation transcription fourth case highest levels ABL harbored NUP214-ABL1 rearrangement confirmed fluorescence situ hybridization FISH patients refractory induction chemotherapy 17 additional patients evaluated Q-PCR RT-PCR showed ABL1 overexpression Overall overexpression ABL1 8 T-ALL cases underline value microarray identification specific signatures associated ABL1 overexpression rearrangements e.g NUP214-ABL1 adult T-ALL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[435, 74, 47, 3681, 35, 799, 1, 3557, 4, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 1225, 3, 463, 1, 8, 1212, 145, 1267, 3557, 2, 31098, 110, 2308, 28, 19805, 71, 85, 210, 21, 990, 6, 376, 317, 102, 62, 7, 5, 851, 1, 1425, 224, 8, 21179, 145, 55, 1177, 2, 11, 765, 20, 1041, 112, 2072, 21, 373, 275, 3, 55, 800, 1, 3990, 857, 5, 62, 20, 4727, 3923, 466, 42, 102, 62, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 194, 3, 55, 148, 1, 3557, 4, 102, 62, 140, 2, 204, 169, 7, 54, 42, 3557, 148, 1279, 6, 135, 530, 4, 1062, 1425, 140, 2, 104, 54, 42, 8, 97, 142, 301, 1, 3557, 55, 4, 1732, 6, 1811, 3, 287, 1, 3557, 851, 4, 102, 62, 21, 194, 269, 402, 7, 20, 1156, 4170, 1451, 1260, 1329, 604, 2, 1772, 866, 240, 604, 3, 169, 140, 5, 3557, 55, 148, 1279, 6, 135, 204, 4, 1062, 1425, 140, 42, 8, 112, 1651, 765, 20, 8, 64, 55, 1, 214, 646, 4, 863, 1, 866, 3, 3608, 473, 5, 3, 1076, 148, 1, 1425, 3253, 3, 31098, 3557, 2675, 92, 10, 557, 20, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 1277, 169, 1, 3, 294, 7, 11, 430, 6, 504, 56, 1, 3, 269, 402, 7, 194, 20, 4170, 604, 2, 240, 604, 1292, 224, 3557, 851, 63, 851, 1, 3557, 10, 204, 4, 66, 1, 102, 62, 140, 46, 99, 22051, 3, 549, 1, 1727, 318, 9, 3, 911, 1, 112, 2210, 41, 5, 3557, 851, 22, 149, 22, 2072, 563, 499, 31098, 3557, 4, 780, 102, 62]",1658.0,17488685,Characterization ABL1 expression adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oligonucleotide array,8,0.008743169398907104
Dasatinib induces rapid hematologic and cytogenetic responses in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance or intolerance to imatinib: interim results of a phase 2 study.,Blood,Blood,2007-05-11,"Patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a rapid disease course and a poor prognosis. Dasatinib, a novel, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases, has previously induced responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant Ph-positive ALL. We present the interim results of a phase 2 study designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dasatinib 140 mg in this patient population (n = 36). With a minimum follow-up of 8 months, treatment with dasatinib resulted in substantial hematologic and cytogenetic response rates. Major hematologic responses were achieved in 42% (15/36) of patients, 67% of whom remained progression-free. Complete cytogenetic responses were attained by 58% (21/36) of patients. The presence of BCR-ABL mutations conferring imatinib resistance did not preclude a response to dasatinib. Dasatinib was also tolerable, with 6% (2/36) of patients discontinuing therapy as a result of study-drug toxicity. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2; febrile neutropenia was the most frequent severe AE, but this and other cytopenias were manageable with dose reduction. Dasatinib represents a safe and effective treatment option and an important therapeutic advance for patients with Ph-positive ALL.

The purpose of this study was to summarize the instrument outcomes when a widely used health-related quality of life instrument (the Health Utilities Index 3 [HUI3]) created from a population-based strategy was completed by pediatric oncology nurses for their patients during cancer treatment. Fifty-four nurses completed the HUI3 a total of 261 times at 1 to 3 sequential data points (106, 94, and 61, respectively) for pediatric patients who were enrolled on a frontline therapeutic clinical trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Data were collected at 2 children's hospitals. HUI3 scores could not be calculated for 52% to 61% of the nurse reports at each of the 3 data points because of nurses' use of the ""do not know"" response option. Missing data of this proportion indicate that the nurse serving as a proxy rater independent of directly soliciting responses from the patient will not be able to rate certain attributes of the HUI3 more than half of the time despite having ongoing familiarity with the patient.

Hyperglycemia in patients with acute myeloid leukemia is associated with increased hospital mortality.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-07-01,"Hyperglycemia is often observed in medically ill patients. Previous studies have shown that patients with hyperglycemia during induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia develop more infections and have shorter disease-free survival. The authors hypothesized that hyperglycemia may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and sought to determine whether this association exists in this population. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study to examine the relation between hyperglycemia and hospital mortality in patients with the diagnosis of AML. Two hundred eighty-three adult patients were treated over a 3-year period. All hospitalizations were reviewed during the study period, and glucose exposure and outcomes were quantified. Hyperglycemia during a patient's hospitalization was associated with increased hospital mortality (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.23-1.55; P < .001) after adjusting for covariates, including disease state, treatment type, and response. The rise in mortality was evident at even mild levels (110-150 mg/dL) of glucose elevation.

A phase 1 clinical-laboratory study of clofarabine followed by cyclophosphamide for adults with refractory acute leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2007-06-11,"Clofarabine has shown impressive response rates in patients with acute leukemias. In vitro investigations with clofarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide in primary cells have demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity and inhibition of DNA repair. Based on these clinical and laboratory observations, we designed a mechanism-based combination protocol with clofarabine and cyclophosphamide for patients with relapsed acute leukemias. Eighteen patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m(2)) alone on day 0 and with clofarabine plus cyclophosphamide on day 1. Clinical responses, toxicity, DNA damage measured as H2AX phosphorylation, and accumulation of clofarabine triphosphate (TP) were analyzed. At dose level 1 (20 mg/m(2) clofarabine + cyclophosphamide, 6 patients) and dose level 0 (10 mg/m(2) clofarabine + cyclophosphamide, 12 patients) overall response rates were 50% and 30%, respectively, with responses in 4 (67%) of 6 patients with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dose-limiting toxicity occurred at dose level 1 with prolonged marrow aplasia. Four (22%) patients died from prolonged aplasia (1), fungal pneumonia (1), or multiorgan failure (2). In 12 of 13 patient samples, increased DNA damage (gammaH2AX) was observed with clofarabine and cyclophosphamide compared with cyclophosphamide alone. In conclusion, pharmacodynamic end points along with clinical results suggest usefulness of this combination strategy, whereas toxicity data suggest reduction in chemotherapeutic intensity.

Physical inactivity in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2007-07-01,"To determine if adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are less active (and more inactive) than the general population and to identify modifying factors. Physical activity was assessed by self-report in 2,648 adult survivors of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Participants in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used as a comparison group. Survivors had a mean age of 28.7 years (range, 18.0-44.0 years) and were a mean of 23.1 years from their cancer diagnosis (range, 16.0-33.8 years). In multivariate models, ALL survivors were more likely to not meet CDC recommendations for physical activity [odds ratio (OR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.32-1.57] and more likely to be inactive (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.56-1.94) in comparison with the BRFSS general population. Survivors treated with >20-Gy cranial radiotherapy were at particular risk. Compared with BRFSS participants and adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity, survivors were more likely to not meet CDC recommendations (females: OR, 2.07, 95% CI, 1.67-2.56; males: OR, 1.43, 95% CI, 1.16-1.76) and more likely to be inactive (females: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.50-2.31; males: OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.45-2.32).

Drug evaluation: Nilotinib - a novel Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia and beyond.,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,IDrugs,2007-07-01,"Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) is caused by the constitutively active tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl. Inhibitors ofBcr-Abl have significantly improved the treatment of CML. Most notable is the inhibitor imatinib, which produces remissions in all phases of CML and is the current standard of care. However, imatinib resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients, mainly through the development of mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that impair imatinib binding. Attempts to circumvent resistance to imatinib led to the discovery of nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis AG), a novel, potent and selective oral Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance. Efficacy has been observed in models of CML and other myeloproliferative disorders that are driven by Bcr-Abl and related kinases. In a phase II clinical trial in CML, major cytogenetic response rates were 52 and 33% for chronic- and accelerated-phase disease, respectively. Nilotinib has been filed for approval in the US and EU for use in Philadelphia-positive leukemias in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.

Timing of menarche among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008-04-01,"The objective of this study was to determine risk factors associated with abnormal timing of menarche among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Self-reported age of menarche was determined among 949 female ALL survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a cohort of 5-year survivors of common pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with 1,128 siblings. The majority of survivors (92%) and siblings (97%) reported menarche between the ages of 10 and 16. Survivors treated with chemotherapy alone, including those exposed to alkylating agents, experienced menarche at a similar rate to siblings. However, compared to chemotherapy alone, cranial radiotherapy was associated with early menarche (age < 10; OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.1, 18.5) while craniospinal radiotherapy was associated with both early (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.9, 38.6) and late (age > 16; OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.4, 16.7) menarche. There were no differences in effect between <20 and >/=20 Gy radiotherapy doses. In multivariable analysis, younger age at diagnosis was an independent risk factor for early menarche. Few female childhood ALL survivors experienced menarche outside of the normal range. Alkylating agent exposure was not associated with abnormal timing.

"Reproductive history, infertility treatment, and the risk of acute leukemia in children with down syndrome: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.",Cancer,Cancer,2007-11-01,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) have from 10 to 20 times the risk of developing acute leukemia than the general pediatric population. There is mixed evidence for associations between reproductive history or infertility and acute leukemia among children without DS. The authors conducted a case-control study of acute leukemia among children with DS to investigate possible risk factors in this population. From 1997 to 2002, 158 children aged <20 years with DS who had a diagnosis of acute leukemia (97 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] and 61 children with acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) were enrolled at Children's Oncology Group (COG) institutions. Controls with DS (n = 173) were selected from the cases' primary care clinic and frequency matched to cases on age. Telephone interviews were conducted with mothers of cases and controls assessing reproductive history, infertility, and infertility treatment. Null results were observed overall and by subtype for reproductive factors, including previous pregnancy outcomes and contraceptive use, and for most infertility outcomes. There was an increased risk of AML among children with DS whose parents had ever tried for >/=1 year to become pregnant (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14-4.33). A 1-year increase in maternal age also was associated with AML (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12). Although the questionnaire was limited in this area, the results suggested that the risk for AML may be raised in children with DS because of infertility. In that the risk of infertility, along with having a child with DS, increase with age, these results warrant more research.",Journal Article,4464.0,18.0,Children syndrome DS 10 20 times risk developing acute leukemia general pediatric population mixed evidence associations reproductive history infertility acute leukemia children DS authors conducted case-control acute leukemia children DS investigate possible risk factors population 1997 2002 158 children aged 20 years DS diagnosis acute leukemia 97 children acute lymphoblastic leukemia 61 children acute myeloid leukemia AML enrolled Children 's Oncology Group COG institutions Controls DS n 173 selected cases primary care clinic frequency matched cases age Telephone interviews conducted mothers cases controls assessing reproductive history infertility infertility treatment Null observed overall subtype reproductive factors including previous pregnancy outcomes contraceptive use infertility outcomes increased risk AML children DS parents tried /=1 year pregnant odds ratio 2.22 95 confidence interval 95 CI 1.14-4.33 1-year increase maternal age associated AML 1.06 95 CI 1.01-1.12 questionnaire limited area suggested risk AML raised children DS infertility risk infertility child DS increase age warrant research,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[541, 5, 1328, 681, 3602, 47, 29, 79, 6, 179, 1072, 3, 43, 1, 931, 286, 76, 3, 1083, 815, 266, 125, 16, 1739, 241, 9, 685, 59, 3705, 532, 15, 5901, 2, 286, 107, 541, 187, 3602, 3, 738, 426, 8, 473, 182, 45, 1, 286, 107, 541, 5, 3602, 6, 963, 899, 43, 130, 4, 26, 266, 29, 2341, 6, 1544, 5162, 541, 1032, 179, 60, 5, 3602, 54, 42, 8, 147, 1, 286, 1015, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 713, 541, 5, 286, 533, 329, 11, 346, 28, 541, 292, 413, 87, 6377, 1764, 535, 5, 3602, 78, 5785, 11, 715, 29, 3, 140, 86, 165, 1188, 2, 675, 655, 6, 140, 23, 89, 4258, 4053, 11, 426, 5, 8605, 1, 140, 2, 535, 1977, 3705, 532, 5901, 2, 5901, 24, 3505, 99, 11, 164, 63, 2, 20, 875, 9, 3705, 130, 141, 698, 2290, 123, 2, 6780, 119, 2, 9, 96, 5901, 123, 125, 10, 35, 101, 43, 1, 329, 107, 541, 5, 3602, 1310, 2418, 42, 3353, 13780, 9, 14, 111, 6, 1417, 6086, 610, 197, 15, 18, 350, 48, 307, 268, 48, 58, 14, 213, 39, 466, 8, 14, 111, 344, 4, 6039, 89, 120, 10, 41, 5, 329, 15, 14, 1460, 48, 58, 14, 355, 14, 133, 242, 3, 1770, 10, 383, 4, 26, 965, 3, 99, 1148, 17, 3, 43, 9, 329, 68, 40, 5673, 4, 541, 5, 3602, 408, 1, 5901, 4, 17, 3, 43, 1, 5901, 1510, 5, 1041, 8, 2566, 5, 3602, 344, 5, 89, 46, 99, 2946, 80, 389]",1553.0,17849462,Reproductive history infertility treatment risk acute leukemia children syndrome report Children 's Oncology Group,1,0.001092896174863388

Clofarabine is thought to work via three mechanisms: inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase; incorporation to DNA; and induction of apoptosis. Given these mechanism of action, clofarabine would be predicted to act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents such as other purine nucleoside analogues and DNA damaging or cross linking agents such as anthracyclines and platinum-based compounds. Intravenous clofarabine showed significant efficacy in pediatric leukemias (specifically, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) and, in 2004, it was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pediatric relapsed/refractory ALL after at least two regimens. In adults, clofarabine has shown significant efficacy in hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) alone and in combinations.

Genetically targeted T cells eradicate systemic acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-09-12,"Human T cells targeted to the B cell-specific CD19 antigen through retroviral-mediated transfer of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), termed 19z1, have shown significant but partial in vivo antitumor efficacy in a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-Beige systemic human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NALM-6) tumor model. Here, we investigate the etiologies of treatment failure in this model and design approaches to enhance the efficacy of this adoptive strategy. A panel of modified CD19-targeted CARs designed to deliver combined activating and costimulatory signals to the T cell was generated and tested in vitro to identify an optimal second-generation CAR. Antitumor efficacy of T cells expressing this optimal costimulatory CAR, 19-28z, was analyzed in mice bearing systemic costimulatory ligand-deficient NALM-6 tumors. Expression of the 19-28z CAR, containing the signaling domain of the CD28 receptor, enhanced systemic T-cell antitumor activity when compared with 19z1 in treated mice. A treatment schedule of 4 weekly T-cell injections, designed to prolong in vivo T-cell function, further improved long-term survival.

Aggressive Langerhans cell histiocytosis following T-ALL: clonally related neoplasms with persistent expression of constitutively active NOTCH1.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2008-02-01,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and related entities are neoplasms of unknown pathogenesis. Here, we describe studies assessing the role of NOTCH1 mutations in LCH, which were based on a case of fatal Langerhans cell tumor after T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although the two types of neoplasm in this patient were temporally and pathologically distinct, molecular analyses showed that they harbored the same T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and two activating NOTCH1 mutations involving exons 27 and 34. The exon 27 mutation altered a conserved cysteine residue in the N-terminal portion of the NOTCH1 heterodimerization domain, while the mutation in exon 34 introduced a premature stop codon that results in the deletion of C-terminal negative regulatory PEST domain. Analysis of cDNA prepared from the aggressive Langerhans cell tumor showed that the NOTCH1 mutations were aligned in cis, a configuration that caused synergistic increases in NOTCH1 signal strength in reporter gene assays. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the Langerhans cell tumor also expressed NOTCH1 protein. Although these data suggested that NOTCH1 mutations might contribute to the pathogenesis of typical sporadic LCH and related neoplasms occurring in the absence of T-ALL, an analysis of 24 cases of LCH and Rosai-Dorfman Disease occurring in patients without an antecedent history of T-ALL revealed no mutations. Thus, activating NOTCH1 mutations appear to be unique to aggressive Langerhans cell tumors occurring after T-ALL. Persistent expression of NOTCH1 in such tumors suggests that Notch pathway inhibitors could have a role in the treatment of these unusual neoplasms.",Case Reports,4372.0,37.0,Langerhans histiocytosis LCH related entities neoplasms unknown pathogenesis studies assessing role NOTCH1 LCH based case fatal Langerhans T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL types neoplasm patient temporally pathologically distinct molecular showed harbored T-cell receptor rearrangements activating NOTCH1 involving exons 27 34 exon 27 altered conserved cysteine residue N-terminal portion NOTCH1 heterodimerization domain exon 34 introduced premature stop codon deletion C-terminal negative regulatory PEST domain cDNA prepared aggressive Langerhans showed NOTCH1 aligned cis configuration caused synergistic increases NOTCH1 signal strength reporter Immunohistochemistry confirmed Langerhans expressed NOTCH1 suggested NOTCH1 contribute pathogenesis typical sporadic LCH related neoplasms occurring absence T-ALL 24 cases LCH Rosai-Dorfman Disease occurring patients antecedent history T-ALL revealed activating NOTCH1 appear unique aggressive Langerhans occurring T-ALL Persistent expression NOTCH1 suggests Notch pathway inhibitors role treatment unusual neoplasms,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[15702, 31, 13976, 19131, 2, 139, 4613, 32, 1179, 1, 860, 1384, 467, 21, 897, 94, 1977, 3, 200, 1, 4607, 138, 4, 19131, 92, 11, 90, 23, 8, 473, 1, 3034, 15702, 31, 30, 50, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 242, 3, 100, 630, 1, 2131, 4, 26, 69, 11, 11114, 2, 2998, 834, 219, 318, 224, 17, 491, 3253, 3, 827, 102, 31, 153, 145, 2072, 2, 100, 1616, 4607, 138, 1267, 3885, 428, 2, 562, 3, 1725, 428, 258, 1495, 8, 5547, 6943, 7840, 4, 3, 78, 2158, 3206, 1, 3, 4607, 16699, 1398, 369, 3, 258, 4, 1725, 562, 3955, 8, 5682, 7142, 3673, 17, 99, 4, 3, 1528, 1, 256, 2158, 199, 1253, 33741, 1398, 65, 1, 4212, 4421, 29, 3, 571, 15702, 31, 30, 224, 17, 3, 4607, 138, 11, 13979, 4, 1927, 8, 13796, 17, 1546, 1806, 1106, 4, 4607, 1235, 3671, 4, 3674, 145, 1013, 888, 557, 17, 3, 15702, 31, 30, 120, 570, 4607, 178, 242, 46, 74, 1148, 17, 4607, 138, 822, 1248, 6, 3, 1384, 1, 3476, 1928, 19131, 2, 139, 1179, 1821, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 102, 62, 35, 65, 1, 259, 140, 1, 19131, 2, 38551, 38552, 34, 1821, 4, 7, 187, 35, 8775, 532, 1, 102, 62, 553, 77, 138, 631, 1616, 4607, 138, 1322, 6, 40, 991, 6, 571, 15702, 31, 57, 1821, 50, 102, 62, 1882, 55, 1, 4607, 4, 225, 57, 844, 17, 3193, 308, 222, 359, 47, 8, 200, 4, 3, 24, 1, 46, 4015, 1179]",1652.0,17874453,Aggressive Langerhans histiocytosis following T-ALL clonally related neoplasms persistent expression constitutively active NOTCH1,0,0.0
Early peripheral blood blast clearance during induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia predicts superior relapse-free survival.,Blood,Blood,2007-10-01,"In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a rapid decline of circulating leukemic blasts in response to induction chemotherapy or prednisone is one of the most important prognostic factors, not only for achieving remission but also for relapse-free survival (RFS). However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) parameters of chemosensitivity have been restricted mainly to the rapidity of achievement of complete remission (CR) or the assessment of residual leukemic bone marrow blasts during aplasia. We hypothesized that the time to circulating peripheral blood blast clearance, as a potential surrogate for in vivo chemosensitivity, would have prognostic relevance in AML also. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 86 adult patients with AML receiving uniform induction and consolidation chemotherapy, we demonstrate that the time to clearance of circulating blasts during induction chemotherapy is an independent prognostic marker of RFS, superseding other known or established risk factors, including karyotype and number of inductions to achieve CR.",Journal Article,4495.0,50.0,childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia rapid decline circulating leukemic blasts response induction chemotherapy prednisone important prognostic factors achieving remission relapse-free survival RFS acute myeloid leukemia AML parameters chemosensitivity restricted mainly rapidity achievement complete remission CR assessment residual leukemic bone marrow blasts aplasia hypothesized time circulating peripheral blood blast clearance potential surrogate vivo chemosensitivity prognostic relevance AML retrospective cohort 86 adult patients AML receiving uniform induction consolidation chemotherapy demonstrate time clearance circulating blasts induction chemotherapy independent prognostic marker RFS superseding known established risk factors including karyotype number inductions achieve CR,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 8, 1321, 1858, 1, 1033, 2015, 2438, 4, 51, 6, 504, 56, 15, 1979, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 305, 177, 130, 44, 158, 9, 1785, 734, 84, 120, 9, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 137, 4, 286, 533, 329, 1038, 1, 5522, 47, 85, 2016, 2615, 6, 3, 17112, 1, 5088, 1, 236, 734, 684, 15, 3, 455, 1, 753, 2015, 581, 2438, 190, 12307, 21, 1237, 17, 3, 98, 6, 1033, 672, 315, 3112, 1960, 22, 8, 174, 2592, 9, 4, 386, 5522, 688, 47, 177, 2088, 4, 329, 120, 4, 8, 459, 65, 1, 8, 180, 1, 868, 780, 7, 5, 329, 357, 3490, 504, 2, 2173, 56, 21, 608, 17, 3, 98, 6, 1960, 1, 1033, 2438, 190, 504, 56, 16, 35, 306, 177, 952, 1, 1272, 44884, 127, 440, 15, 635, 43, 130, 141, 3385, 2, 207, 1, 34346, 6, 1359, 684]",1020.0,17909077,Early peripheral blood blast clearance induction chemotherapy acute myeloid leukemia predicts superior relapse-free survival,0,0.0
"Childhood central nervous system leukemia: historical perspectives, current therapy, and acute neurological sequelae.",Neuroradiology,Neuroradiology,2007-10-09,"During the past three decades, improvements in the treatment of childhood leukemia have resulted in high cure rates, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unfortunately, successful therapy has come with a price, as significant morbidity can result from neurological affects which harm the brain and spinal cord. The expectation and hope is that chemotherapy, as a primary means of CNS therapy, will result in acceptable disease control with less CNS morbidity than has been observed with combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy over the past several decades. In this review we discuss the poignant, historical aspects of CNS leukemia therapy, outline current methods of systemic and CNS leukemia therapy, and present imaging findings we have encountered in childhood leukemia patients with a variety of acute neurological conditions. A major objective of our research is to understand the neuroimaging correlates of acute and chronic effects of cancer and therapy. Specific features related to CNS leukemia and associated short-term toxicities, both disease- and therapy-related, are emphasized in this review with the specific neuroimaging findings. Specific CNS findings are similarly important when treating acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and details of leukemic involvement and toxicities are also presented in this entity. Despite contemporary treatment approaches which favor the use of chemotherapy (including intrathecal therapy) over radiotherapy in the treatment of CNS leukemia, children still occasionally experience morbid neurotoxicity. Standard neuroimaging is sufficient to identify a variety of neurotoxic sequelae in children, and often suggest specific etiologies. Specific neuroimaging findings frequently indicate a need to alter antileukemia therapy. It is important to appreciate that intrathecal and high doses of systemic chemotherapy are not innocuous and are associated with acute, specific, recognizable, and often serious neurological consequences.",Journal Article,4487.0,38.0,past decades improvements treatment childhood leukemia resulted high cure rates particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia Unfortunately successful therapy come price significant morbidity neurological affects harm brain spinal cord expectation hope chemotherapy primary means CNS therapy acceptable disease control CNS morbidity observed combinations chemotherapy radiotherapy past decades review discuss poignant historical aspects CNS leukemia therapy outline current methods systemic CNS leukemia therapy present imaging findings encountered childhood leukemia patients variety acute neurological conditions major objective research understand neuroimaging correlates acute chronic effects therapy Specific features related CNS leukemia associated short-term toxicities disease- therapy-related emphasized review specific neuroimaging findings Specific CNS findings similarly important treating acute myelogenous leukemia AML details leukemic involvement toxicities presented entity Despite contemporary treatment approaches favor use chemotherapy including intrathecal therapy radiotherapy treatment CNS leukemia children occasionally experience morbid neurotoxicity Standard neuroimaging sufficient identify variety neurotoxic sequelae children suggest specific etiologies Specific neuroimaging findings frequently indicate need alter antileukemia therapy important appreciate intrathecal high doses systemic chemotherapy innocuous associated acute specific recognizable neurological consequences,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[190, 3, 1219, 169, 1968, 1474, 4, 3, 24, 1, 864, 47, 627, 4, 64, 1722, 151, 823, 9, 286, 1275, 62, 3869, 1401, 36, 71, 6235, 5, 8, 8816, 22, 93, 787, 122, 757, 29, 3622, 2561, 92, 7158, 3, 342, 2, 1499, 1885, 3, 9988, 2, 3045, 16, 17, 56, 22, 8, 86, 2263, 1, 1025, 36, 303, 757, 4, 1595, 34, 182, 5, 299, 1025, 787, 76, 71, 85, 164, 5, 1247, 1, 56, 2, 310, 252, 3, 1219, 392, 1968, 4, 26, 206, 21, 1139, 3, 56604, 2252, 2695, 1, 1025, 36, 5277, 291, 636, 1, 403, 2, 1025, 36, 2, 364, 270, 272, 21, 47, 3903, 4, 864, 7, 5, 8, 1362, 1, 286, 3622, 1298, 8, 458, 461, 1, 114, 389, 16, 6, 1640, 3, 7468, 1871, 1, 286, 2, 442, 176, 1, 12, 2, 36, 112, 404, 139, 6, 1025, 2, 41, 978, 337, 385, 110, 34, 2, 36, 139, 32, 8585, 4, 26, 206, 5, 3, 112, 7468, 272, 112, 1025, 272, 32, 1813, 305, 198, 1367, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 3791, 1, 2015, 799, 2, 385, 32, 120, 917, 4, 26, 2983, 550, 2667, 24, 611, 92, 4283, 3, 119, 1, 56, 141, 5126, 36, 252, 310, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1025, 541, 1234, 6319, 730, 8188, 3561, 260, 7468, 16, 1952, 6, 255, 8, 1362, 1, 11148, 4156, 4, 541, 2, 629, 309, 112, 8523, 112, 7468, 272, 746, 1008, 8, 594, 6, 2688, 9169, 36, 192, 16, 305, 6, 19754, 17, 5126, 2, 64, 415, 1, 403, 56, 32, 44, 33576, 2, 32, 41, 5, 286, 112, 13908, 2, 629, 1762, 3622, 3255]",1895.0,17924103,Childhood central nervous leukemia historical perspectives current therapy acute neurological sequelae,65,0.07103825136612021
Dexamethasone alters sleep and fatigue in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-11-01,"Dexamethasone improves the cure rate of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but causes physical and behavioral adverse events. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of dexamethasone exposure on sleep and fatigue in pediatric patients with ALL. One hundred pediatric patients with low-risk or standard-risk ALL were enrolled on 1 of 3 protocols (St. Jude Total XV, Children's Oncology Group [COG] 9904, or COG 9905) at 3 institutions. The mean age of the cohort was 9.24 +/- 3.23 years (range, 5.03-18.14 years). The majority of patients were white (79%) males (62%) with standard-risk ALL (63%). The cohort was divided into 4 subgroups: St. Jude low-risk, St. Jude standard-risk, COG low-risk, and COG standard-risk. Patients wore a wrist actigraph to monitor sleep activity during 2 consecutive 5-day periods: During the first period, they did not receive dexamethasone; and, during the second period, they did. Patients and their parents completed fatigue instruments on Days 2 and 5 of each period, and parents completed sleep diaries. Actual sleep minutes, sleep duration, total daily nap minutes, and fatigue increased significantly during the dexamethasone treatment for 3 to 4 of the subgroups.

Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and untreated patients who were not candidates for chemotherapy were eligible. Of 41 patients, 31 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 3 MDS, 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 chronic myelocytic leukemia. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 200 mg twice daily or 250 mg thrice daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and anorexia and were mild/moderate in severity. Grade 3/4 drug-related adverse experiences included fatigue (27%), thrombocytopenia (12%), and diarrhea (10%). There were no drug-related deaths; 7 patients had hematologic improvement response, including 2 complete responses and 2 complete responses with incomplete blood count recovery (all with AML treated at/below MTD).

Between 1996 and 2000, 164 children with standard-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 95-01 were randomly assigned to receive either 18 Gy CRT delivered in twice daily fractions (0.9 [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] Gy) with double IT therapy (methotrexate and cytarabine) or intensive triple IT drug (methotrexate, cytarabine and hydrocortisone) without CRT. Neuropsychological testing was completed at a median 6 years postdiagnosis for 79 children (CRT, n = 39; triple IT, n = 40), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. Cognitive function for both groups was solidly in the average range, with no consistent group differences in basic cognitive skills. Children treated on the CRT plus double IT arm did, however, exhibit less fluent output and were less effective at modulating their behavior by parent report. This randomized trial revealed only subtle differences 6 years after diagnosis between children who received CNS therapy as CRT plus double IT drug or as intensive triple IT drug.

High-performance liquid chromatography separation of aminopterin-polyglutamates within red blood cells of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,Transl Res,2007-09-07,"Aminopterin (AMT), like the related compound methotrexate (MTX), is a drug with anticancer and antiinflammatory efficacy that works by interfering with synthetic reactions dependent on the vitamin folic acid. Red blood cell (RBC) precursors will accumulate antifolates like AMT and MTX through the same mechanism by which they take up folate. Intracellular folate and antifolates are then metabolized to polyglutamates that remain within the mature RBCs. RBC MTX has been correlated with toxicity and/or treatment efficacy among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or rheumatoid arthritis. Because AMT may offer clinically relevant advantages over MTX, we are testing whether it can be administered safely in multiagent therapy to children with ALL. Total RBC AMT was measured to monitor compliance with this oral, outpatient regimen, and to estimate AMT exposure to the bone marrow. Here we describe methods for quantifying each AMT-polyglutamate species within the RBCs of patients. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 62.5-500 nmol/L. Recovery of individual AMT-polyglutamates ranged from 85% to 92%, and the intraday coefficients of variation were 1.3% to 3.6%. Long-chain AMT-polyglutamates (triglutamate and tetraglutamate forms) accounted for over 40% of intracellular AMT within the RBCs of patients. Patients with long-chain AMT polyglutamate concentrations above the median tended to have lower mean neutrophil counts during weekly AMT therapy, which suggests that RBC AMT polyglutamate accumulation may correlate with hematologic toxicity. As AMT continues to be tested in clinical trials, the methods described here will be useful to define relationships between clinical response to AMT and RBC accumulation of AMT-polyglutamates.",Journal Article,4519.0,3.0,Aminopterin AMT like related compound methotrexate MTX drug anticancer antiinflammatory efficacy works interfering synthetic reactions dependent vitamin folic acid Red blood RBC precursors accumulate antifolates like AMT MTX mechanism folate Intracellular folate antifolates metabolized polyglutamates remain mature RBCs RBC MTX correlated toxicity and/or treatment efficacy patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia rheumatoid arthritis AMT offer clinically relevant advantages MTX testing administered safely multiagent therapy children Total RBC AMT measured monitor compliance oral outpatient regimen estimate AMT exposure bone marrow methods quantifying AMT-polyglutamate species RBCs patients linear concentration range 62.5-500 nmol/L Recovery individual AMT-polyglutamates ranged 85 92 intraday coefficients variation 1.3 3.6 Long-chain AMT-polyglutamates triglutamate tetraglutamate forms accounted 40 intracellular AMT RBCs patients Patients long-chain AMT polyglutamate concentrations median tended lower mean neutrophil counts weekly AMT therapy suggests RBC AMT polyglutamate accumulation correlate hematologic toxicity AMT continues tested clinical trials methods described useful define relationships clinical response AMT RBC accumulation AMT-polyglutamates,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[16421, 5383, 733, 3, 139, 2823, 2116, 3453, 16, 8, 234, 5, 1475, 2, 16754, 209, 17, 10275, 20, 3449, 5, 3273, 2428, 470, 23, 3, 1610, 7853, 971, 3422, 315, 31, 7256, 4881, 303, 7859, 14893, 733, 5383, 2, 3453, 298, 3, 827, 670, 20, 92, 491, 3585, 126, 3100, 2087, 3100, 2, 14893, 32, 818, 10523, 6, 16243, 17, 918, 262, 3, 2908, 15859, 7256, 3453, 71, 85, 438, 5, 155, 2, 15, 24, 209, 107, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 15, 12269, 8646, 408, 5383, 68, 1918, 505, 867, 3126, 252, 3453, 21, 32, 471, 317, 192, 122, 40, 468, 2268, 4, 7148, 36, 6, 541, 5, 62, 181, 7256, 5383, 10, 644, 6, 3334, 3336, 5, 26, 518, 2379, 477, 2, 6, 1191, 5383, 645, 6, 3, 581, 467, 21, 897, 636, 9, 6602, 296, 5383, 22006, 2915, 262, 3, 15859, 1, 7, 3, 719, 10, 1646, 252, 8, 1227, 184, 1, 744, 33, 1666, 4694, 805, 1602, 1, 797, 5383, 16243, 1869, 29, 772, 6, 937, 2, 3, 56667, 5161, 1, 1380, 11, 14, 27, 6, 27, 49, 319, 1260, 5383, 16243, 56668, 2, 56669, 2377, 3688, 9, 252, 327, 1, 2087, 5383, 262, 3, 15859, 1, 7, 7, 5, 319, 1260, 5383, 22006, 1003, 2090, 3, 52, 3886, 6, 47, 280, 313, 2595, 1911, 190, 709, 5383, 36, 92, 844, 17, 7256, 5383, 22006, 1835, 68, 1513, 5, 813, 155, 22, 5383, 2274, 6, 40, 650, 4, 38, 143, 3, 636, 1027, 467, 303, 40, 999, 6, 1107, 2467, 59, 38, 51, 6, 5383, 2, 7256, 1835, 1, 5383, 16243]",1722.0,18022599,High-performance liquid chromatography separation aminopterin-polyglutamates red blood children treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia,741,0.8098360655737705
Valganciclovir prevents cytomegalovirus reactivation in patients receiving alemtuzumab-based therapy.,Blood,Blood,2007-11-26,"Alemtuzumab is an immunosuppressive antibody that depletes normal T cells and B cells. Prophylaxis for herpes virus and Pneumocystis carinii is standard with this agent. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients will experience cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. We conducted a randomized trial wherein patients being treated with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen received prophylaxis with either valaciclovir 500 mg orally daily or valganciclovir 450 mg orally twice daily. The study design planned to enroll 128 patients, but stopping rules for early termination were met. Forty patients were evaluable. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-83 years); median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10). Diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3), hairy cell leukemia (1), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (1), marginal zone leukemia (1), large granular lymphocyte leukemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), and T-cell lymphoma (2). Patients received various alemtuzumab-containing regimens, including single agent (5) or combined with: rituximab (2), pentostatin (6), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (23), or fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) (4).

"In adults with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the greatest benefit is achieved from a matched sibling allogeneic transplantation in first complete remission, and an autologous transplantation is less effective than conventional consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy in all patients: final results of the International ALL Trial (MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993).",Blood,Blood,2007-11-29,"An international collaboration was set up to prospectively evaluate the role of allogeneic transplantation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and compare autologous transplantation with standard chemotherapy. Patients received 2 phases of induction and, if in remission, were assigned to allogeneic transplantation if they had a compatible sibling donor. Other patients were randomized to chemotherapy for 2.5 years versus an autologous transplantation. A donor versus no-donor analysis showed that Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients with a donor had a 5-year improved overall survival (OS), 53% versus 45% (P = .01), and the relapse rate was significantly lower (P < or = .001). The survival difference was significant in standard-risk patients, but not in high-risk patients with a high nonrelapse mortality rate in the high-risk donor group. Patients randomized to chemotherapy had a higher 5-year OS (46%) than those randomized to autologous transplantation (37%; P = .03). Matched related allogeneic transplantations for ALL in first complete remission provide the most potent antileukemic therapy and considerable survival benefit for standard-risk patients. However, the transplantation-related mortality for high-risk older patients was unacceptably high and abrogated the reduction in relapse risk.

MicroRNA expression signatures accurately discriminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia from acute myeloid leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2007-12-04,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, whereas acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. In general, ALL has a better prognosis than AML. To understand the distinct mechanisms in leukemogenesis between ALL and AML and to identify markers for diagnosis and treatment, we performed a large-scale genome-wide microRNA (miRNA, miR) expression profiling assay and identified 27 miRNAs that are differentially expressed between ALL and AML. Among them, miR-128a and -128b are significantly overexpressed, whereas let-7b and miR-223 are significantly down-regulated in ALL compared with AML. They are the most discriminatory miRNAs between ALL and AML. Using the expression signatures of a minimum of two of these miRNAs resulted in an accuracy rate of >95% in the diagnosis of ALL and AML. The differential expression patterns of these four miRNAs were validated further through large-scale real-time PCR on 98 acute leukemia samples covering most of the common cytogenetic subtypes, along with 10 normal control samples. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-128 in ALL was at least partly associated with promoter hypomethylation and not with an amplification of its genomic locus. Taken together, we showed that expression signatures of as few as two miRNAs could accurately discriminate ALL from AML, and that epigenetic regulation might play an important role in the regulation of expression of miRNAs in acute leukemias.",Journal Article,4431.0,350.0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia common childhood acute myeloid leukemia AML common acute leukemia adults general better prognosis AML understand distinct mechanisms leukemogenesis AML identify markers diagnosis treatment performed large-scale genome-wide microRNA miRNA miR expression profiling identified 27 miRNAs differentially expressed AML miR-128a -128b significantly overexpressed let-7b miR-223 significantly down-regulated compared AML discriminatory miRNAs AML expression signatures minimum miRNAs resulted accuracy rate 95 diagnosis AML differential expression patterns miRNAs validated large-scale real-time PCR 98 acute leukemia covering common cytogenetic subtypes 10 normal control Furthermore overexpression miR-128 partly associated promoter hypomethylation amplification genomic locus Taken showed expression signatures miRNAs accurately discriminate AML epigenetic regulation play important role regulation expression miRNAs acute leukemias,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 1275, 62, 16, 3, 96, 186, 864, 12, 547, 286, 533, 329, 16, 3, 96, 186, 286, 4, 857, 4, 1083, 62, 71, 8, 380, 356, 76, 329, 6, 1640, 3, 834, 483, 4, 5661, 59, 62, 2, 329, 2, 6, 255, 525, 9, 147, 2, 24, 21, 173, 8, 375, 1124, 898, 1019, 3213, 2053, 722, 55, 1080, 719, 2, 108, 428, 2028, 17, 32, 2478, 570, 59, 62, 2, 329, 107, 1370, 722, 56725, 2, 56726, 32, 97, 1711, 547, 4642, 16856, 2, 722, 3907, 32, 97, 1328, 1065, 4, 62, 72, 5, 329, 491, 32, 3, 96, 7276, 2028, 59, 62, 2, 329, 75, 3, 55, 2210, 1, 8, 2499, 1, 100, 1, 46, 2028, 627, 4, 35, 1190, 116, 1, 48, 4, 3, 147, 1, 62, 2, 329, 3, 1777, 55, 764, 1, 46, 294, 2028, 11, 938, 195, 298, 375, 1124, 1589, 98, 604, 23, 1096, 286, 347, 9296, 96, 1, 3, 186, 1266, 814, 1510, 5, 79, 295, 182, 347, 798, 21, 204, 17, 851, 1, 722, 3990, 4, 62, 10, 28, 506, 5180, 41, 5, 973, 4441, 2, 44, 5, 35, 1073, 1, 211, 572, 2474, 1633, 1162, 21, 224, 17, 55, 2210, 1, 22, 1021, 22, 100, 2028, 359, 2141, 5696, 62, 29, 329, 2, 17, 1418, 863, 822, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 3, 863, 1, 55, 1, 2028, 4, 286, 2792]",1433.0,18056805,MicroRNA expression signatures accurately discriminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia,17,0.018579234972677595
BCL-2 dependence and ABT-737 sensitivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2007-12-04,"Cancer cells acquire disruptions in normal signal transduction pathways and homeostatic mechanisms that would trigger apoptosis in normal cells. These abnormalities include genomic instability, oncogene activation, and growth factor independent proliferation. Therefore, cancer cells likely require a block in apoptosis in order to survive. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 provides a block in apoptosis that is frequently observed in cancer cells. We have developed methods for the detection and analysis of BCL-2 dependence and here apply them to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BH3 profiling, a mitochondrial assay that classifies blocks in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, indicated a dependence on BCL-2 of both ALL cell lines and primary samples. This dependence predicted that BCL-2 would be complexed with select pro-death BH3 family proteins, a prediction confirmed by the isolation of BCL-2 complexes with BIM. Furthermore, the BH3 profiling and protein analysis predicted that ALL cell lines and primary cells would be sensitive to ABT-737 as a single agent. Finally, BH3 profiling and protein studies accurately predicted a relative degree of sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonism in cell lines. The ALL cells studied exhibit BCL-2 dependence, supporting clinical trials of BCL-2 antagonists in ALL as single agents or combination therapies.",Journal Article,4431.0,147.0,acquire disruptions normal signal transduction pathways homeostatic mechanisms trigger apoptosis normal abnormalities include genomic instability oncogene activation growth factor independent proliferation likely require block apoptosis order survive Overexpression antiapoptotic BCL-2 provides block apoptosis frequently observed developed methods detection BCL-2 dependence apply acute lymphoblastic leukemia BH3 profiling mitochondrial classifies blocks intrinsic apoptotic pathway indicated dependence BCL-2 lines primary dependence predicted BCL-2 complexed select pro-death BH3 family prediction confirmed isolation BCL-2 complexes BIM Furthermore BH3 profiling predicted lines primary sensitive ABT-737 single agent Finally BH3 profiling studies accurately predicted relative degree sensitivity BCL-2 antagonism lines studied exhibit BCL-2 dependence supporting clinical trials BCL-2 antagonists single agents combination therapies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 37, 6206, 11594, 4, 295, 1235, 2761, 460, 2, 11334, 483, 17, 688, 5781, 351, 4, 295, 37, 46, 1171, 643, 572, 1753, 1836, 363, 2, 129, 161, 306, 457, 673, 12, 37, 322, 1353, 8, 2381, 4, 351, 4, 1732, 6, 4573, 851, 1, 3, 4176, 178, 1044, 18, 777, 8, 2381, 4, 351, 17, 16, 746, 164, 4, 12, 37, 21, 47, 276, 636, 9, 3, 638, 2, 65, 1, 1044, 18, 3721, 2, 467, 4930, 1370, 6, 286, 1275, 62, 5486, 1080, 8, 2019, 719, 17, 15295, 2860, 4, 3, 2354, 1631, 308, 1103, 8, 3721, 23, 1044, 18, 1, 110, 62, 31, 285, 2, 86, 347, 26, 3721, 783, 17, 1044, 18, 688, 40, 17102, 5, 1717, 1805, 273, 5486, 607, 652, 8, 1590, 557, 20, 3, 5019, 1, 1044, 18, 3817, 5, 3595, 798, 3, 5486, 1080, 2, 178, 65, 783, 17, 62, 31, 285, 2, 86, 37, 688, 40, 745, 6, 3095, 4933, 22, 8, 226, 420, 1368, 5486, 1080, 2, 178, 94, 2141, 783, 8, 580, 1444, 1, 485, 6, 1044, 18, 7537, 4, 31, 285, 3, 62, 37, 656, 2239, 1044, 18, 3721, 1912, 38, 143, 1, 1044, 18, 4444, 4, 62, 22, 226, 183, 15, 150, 235]",1338.0,18056841,BCL-2 dependence ABT-737 sensitivity acute lymphoblastic leukemia,149,0.1628415300546448
SOS1 mutations are rare in human malignancies: implications for Noonan Syndrome patients.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2008-03-01,"Germ line gain-of-function mutations in several members of the RAS/ERK pathway, including PTPN11, KRAS, and RAF1, cause the autosomal dominant genetic disorder Noonan Syndrome (NS). NS patients are at increased risk of leukemia/myeloproliferative disease and possibly some solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma. Recently, SOS1 gain of function mutations have also been shown to cause NS. Somatic PTPN11, KRAS, and RAF1 mutations occur (although at different frequencies) in a variety of sporadic neoplasms, but whether SOS1 mutations are associated with human cancer has not been evaluated. We sequenced DNA from a total of 810 primary malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, breast, and colon carcinomas, and acute myelogenous leukemia, as well as several neuroblastoma cell lines. From this large, diverse series, missense SOS1 mutations were identified in a single pancreatic tumor, one lung adenocarcinoma, and a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Our findings suggest that SOS1 is not a significant human oncogene in most cancers.

Alu elements mediate MYB gene tandem duplication in human T-ALL.,The Journal of experimental medicine,J. Exp. Med.,2007-12-10,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the MYB oncogene is frequently duplicated in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We find that the human MYB locus is flanked by 257-bp Alu repeats and that the duplication is mediated somatically by homologous recombination between the flanking Alu elements on sister chromatids. Nested long-range PCR analysis indicated a low frequency of homologous recombination leading to MYB tandem duplication in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of approximately 50% of healthy individuals, none of whom had a MYB duplication in the germline.

Oncol.,2007-12-01,"The search for more effective and safer anti-leukemia therapies has led to the identification of several new agents that show activity against specific types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recently, three novel purine nucleoside analogues (nelarabine, clofarabine, and forodesine) have shown promising activity in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Of these, nelarabine has shown clinically meaningful benefit in patients with T-cell ALL, with overall response rates ranging from 33% to 60%, the induction of durable complete remissions, and an overall 1-year survival rate of 28% in adults. Clofarabine has also shown promising clinical activity in pediatric patients, with an overall response rate of 30%, and some patients are able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Forodesine is the most recent novel agent, with a unique mechanism that has shown single-agent activity in relapsed and refractory T- and B-cell leukemias and cutaneous lymphomas.

Impact of cytogenetics on the outcome of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of Southwest Oncology Group 9400 study.,Blood,Blood,2007-12-21,"We examined the prognostic impact of cytogenetics on the outcome of 200 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients 15 to 65 years of age enrolled in Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)-9400 study. Evaluable cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization studies were available in 140 (70%) patients. Four karyotype categories (normal [n = 31, 22%], t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 [n = 36, 26%], other unfavorable [-7, +8, or 11q23 rearrangement, n = 19, 13%], and miscellaneous [n = 54, 39%]) and the biologically and clinically relevant ALL ploidy subgroups were prospectively defined. Overall survival (OS) decreased significantly with increasing age (P = .009) and varied with karyotype category (P < .001). OS was worst for t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 followed by other unfavorable karyotypes, with hazard ratios (HR) of 3.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.88-6.31) and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.04-4.04), respectively, compared with normal diploid group. OS of the miscellaneous group was similar to that of the normal diploid group (HR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.44-1.53). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was not significantly associated with age (P = .30) but was heterogeneous among karyotype categories (P < .001) primarily because of poor RFS in t(9;22)/BCR/ABL1 (HR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.80-6.75) compared with the normal diploid group.

"Relationships among severity of osteonecrosis, pain, range of motion, and functional mobility in children, adolescents, and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Physical therapy,Phys Ther,2008-01-17,"Up to 38% of children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develop osteonecrosis, often without symptoms. Little is known about the association between the degree of osteonecrosis and functional mobility in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among the degree of osteonecrosis, pain, range of motion (ROM), and functional mobility in people with ALL. Thirty-three subjects aged 5 to 27 years with ALL and osteonecrosis participated. The extent of osteonecrosis was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip and knee according to 2 classification systems, including the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) and a knee staging scale. Pain, hip and knee ROM, and the Timed Up and Down Stairs (TUDS) Test were used as measures.

We reviewed risk factors and clinical consequences of DKA in patients undergoing therapy for ALL at SJCRH between 1991 and 2006. DKA occurred in 6 of 797 evaluable patients. Only older age at diagnosis of ALL was a risk factor for DKA. Four of six patients with DKA as compared to 232 of the other 791 patients were older than 10 years (P = 0.03). Race, sex, body mass index, leukemia immunophenotype, ALL risk category, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and treatment protocol were not associated with DKA. All patients were managed with intravenous fluids, dietary modification, and short-term use of insulin. Patients were hospitalized for 4-12 days, with a median ICU stay of 1 day. In two patients, correction of hyperglycemia was too rapid, and two others experienced hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy. There were no permanent complications of DKA or its treatment. No patient required long-term insulin use. No patient had recurrent DKA; only one of the six patients had a subsequent hyperglycemia episode. All six patients are alive in remission 6-13 years after diagnosis.

Absence of secondary malignant neoplasms in children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with dexrazoxane.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-03-01,"Dexrazoxane is a drug used to prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. A recent report found an association between the use of dexrazoxane and the risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in children with Hodgkin's disease. We report the absence of an association of SMNs in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 95-01. Two hundred five children with high-risk (HR) ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (n = 100) or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane (n = 105) during the induction and intensification phases of multiagent chemotherapy. We compared incidence of SMNs in these two groups. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, no differences in the incidence of SMNs were noted between the group that received dexrazoxane and the group that did not (P = .66). One SMN (a melanoma located outside of the cranial radiation field) occurred in a patient who was randomly assigned to doxorubicin alone. No SMNs were observed in patients randomly assigned to receive dexrazoxane. Dexrazoxane was not associated with an increased risk of SMNs in children treated for HR ALL.

Patients received topotecan (2.4 mg/m(2) daily as a 30-minute infusion) for 5 days before induction therapy with dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase (native or pegylated Escherichia coli). The pharmacokinetics of topotecan were measured with the first dose of treatment in 23 patients. Twenty-eight of 31 patients with circulating blast cells were evaluable for response to topotecan. Twenty-five patients (89.3%) had a response (>25% decrease in circulating blast cells). The leukocyte count (P = .0001) and blast cell count (P = .0009) declined significantly during topotecan therapy. The median (range) topotecan lactone area under the concentration-time curve after the first dose was 85.4 L/hour/m(2) (range, 38.7-229.3 L/hour/m(2)). At the end of induction, 23 patients (74.2%) had a complete response, 1 patient (3.2%) had a partial response, 5 patients (16.1%) had no response, and 2 patients had died of infection. Six of the 17 patients who were studied for minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved MRD-negative status at the end of induction. The main toxicities were hematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic. The estimated 5-year survival rate, event-free survival rate, and cumulative incidence of second relapse were 24.1% +/- 7.9%, 18.2% +/- 7.4%, and 22.8% +/- 8.7%, respectively, in the 29 patients who had a hematologic first relapse.

Twenty-five-year follow-up among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Blood,Blood,2008-03-11,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for late effects of cancer therapy. Five-year ALL survivors (< 21 years at diagnosis; n = 5760 eligible, 4151 participants), diagnosed from 1970 to 1986 were compared with the general population and a sibling cohort (n = 3899). Cumulative mortality of 5760 5-year survivors was 13% at 25 years from diagnosis. Recurrent ALL (n = 483) and second neoplasms (SNs; n = 89) were the major causes of death. Among 185 survivors, 199 SNs occurred, 53% in the CNS. Survivors reported more multiple chronic medical conditions (CMCs; odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.4-3.2) and severe or life-threatening CMCs (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3.0-4.5) than siblings. Cumulative incidence of severe CMCs, including death, 25 years from diagnosis was 21.3% (95% CI, 18.2-24.4; 23.3% [95% CI, 19.4-27.2] and 13.4% [95% CI, 8.4-18.4] for irradiated and nonirradiated survivors, respectively). Survivors reported more adverse general and mental health, functional impairment, and activity limitations compared with siblings (P < .001).

A total of 50% had a white blood cell count (WBC) more than 30 x 10(9)/L, 18% extramedullary disease, 42% achieved CR more than 8 weeks from diagnosis, 25% had adverse cytogenetics, and 19% had T-cell leukemia. A total of 41% were HLA well-matched, 41% partially matched with their donors, and 18% were HLA-mismatched. At 54-month median follow-up, incidences of acute grade 2-IV, III to IV, and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 50%, 25%, and 43%, respectively. Five-year treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, and overall survival were 42%, 20%, and 39%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, TRM was significantly higher with HLA-mismatched donors and T-cell depletion. Relapse risk was higher if the diagnostic WBC was more than 100 x 10(9)/L. Factors associated with poorer survival included WBC more than 100 x 10(9)/L, more than 8 weeks to CR1, cytomegalovirus seropositivity, HLA mismatching, and T-cell depletion.

In vivo response to methotrexate forecasts outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and has a distinct gene expression profile.,PLoS medicine,PLoS Med.,2008-04-01,"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children, and can now be cured in approximately 80% of patients. Nevertheless, drug resistance is the major cause of treatment failure in children with ALL. The drug methotrexate (MTX), which is widely used to treat many human cancers, is used in essentially all treatment protocols worldwide for newly diagnosed ALL. Although MTX has been extensively studied for many years, relatively little is known about mechanisms of de novo resistance in primary cancer cells, including leukemia cells. This lack of knowledge is due in part to the fact that existing in vitro methods are not sufficiently reliable to permit assessment of MTX resistance in primary ALL cells. Therefore, we measured the in vivo antileukemic effects of MTX and identified genes whose expression differed significantly in patients with a good versus poor response to MTX. We utilized measures of decreased circulating leukemia cells of 293 newly diagnosed children after initial ""up-front"" in vivo MTX treatment (1 g/m(2)) to elucidate interpatient differences in the antileukemic effects of MTX. To identify genomic determinants of these effects, we performed a genome-wide assessment of gene expression in primary ALL cells from 161 of these newly diagnosed children (1-18 y). We identified 48 genes and two cDNA clones whose expression was significantly related to the reduction of circulating leukemia cells after initial in vivo treatment with MTX. This finding was validated in an independent cohort of children with ALL. Furthermore, this measure of initial MTX in vivo response and the associated gene expression pattern were predictive of long-term disease-free survival (p < 0.001, p = 0.02). Together, these data provide new insights into the genomic basis of MTX resistance and interpatient differences in MTX response, pointing to new strategies to overcome MTX resistance in childhood ALL.

Asparaginase may influence dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-04-01,"Dexamethasone is used widely in oncology, but pharmacokinetic studies are lacking. We evaluated dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We assessed 214 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received 418 courses of oral dexamethasone (8 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 and 8 of reinduction. Extensive asparaginase use preceded reinduction in the 101 children in the standard/high-risk treatment arm but not in the 113 children in the low-risk treatment arm. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and disposition was fit to dexamethasone plasma concentrations by using maximum a posteriori probability estimation; we evaluated covariates by using linear mixed models. Interpatient and intrapatient variabilities in apparent clearance were substantial; they were 46% and 53%, respectively. Variability was explained by the serum albumin concentration (P < .0001), concomitant use of fentanyl (P = .008) and ketoconazole (P = .03), and age (P = .006). Apparent clearance was higher in the low-risk arm (P < .001) and was related to a greater serum albumin concentration (P < .001) and to a lower exposure to asparaginase than in the standard/high-risk arm. Hypoalbuminemia, a biomarker of asparaginase activity, was associated with a lower dexamethasone apparent clearance (P = .04) in patients in the standard/high-risk arm that was more pronounced in those not allergic to asparaginase.

Clin. Oncol.,2008-05-01,"To prospectively determine the prognostic significance of the TEL-AML1 fusion in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). TEL gene status was determined for 926 patients with B-precursor ALL enrolled on the Pediatric Oncology Group ALinC 16 trials and patients were observed for a median time of 8 years. Rearrangements of the TEL gene were detected in 244 patients (26%). The estimated 5-year event-free survival rate (+/- SE) for patients with TEL rearrangements was 86% +/- 2%, compared with 72% +/- 2% for those with germline TEL (P < .0001). TEL rearrangements were associated with a superior outcome among patients with standard-risk ALL, high-risk ALL, and rapid early responses to therapy. In a multivariate analysis that included risk group, sex, and day 15 marrow status, TEL status was an independent predictor of outcome (P = .0002).

Concordant gene expression in leukemia cells and normal leukocytes is associated with germline cis-SNPs.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2008-05-14,"The degree to which gene expression covaries between different primary tissues within an individual is not well defined. We hypothesized that expression that is concordant across tissues is more likely influenced by genetic variability than gene expression which is discordant between tissues. We quantified expression of 11,873 genes in paired samples of primary leukemia cells and normal leukocytes from 92 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Genetic variation at >500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was also assessed. The expression of only 176/11,783 (1.5%) genes was correlated (p<0.008, FDR = 25%) in the two tissue types, but expression of a high proportion (20 of these 176 genes) was significantly related to cis-SNP genotypes (adjusted p<0.05). In an independent set of 134 patients with ALL, 14 of these 20 genes were validated as having expression related to cis-SNPs, as were 9 of 20 genes in a second validation set of HapMap cell lines.

Genetic predictors of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,Pharmacogenet. Genomics,2008-06-01,"Glucocorticoids are used universally in the remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids is hypertension. Our aim was to define the frequency of and clinical and genetic risk factors for steroid-induced hypertension. We determined the genotypes for 203 candidate polymorphisms in genes previously linked to hypertension or to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents. Hypertension was defined according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics; patients were evaluated during the 28-day period of prednisone at 40 mg/m2/day during remission induction of childhood ALL. Of the 602 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were normotensive pretherapy, 270 (45%) developed hypertension during remission induction. None of the putative risk factors (age, sex, race, white blood cell count, risk group, body mass index, or serum creatinine) was associated with hypertension. Among the polymorphisms genotyped, we identified eight genes (CNTNAP2, LEPR, CRHR1, NTAN1, SLC12A3, ALPL, BGLAP, and APOB) containing variants that were associated with hypertension (chi2 P values 0.002-0.048), several of which interact with the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.

What determines the outcomes for adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on cooperative group protocols? A comparison of Children's Cancer Group and Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies.,Blood,Blood,2008-05-23,"We performed a retrospective comparison of presenting features, planned treatment, complete remission (CR) rate, and outcome of 321 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 16 to 20 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated on consecutive trials in either the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) or the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) from 1988 to 2001. CR rates were identical, 90% for both CALGB and CCG AYAs. CCG AYAs had a 63% event-free survival (EFS) and 67% overall survival (OS) at 7 years in contrast to the CALGB AYAs, in which 7-year EFS was only 34% (P < .001; relative hazard rate [RHR] = 2.2) and OS was 46% (P < .001; RHR = 1.9). While CALGB AYAs aged 16 to 17 years achieved similar outcomes to all CCG AYAs with a 7-year EFS of 55%, the EFS for 18- to 20-year-old CALGB patients was only 29%.

Long-term remission of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from matched sibling donors: a 20-year experience with the fractionated total body irradiation-etoposide regimen.,Blood,Blood,2008-06-02,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only known curative modality for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL). Sixty-seven patients with HLA-matched sibling donors received fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and high-dose VP16, whereas 11 patients received FTBI/VP16/cyclophosphamide, and 1 patient received FTBI/VP16/busulfan. The median age was 36 years. At the time of HCT, 49 patients (62%) were in first complete remission (CR1) and 30 patients (38%) were beyond CR1 (> CR1). The median follow-up was 75 months (range, 14-245 months). The 10-year overall survival for the CR1 and beyond CR1 patients was 54% and 29% (P = .01), respectively, and event-free survival was 48% and 26% (P = .02), respectively. There was no significant difference in relapse incidence (28% vs 41%, P = .28), but nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in the beyond CR1 patients, (31% vs 54%, P = .03, respectively). By univariate analysis, factors affecting event-free and overall survival were white blood cell count at diagnosis (< 30 x 10(9)/L vs > 30 x 10(9)/L) and disease status (CR1 vs > CR1). The median time to relapse for CR1 and for beyond CR1 patients was 12 months and 9 months, respectively.

Progress in the treatment of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2008-07-01,"Despite improvements in the achievement of complete remission and progress in the supportive care of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the last decade, the majority of patients have eventually relapsed with overall survival in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia of only 30-40%. However, the recent approach of adapting therapy according to biologic features appears to be resulting in significant progress for specific subsets of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The present review highlights some of these new risk-adapted approaches focusing on recent advances in treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mature B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia using biologically targeted therapies, and new approaches to treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in older adolescents and young adults, adopting therapeutic strategies employed in the successful treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A recent study that examines the role of allogeneic stem cell transplant for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission will also be reviewed. The subset-specific approach to therapy of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia is beginning to result in promising improvements in survival.

CRHR1 polymorphisms predict bone density in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-06-01,"Corticosteroids are a critical component of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but are associated with late effects, such as osteoporosis. Risk factors remain poorly defined. Because CRHR1 polymorphisms have been associated with other corticosteroid effects, our goal was to define whether CRHR1 polymorphisms predict which patients with ALL are likely to develop bone mineral deficits. The mean bone mineral density z scores of 309 long-term survivors of ALL were determined by quantitative computed tomography of the trabecular lumbar spine. We analyzed whether CRHR1 genotypes, adjusted for sex, ALL treatment regimen, and weight, could predict bone density. We found that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with bone density in a sex-specific manner. Bone density was lower in males (P = .001), in nonblack patients (P < .08), in those who were not overweight (P < .001), and in those who received intensive antimetabolites and glucocorticoids (P < .001). After adjustment for these features, the G allele at the rs1876828 SNP was associated with lower z scores (P = .02) in males but tended to have the opposite association in females (P = .09).

Osteonecrosis in adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-06-01,"Osteonecrosis (ON) is a potentially serious complication of therapy in survivors of childhood cancer. Our goals were to describe the incidence of ON and identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with elevated risk. The rate of self-reported ON was determined for 9,261 patients enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with the rate in a random sample of 2,872 siblings of survivors. Survivors with positive responses were reinterviewed to confirm the diagnosis. Fifty-two cancer survivors reported ON in 78 joints, yielding 20-year cumulative incidence of 0.43% and a rate ratio (RR) of 6.2 (95% CI, 2.3 to 17.2) compared with siblings, adjusted for age and sex; 44% developed ON in a previous radiation field. The RR was greatest among survivors of stem-cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (RR = 26.9, 66.5, and 93.1, respectively). Nontransplantation patients with ALL (RR = 6.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 19.4), AML (RR = 11.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 61.2), and bone sarcoma (RR = 7.3; 95% CI, 2.0 to 26.2) were at higher risk for ON. Older age at diagnosis, shorter elapsed time, older treatment era, exposure to dexamethasone (+/- prednisone), and gonadal and nongonadal radiation were independently associated with ON.

Prognostic significance of CD20 expression in adults with de novo precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-08-14,"Immunophenotypic classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has well-recognized prognostic implications. The significance of CD20 expression has been evaluated in childhood precursor B-lineage ALL with conflicting results. We retrospectively analyzed the influence of CD20 expression on outcome in 253 adults with de novo precursor B-lineage ALL treated with either conventional (VAD/CVAD) or intensive (hyper-CVAD) frontline chemotherapy regimens in the pre-rituximab era. Overall, CD20 positivity of at least 20% was associated with lower 3-year rates of complete remission duration (CRD; 20% vs 55%, P < .001) and overall survival (OS; 27% vs 40%, p = .03). In the CD20 negative subset, the 3-year rates for CRD (58% vs 42%, p = .04) and OS (60% vs 28%, P < .001) were superior for hyper-CVAD compared with VAD/CVAD; rates were particularly favorable for the CD20 negative younger age group (68% and 85%, respectively). In contrast, 3-year CRD and OS rates were uniformly poor for the CD20-positive group regardless of therapy (27% or less). Multivariate analysis for event-free survival identified older age, leukocyte count higher than 30 x 10(9)/L, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, high systemic risk classification, and CD20 positivity as independent predictors of worse outcome. In conclusion, CD20 expression in de novo adult precursor B-lineage ALL appears to be associated with a poor prognosis.

Genome-wide copy number profiling reveals molecular evolution from diagnosis to relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-09-02,"The underlying pathways that lead to relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. To comprehensively characterize the molecular evolution of relapsed childhood B-precursor ALL, we used human 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 20 diagnosis/relapse pairs relative to germ line. We identified 758 CNAs, 66.4% of which were less than 1 Mb, and deletions outnumbered amplifications by approximately 2.5:1. Although CNAs persisting from diagnosis to relapse were observed in all 20 cases, 17 patients exhibited differential CNA patterns from diagnosis to relapse. Of the 396 CNAs observed in 20 relapse samples, only 69 (17.4%) were novel (absent in the matched diagnosis samples). EBF1 and IKZF1 deletions were particularly frequent in this relapsed ALL cohort (25.0% and 35.0%, respectively), suggesting their role in disease recurrence.

Image-guided total-marrow irradiation using helical tomotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma and acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2008-09-09,"Total-body irradiation (TBI) has an important role in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but is associated with significant toxicities. Targeted TBI using helical tomotherapy results in reduced doses to normal organs, which predicts for reduced toxicities compared with standard TBI. Thirteen patients with multiple myeloma were treated in an autologous tandem transplantation Phase I trial with high-dose melphalan, followed 6 weeks later by total-marrow irradiation (TMI) to skeletal bone. Dose levels were 10, 12, 14, and 16 Gy at 2 Gy daily/twice daily. In a separate allogeneic HCT trial, 8 patients (5 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 1 with multiple myeloma) were treated with TMI plus total lymphoid irradiation plus splenic radiotherapy to 12 Gy (1.5 Gy twice daily) combined with fludarabine/melphalan. For the 13 patients in the tandem autologous HCT trial, median age was 54 years (range, 42-66 years). Median organ doses were 15-65% that of the gross target volume dose. Primarily Grades 1-2 acute toxicities were observed. Six patients reported no vomiting; 9 patients, no mucositis; 6 patients, no fatigue; and 8 patients, no diarrhea. For the 8 patients in the allogeneic HCT trial, median age was 52 years (range, 24-61 years). Grades 2-3 nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and diarrhea were observed. In both trials, no Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity was observed, and all patients underwent successful engraftment. This study shows that TMI using helical tomotherapy is clinically feasible. The reduced acute toxicities observed compare favorably with those seen with standard TBI.

Cutaneous precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in 2 adult patients: clinicopathologic and molecular cytogenetic studies with a review of the literature.,Archives of dermatology,Arch Dermatol,2008-09-01,"Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL) is an uncommon high-grade neoplasm of immature B cells. In contrast to the more common lymphoblastic lymphoma of T-cell lineage, B-LBL can be an extranodal disease, with a propensity to involve skin and bone. Most reported cases of B-LBL in the skin, a rarity in adults, are manifestations of existing systemic disease. We report 2 unusual cases of primary cutaneous B-LBL in adults. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, not previously reported in primary cutaneous B-LBL to our knowledge, demonstrated rearrangement of the MLL gene in one patient and possible hyperdiploidy in the other, both reported in precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Review of the literature identified 13 reported cases of B-LBL occurring primarily in the skin, in addition to our 2 cases. Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma is more common in children and in young adults, with a tropism for the head and neck region. Histologically, B-LBL must be differentiated from other high-grade lymphoid tumors and small ""blue round cell"" tumors. Because of the common absence of mature B-cell markers in immunohistochemical studies and the frequent expression of CD99, B-LBL may present a diagnostic challenge. Although there is a suggestion in a limited number of patients that abbreviated therapy may provide long-term disease control, the risk of relapse remains significant, particularly if a patient's condition is misdiagnosed and the patient is treated as having mature B-cell lymphoma. In the absence of prospective studies for this population, patients with B-LBL are treated currently with intensive acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens.",Case Reports,4159.0,35.0,Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma B-LBL uncommon high-grade neoplasm immature B contrast common lymphoblastic lymphoma T-cell lineage B-LBL extranodal disease propensity involve skin bone reported cases B-LBL skin rarity adults manifestations existing systemic disease report 2 unusual cases primary cutaneous B-LBL adults Fluorescence situ hybridization studies previously reported primary cutaneous B-LBL knowledge demonstrated rearrangement MLL patient possible hyperdiploidy reported precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia Review literature identified 13 reported cases B-LBL occurring primarily skin addition 2 cases Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma common children young adults tropism head neck region Histologically B-LBL differentiated high-grade lymphoid small `` blue round '' common absence mature B-cell markers immunohistochemical studies frequent expression CD99 B-LBL present diagnostic challenge suggestion limited number patients abbreviated therapy provide long-term disease control risk relapse remains significant particularly patient 's condition misdiagnosed patient treated mature B-cell lymphoma absence prospective studies population patients B-LBL treated currently intensive acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2765, 132, 31, 1275, 132, 8315, 16, 35, 2052, 64, 88, 2131, 1, 5733, 132, 37, 4, 748, 6, 3, 80, 186, 1275, 1, 102, 31, 2542, 132, 8315, 122, 40, 35, 4093, 34, 5, 8, 1925, 6, 3882, 2, 96, 210, 140, 1, 132, 8315, 4, 3, 8, 4989, 4, 857, 32, 4282, 1, 1692, 403, 34, 21, 414, 18, 4015, 140, 1, 86, 1486, 132, 8315, 4, 857, 1591, 4, 957, 1554, 94, 44, 373, 210, 4, 86, 1486, 132, 8315, 6, 114, 922, 264, 2675, 1, 3, 3049, 145, 4, 104, 69, 2, 899, 11299, 4, 3, 127, 110, 210, 4, 2765, 286, 1275, 206, 1, 3, 789, 108, 233, 210, 140, 1, 132, 8315, 1821, 1561, 4, 3, 4, 352, 6, 114, 18, 140, 2765, 132, 31, 1275, 16, 80, 186, 4, 541, 2, 4, 1169, 857, 5, 8, 9237, 9, 3, 718, 2, 1053, 2161, 132, 8315, 1642, 40, 1442, 29, 127, 64, 88, 2303, 57, 2, 302, 3352, 4436, 31, 522, 57, 408, 1, 3, 186, 1127, 1, 2908, 132, 31, 525, 4, 1382, 94, 2, 3, 908, 55, 1, 13940, 132, 8315, 68, 364, 8, 752, 1745, 242, 125, 16, 8, 8634, 4, 8, 383, 207, 1, 7, 17, 9786, 36, 68, 377, 319, 337, 34, 182, 3, 43, 1, 429, 469, 93, 823, 492, 8, 69, 292, 2850, 16, 10688, 2, 3, 69, 16, 73, 22, 1041, 2908, 132, 31, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 482, 94, 9, 26, 266, 7, 5, 132, 8315, 32, 73, 694, 5, 1686, 286, 1275, 472]",1578.0,18794461,Cutaneous precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma 2 adult patients clinicopathologic molecular cytogenetic studies review literature,3,0.003278688524590164

Inhibition of glycolysis modulates prednisolone resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,Blood,Blood,2008-10-31,"Treatment failure in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is related to cellular resistance to glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone). Recently, we demonstrated that genes associated with glucose metabolism are differentially expressed between prednisolone-sensitive and prednisolone-resistant precursor B-lineage leukemic patients. Here, we show that prednisolone resistance is associated with increased glucose consumption and that inhibition of glycolysis sensitizes prednisolone-resistant ALL cell lines to glucocorticoids. Treatment of prednisolone-resistant Jurkat and Molt4 cells with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), lonidamine (LND), or 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) increased the in vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoids, while treatment of the prednisolone-sensitive cell lines Tom-1 and RS4; 11 did not influence drug cytotoxicity. This sensitizing effect of the glycolysis inhibitors in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cells was not found for other classes of antileukemic drugs (ie, vincristine and daunorubicin). Moreover, down-regulation of the expression of GAPDH by RNA interference also sensitized to prednisolone, comparable with treatment with glycolytic inhibitors. Importantly, the ability of 2-DG to reverse glucocorticoid resistance was not limited to cell lines, but was also observed in isolated primary ALL cells from patients. Together, these findings indicate the importance of the glycolytic pathway in glucocorticoid resistance in ALL and suggest that targeting glycolysis is a viable strategy for modulating prednisolone resistance in ALL.",Journal Article,4099.0,128.0,Treatment failure pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia related cellular resistance glucocorticoids prednisolone Recently demonstrated associated glucose metabolism differentially expressed prednisolone-sensitive prednisolone-resistant precursor B-lineage leukemic patients prednisolone resistance associated increased glucose consumption inhibition glycolysis sensitizes prednisolone-resistant lines glucocorticoids Treatment prednisolone-resistant Jurkat Molt4 2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-DG lonidamine LND 3-bromopyruvate 3-BrPA increased vitro sensitivity glucocorticoids treatment prednisolone-sensitive lines Tom-1 RS4 11 influence drug cytotoxicity sensitizing effect glycolysis inhibitors glucocorticoid-resistant classes antileukemic drugs vincristine daunorubicin down-regulation expression GAPDH RNA interference sensitized prednisolone comparable treatment glycolytic inhibitors Importantly ability 2-DG reverse glucocorticoid resistance limited lines observed isolated primary patients findings indicate importance glycolytic pathway glucocorticoid resistance suggest targeting glycolysis viable strategy modulating prednisolone resistance,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 496, 4, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 16, 139, 6, 763, 251, 6, 7307, 2887, 11253, 761, 21, 264, 17, 214, 41, 5, 2522, 1600, 32, 2478, 570, 59, 11253, 745, 2, 11253, 436, 2765, 132, 2542, 2015, 7, 467, 21, 514, 17, 11253, 251, 16, 41, 5, 101, 2522, 2421, 2, 17, 297, 1, 4484, 6229, 11253, 436, 62, 31, 285, 6, 7307, 24, 1, 11253, 436, 8433, 2, 28410, 37, 5, 18, 6149, 427, 2522, 18, 13746, 57468, 3400, 15, 27, 31367, 27, 14644, 101, 3, 4, 439, 485, 6, 7307, 369, 24, 1, 3, 11253, 745, 31, 285, 57469, 14, 2, 45308, 175, 205, 44, 1054, 234, 1408, 26, 5979, 254, 1, 3, 4484, 222, 4, 5399, 436, 62, 37, 10, 44, 204, 9, 127, 3211, 1, 4512, 600, 2523, 2132, 2, 5247, 1393, 1328, 863, 1, 3, 55, 1, 12271, 20, 893, 3182, 120, 4242, 6, 11253, 1279, 5, 24, 5, 6688, 222, 1859, 3, 801, 1, 18, 13746, 6, 1772, 5399, 251, 10, 44, 383, 6, 31, 285, 84, 10, 120, 164, 4, 1355, 86, 62, 37, 29, 7, 1162, 46, 272, 1008, 3, 1187, 1, 3, 6688, 308, 4, 5399, 251, 4, 62, 2, 309, 17, 529, 4484, 16, 8, 2663, 692, 9, 3712, 11253, 251, 4, 62]",1518.0,18978206,Inhibition glycolysis modulates prednisolone resistance acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Genomic analysis of the clonal origins of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Science,2008-11-01,"Most children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be cured, but the prognosis is dismal for the minority of patients who relapse after treatment. To explore the genetic basis of relapse, we performed genome-wide DNA copy number analyses on matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 61 pediatric patients with ALL. The diagnosis and relapse samples typically showed different patterns of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), with the CNAs acquired at relapse preferentially affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and B cell development. Most relapse samples lacked some of the CNAs present at diagnosis, which suggests that the cells responsible for relapse are ancestral to the primary leukemia cells. Backtracking studies revealed that cells corresponding to the relapse clone were often present as minor subpopulations at diagnosis. These data suggest that genomic abnormalities contributing to ALL relapse are selected for during treatment, and they point to new targets for therapeutic intervention.",Journal Article,4098.0,554.0,children acute lymphoblastic leukemia cured prognosis dismal minority patients relapse treatment explore genetic basis relapse performed genome-wide DNA copy number matched diagnosis relapse 61 pediatric patients diagnosis relapse typically showed different patterns genomic copy number abnormalities CNAs CNAs acquired relapse preferentially affecting implicated cycle regulation B development relapse lacked CNAs present diagnosis suggests responsible relapse ancestral primary leukemia Backtracking studies revealed corresponding relapse clone present minor subpopulations diagnosis suggest genomic abnormalities contributing relapse selected treatment point new targets therapeutic intervention,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[96, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 122, 40, 3733, 84, 3, 356, 16, 3929, 9, 3, 2652, 1, 7, 54, 429, 50, 24, 6, 1645, 3, 336, 877, 1, 429, 21, 173, 898, 1019, 261, 1337, 207, 318, 23, 655, 147, 2, 429, 347, 29, 713, 815, 7, 5, 62, 3, 147, 2, 429, 347, 1969, 224, 338, 764, 1, 572, 1337, 207, 1171, 7452, 5, 3, 7452, 1294, 28, 429, 3509, 2319, 214, 1771, 4, 31, 417, 863, 2, 132, 31, 193, 96, 429, 347, 5005, 476, 1, 3, 7452, 364, 28, 147, 92, 844, 17, 3, 37, 2327, 9, 429, 32, 15165, 6, 3, 86, 37, 57514, 94, 553, 17, 37, 1734, 6, 3, 429, 3910, 11, 629, 364, 22, 2278, 4847, 28, 147, 46, 74, 309, 17, 572, 1171, 3156, 6, 62, 429, 32, 715, 9, 190, 24, 2, 491, 741, 6, 217, 637, 9, 189, 788]",997.0,19039135,Genomic clonal origins relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia,7,0.007650273224043716
Reference alignment of SNP microarray signals for copy number analysis of tumors.,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",Bioinformatics,2008-12-03,"A new procedure to align single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray signals for copy number analysis is proposed. For each individual array, this reference alignment procedure (RAP) uses a set of selected markers as internal references to direct the signal alignment. RAP aligns the signals so that each array has a similar signal distribution among its reference markers. An accompanying reference selection algorithm (RSA) uses genotype calls and initial signal intensities to choose two-copy markers as the internal references for each array. After RSA and RAP are applied, each array has a similar distribution of signals of two-copy markers so that across-array signal comparisons are biologically meaningful. An upper bound for a statistical metric of signal misalignment is derived and provides a theoretical basis to choose RSA-RAP over other alignment procedures for copy number analysis of cancers. In our study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RSA-RAP gives copy number analysis results that show substantially better concordance with cytogenetics than do two other alignment procedures.

Curcumin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of leukemic cells expressing wild-type or T315I-BCR-ABL and prolongs survival of mice with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",Hematology,2008-12-01,"Curcumin, a natural compound derived from tumeric, has been shown to induce apoptosis in the leukemic cell line K562 and other cancer cell lines. However, it is unknown whether curcumin also has an inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL-expressing B-lymphoid cells. We tested whether curcumin has an inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in vitro and in vivo. Pre-B cells isolated from B6 mice expressing wild-type BCR-ABL (B6p210) and T315I mutant (B6T315I) were cultured in serial concentration of curcumin. Cultured cells were analyzed by automated cell counter, flow cytometry, western blotting, and transcription factor arrays. B-ALL was induced by transplantation of MSCV-GFP-p210 transduced donor marrow in lethally irradiated Balb/c mice. Diseased mice were treated with placebo or curcumin until death of the mice. Diseased mice were analyzed by flow cytometric and histopathological analyses. Curcumin inhibited the proliferation of B6p210 and B6T315I cells at concentration as low as 10 muM and induced apoptosis of the cells at concentrations of 30 muM. Using western blots and transcription factors arrays, we showed that curcumin decreased NF-kappaB levels and increased p53 levels.

The graft-versus-leukemia effect using matched unrelated donors is not superior to HLA-identical siblings for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2008-12-04,"Do some patients benefit from an unrelated donor (URD) transplant because of a stronger graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect? We analyzed 4099 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) undergoing a myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from an URD (8/8 human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-matched, n=941) or HLA-identical sibling donor (n=3158) between 1995 and 2004 reported to the CIBMTR. In the Cox regression model, acute and chronic GVHD were added as time-dependent variables. In multivariate analysis, URD transplant recipients had a higher risk for transplantation-related mortality (TRM; relative risk [RR], 2.76; P< .001) and relapse (RR, 1.50; P< .002) in patients with AML, but not ALL or CML. Chronic GVHD was associated with a lower relapse risk in all diagnoses. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was decreased in patients with AML without acute GVHD receiving a URD transplant (RR, 2.02; P< .001) but was comparable to those receiving HLA-identical sibling transplants in patients with ALL and CML. In patients without GVHD, multivariate analysis showed similar risk of relapse but decreased LFS for URD transplants for all 3 diagnoses.

Despite its well-proven clinical efficacy, the use of unmodified Escherichia coli ASP (EC-ASP) has been limited by frequent toxicities, especially the development of hypersensitivity reactions and neutralizing antibodies, and by the need for frequent administration. To overcome these limitations, EC-ASP enzyme was covalently linked to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG), forming the pegylated ASP (PEG-ASP) (Oncaspar). PEG-ASP has a prolonged half-life and is associated with decreased immunogenicity when compared with EC-ASP.

Acquired variation outweighs inherited variation in whole genome analysis of methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation in leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-12-09,"Methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs) determine in vivo efficacy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MTXPG accumulation differs by leukemic subtypes, but genomic determinants of MTXPG variation in ALL remain unclear. We analyzed 3 types of whole genome variation: leukemia cell gene expression and somatic copy number variation, and inherited single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and determined their association with MTXPGs in leukemia cells. Seven genes (FHOD3, IMPA2, ME2, RASSF4, SLC39A6, SMAD2, and SMAD4) displayed all 3 types of genomic variation associated with MTXPGs (P < .05 for gene expression, P < .01 for copy number variation and SNPs): 6 on chromosome 18 and 1 on chromosome 10. Increased chromosome 18 (P = .002) or 10 (P = .036) copy number was associated with MTXPGs even after adjusting for ALL subtype. The expression of the top 7 genes in leukemia cells accounted for more variation in MTXPGs (46%) than did the expression of the top 7 genes in normal HapMap cell lines (20%). The top 7 inherited SNPs in patients accounted for approximately the same degree of variation (17%) in MTXPGs as did the top 7 SNP genotypes in HapMap cell lines (20%).

Cerebrospinal fluid folate, concentrated relative to serum folate prior to therapy, dropped during the first month of therapy and remained below baseline throughout treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine was inversely related to cognitive function prior to treatment. Oral methotrexate was associated with decreased cerebrospinal fluid folate and increased cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine, but these changes were not seen with oral aminopterin. Of 36 patients who had imaging after completion of therapy, 9 had periventricular or subcortical white matter abnormalities consistent with leukoencephalopathy. Peak cerebrospinal fluid tau concentrations during therapy were higher among patients who had leukoencephalopathy after completion of therapy than among those with normal imaging studies at the end of therapy.

Acute leukemia as a secondary malignancy in children and adolescents: current findings and issues.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-01-01,"Secondary acute leukemia is a devastating complication in children and adolescents who have been treated for cancer. Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (s-ALL) was rarely reported previously but can be distinguished today from recurrent primary ALL by comparison of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangement. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) is much more common, and some cases actually may be second primary cancers. Treatment-related and host-related characteristics and their interactions have been identified as risk factors for s-AML. The most widely recognized treatment-related risk factors are alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors (epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines). The magnitude of the risk associated with these factors depends on several variables, including the administration schedule, concomitant medications, and host factors. A high cumulative dose of alkylating agents is well known to predispose to s-AML. The prevalence of alkylator-associated s-AML has diminished among pediatric oncology patients with the reduction of cumulative alkylator dose and limited use of the more leukemogenic alkylators. The best-documented topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated s-AML is s-AML associated with epipodophyllotoxins. The risk of s-AML in these cases is influenced by the schedule of drug administration and by interaction with other antineoplastic agents but is not consistently found to be related to cumulative dose. The unpredictable risk of s-AML after epipodophyllotoxin therapy may discourage the use of these agents, even in patients at a high risk of disease recurrence, although the benefit of recurrence prevention may outweigh the risk of s-AML. Studies in survivors of adult cancers suggest that, contrary to previous beliefs, the outcome of s-AML is not necessarily worse than that of de novo AML when adjusted for cytogenetic features. More studies are needed to confirm this finding in the pediatric patient population.",Journal Article,4037.0,81.0,Secondary acute leukemia devastating complication children adolescents treated Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia s-ALL rarely reported previously distinguished today recurrent primary comparison immunoglobulin T-cell receptor rearrangement Secondary acute myeloid leukemia s-AML common cases actually second primary Treatment-related host-related characteristics interactions identified risk factors s-AML widely recognized treatment-related risk factors alkylating agents topoisomerase II inhibitors epipodophyllotoxins anthracyclines magnitude risk associated factors depends variables including administration schedule concomitant medications host factors high cumulative dose alkylating agents known predispose s-AML prevalence alkylator-associated s-AML diminished pediatric oncology patients reduction cumulative alkylator dose limited use leukemogenic alkylators best-documented topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated s-AML s-AML associated epipodophyllotoxins risk s-AML cases influenced schedule drug administration interaction antineoplastic agents consistently related cumulative dose unpredictable risk s-AML epipodophyllotoxin therapy discourage use agents patients high risk disease recurrence benefit recurrence prevention outweigh risk s-AML Studies survivors adult suggest contrary previous beliefs outcome s-AML necessarily worse novo AML adjusted cytogenetic features studies needed confirm finding pediatric patient population,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[568, 286, 16, 8, 5778, 1447, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 54, 47, 85, 73, 9, 12, 568, 286, 1275, 695, 62, 10, 2416, 210, 373, 84, 122, 40, 4735, 5665, 29, 387, 86, 62, 20, 1155, 1, 2593, 2, 102, 31, 153, 2675, 568, 286, 533, 695, 329, 16, 1802, 80, 186, 2, 476, 140, 6742, 68, 40, 419, 86, 163, 24, 139, 2, 1204, 139, 374, 2, 136, 1286, 47, 85, 108, 22, 43, 130, 9, 695, 329, 3, 96, 1792, 1904, 24, 139, 43, 130, 32, 3410, 183, 2, 3999, 215, 222, 25999, 2, 3597, 3, 3131, 1, 3, 43, 41, 5, 46, 130, 3828, 23, 392, 682, 141, 3, 634, 1055, 1781, 2679, 2, 1204, 130, 8, 64, 967, 61, 1, 3410, 183, 16, 149, 440, 6, 6043, 6, 695, 329, 3, 1078, 1, 9346, 41, 695, 329, 71, 2849, 107, 815, 413, 7, 5, 3, 628, 1, 967, 9346, 61, 2, 383, 119, 1, 3, 80, 13519, 12777, 3, 824, 1405, 3999, 215, 230, 41, 695, 329, 16, 695, 329, 41, 5, 25999, 3, 43, 1, 695, 329, 4, 46, 140, 16, 2574, 20, 3, 1055, 1, 234, 634, 2, 20, 915, 5, 127, 3940, 183, 84, 16, 44, 2433, 204, 6, 40, 139, 6, 967, 61, 3, 8907, 43, 1, 695, 329, 50, 38478, 36, 68, 22513, 3, 119, 1, 46, 183, 871, 4, 7, 28, 8, 64, 43, 1, 34, 146, 242, 3, 247, 1, 146, 1070, 68, 11592, 3, 43, 1, 695, 329, 94, 4, 332, 1, 780, 163, 309, 17, 7194, 6, 698, 5059, 3, 228, 1, 695, 329, 16, 44, 7766, 639, 76, 17, 1, 1566, 2018, 329, 198, 586, 9, 1266, 404, 80, 94, 32, 575, 6, 1843, 26, 1567, 4, 3, 815, 69, 266]",1931.0,19072983,Acute leukemia secondary malignancy children adolescents current findings issues,0,0.0

Hematol.,2009-01-01,"A key goal in cancer research is to identify the total complement of genetic and epigenetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis. We are currently witnessing the rapid evolution and convergence of multiple genome-wide platforms that are making this goal a reality. Leading this effort are studies of the molecular lesions that underlie pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The recent application of microarray-based analyses of DNA copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in pediatric ALL, complemented by transcriptional profiling, resequencing and epigenetic approaches, has identified a high frequency of common genetic alterations in both B-progenitor and T-lineage ALL. These approaches have identified abnormalities in key pathways, including lymphoid differentiation, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, and drug responsiveness. Moreover, the nature and frequency of CNAs differ markedly among ALL genetic subtypes. In this article, we review the key findings from the published data on genome-wide analyses of ALL and highlight some of the technical aspects of data generation and analysis that must be carefully controlled to obtain optimal results.",Journal Article,4037.0,42.0,key goal research identify total complement genetic epigenetic alterations contribute tumorigenesis currently witnessing rapid evolution convergence multiple genome-wide platforms making goal reality Leading effort studies molecular lesions underlie pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia recent application microarray-based DNA copy number abnormalities CNAs pediatric complemented transcriptional profiling resequencing epigenetic approaches identified high frequency common genetic alterations B-progenitor T-lineage approaches identified abnormalities key pathways including lymphoid differentiation cycle regulation suppression drug responsiveness nature frequency CNAs differ markedly genetic subtypes article review key findings published genome-wide highlight technical aspects generation carefully controlled obtain optimal,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 825, 1326, 4, 12, 389, 16, 6, 255, 3, 181, 3731, 1, 336, 2, 1418, 593, 17, 1248, 6, 1565, 21, 32, 694, 34161, 3, 1321, 2554, 2, 12312, 1, 232, 898, 1019, 4364, 17, 32, 1079, 26, 1326, 8, 9265, 1049, 26, 2919, 32, 94, 1, 3, 219, 406, 17, 5875, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 3, 435, 1581, 1, 1727, 90, 318, 1, 261, 1337, 207, 1171, 7452, 4, 815, 62, 13275, 20, 1431, 1080, 11819, 2, 1418, 611, 71, 108, 8, 64, 675, 1, 186, 336, 593, 4, 110, 132, 2520, 2, 102, 2542, 62, 46, 611, 47, 108, 1171, 4, 825, 460, 141, 2303, 910, 31, 417, 863, 30, 1332, 2, 234, 3642, 1393, 3, 2202, 2, 675, 1, 7452, 1505, 2195, 107, 62, 336, 814, 4, 26, 946, 21, 206, 3, 825, 272, 29, 3, 983, 74, 23, 898, 1019, 318, 1, 62, 2, 1817, 476, 1, 3, 3359, 2695, 1, 74, 914, 2, 65, 17, 1642, 40, 3900, 1149, 6, 3140, 665, 99]",1145.0,19100363,Global genomic characterization acute lymphoblastic leukemia,248,0.2710382513661202

Med.,2009-01-07,"Despite best current therapy, up to 20% of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a relapse. Recent genomewide analyses have identified a high frequency of DNA copy-number abnormalities in ALL, but the prognostic implications of these abnormalities have not been defined. We studied a cohort of 221 children with high-risk B-cell-progenitor ALL with the use of single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays, transcriptional profiling, and resequencing of samples obtained at diagnosis. Children with known very-high-risk ALL subtypes (i.e., BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, hypodiploid ALL, and ALL in infants) were excluded from this cohort. A copy-number abnormality was identified as a predictor of poor outcome, and it was then tested in an independent validation cohort of 258 patients with B-cell-progenitor ALL. More than 50 recurring copy-number abnormalities were identified, most commonly involving genes that encode regulators of B-cell development (in 66.8% of patients in the original cohort); PAX5 was involved in 31.7% and IKZF1 in 28.6% of patients. Using copy-number abnormalities, we identified a predictor of poor outcome that was validated in the independent validation cohort. This predictor was strongly associated with alteration of IKZF1, a gene that encodes the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS. The gene-expression signature of the group of patients with a poor outcome revealed increased expression of hematopoietic stem-cell genes and reduced expression of B-cell-lineage genes, and it was similar to the signature of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, another high-risk subtype of ALL with a high frequency of IKZF1 deletion.

Acute mixed lineage leukemia in children: the experience of St Jude Children's Research Hospital.,Blood,Blood,2009-01-08,"To characterize the biology and optimal therapy of acute mixed-lineage leukemia in children, we reviewed the pathologic and clinical features, including response to therapy, of 35 patients with mixed-lineage leukemia. The majority of cases (91%) had blasts cells that simultaneously expressed either T-lineage plus myeloid markers (T/myeloid, n = 20) or B-lineage plus myeloid markers (B/myeloid, n = 12). Overall survival rates for the B/myeloid and T/myeloid subgroups were not significantly different from each other or from the rate for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but were inferior to the outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients who failed to achieve complete remission with AML-directed therapy could often be induced with a regimen of prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase. Analysis of gene-expression patterns identified a subset of biphenotypic leukemias that did not cluster with T-cell ALL, B-progenitor ALL, or AML.

Potent antitumor activity of the anti-CD19 auristatin antibody drug conjugate hBU12-vcMMAE against rituximab-sensitive and -resistant lymphomas.,Blood,Blood,2009-01-15,"Despite major advances in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including the use of chemotherapeutic agents and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, the majority of patients eventually relapse, and salvage treatments with non-cross-resistant compounds are needed to further improve patient survival. Here, we evaluated the antitumor effects of the microtubule destabilizing agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugated to the humanized anti-CD19 antibody hBU12 via a protease-sensitive valine-citrulline (vc) dipeptide linker. hBU12-vcMMAE induced potent tumor cell killing against rituximab-sensitive and -resistant NHL cell lines. CD19 can form heterodimers with CD21, and high levels of CD21 were reported to interfere negatively with the activity of CD19-targeted therapeutics. However, we observed comparable internalization, intracellular trafficking, and drug release in CD21(low) and CD21(high), rituximab-sensitive and -refractory lymphomas treated with hBU12-vcMMAE. Furthermore, high rates of durable regressions in mice implanted with these tumors were observed, suggesting that both rituximab resistance and CD21 expression levels do not impact on the activity of hBU12-vcMMAE. Combined, our data suggest that hBU12-vcMMAE may represent a promising addition to the treatment options for rituximab refractory NHL and other hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Journal Article,4023.0,64.0,Despite major advances treatment non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL including use chemotherapeutic agents anti-CD20 antibody rituximab majority patients eventually relapse salvage treatments non-cross-resistant compounds needed improve patient survival evaluated antitumor effects microtubule destabilizing agent monomethyl auristatin E MMAE conjugated humanized anti-CD19 antibody hBU12 protease-sensitive valine-citrulline vc dipeptide linker hBU12-vcMMAE induced potent killing rituximab-sensitive -resistant NHL lines CD19 form heterodimers CD21 high levels CD21 reported interfere negatively activity CD19-targeted therapeutics observed comparable internalization intracellular trafficking drug release CD21 low CD21 high rituximab-sensitive -refractory lymphomas treated hBU12-vcMMAE Furthermore high rates durable regressions mice implanted observed suggesting rituximab resistance CD21 expression levels impact activity hBU12-vcMMAE Combined suggest hBU12-vcMMAE represent promising addition treatment options rituximab refractory NHL hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[550, 458, 954, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1176, 141, 3, 119, 1, 1573, 183, 2, 3, 312, 2198, 548, 855, 3, 686, 1, 7, 3124, 429, 2, 992, 640, 5, 220, 1383, 436, 2411, 32, 575, 6, 195, 401, 69, 25, 467, 21, 194, 3, 579, 176, 1, 3, 4621, 19689, 420, 16034, 14235, 563, 12035, 3868, 6, 3, 3619, 312, 3158, 548, 31396, 847, 8, 5125, 745, 12255, 28269, 11468, 18273, 8437, 31396, 26321, 277, 1157, 30, 31, 3003, 480, 855, 745, 2, 436, 1176, 31, 285, 3158, 122, 1297, 15468, 5, 17134, 2, 64, 148, 1, 17134, 11, 210, 6, 6178, 2723, 5, 3, 128, 1, 3158, 238, 1943, 137, 21, 164, 1279, 7520, 2087, 6105, 2, 234, 2008, 4, 17134, 154, 2, 17134, 64, 855, 745, 2, 430, 1557, 73, 5, 31396, 26321, 798, 64, 151, 1, 1480, 5142, 4, 399, 3416, 5, 46, 57, 11, 164, 802, 17, 110, 855, 251, 2, 17134, 55, 148, 1022, 44, 345, 23, 3, 128, 1, 31396, 26321, 397, 114, 74, 309, 17, 31396, 26321, 68, 1231, 8, 721, 352, 6, 3, 24, 838, 9, 855, 430, 1176, 2, 127, 813, 441, 141, 286, 1275]",1350.0,19147785,Potent antitumor activity anti-CD19 auristatin antibody drug conjugate hBU12-vcMMAE rituximab-sensitive -resistant lymphomas,0,0.0
Maternal health conditions during pregnancy and acute leukemia in children with Down syndrome: A Children's Oncology Group study.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-05-01,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) have about a 20-fold increased risk of developing leukemia. Early childhood infections may protect against acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in children with and without DS. We examined whether maternal infections and health conditions during pregnancy were associated with acute leukemia in children with DS. We conducted a case-control study of 158 children with DS and leukemia (including 97 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 61 cases with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and 173 children with DS during the period 1997-2002. Maternal interview included information about 14 maternal conditions during gestation that are likely to induce an inflammatory response. We evaluated their prevalence in cases and controls. Five of these were common enough to allow analyses by leukemia subtype. Vaginal bleeding was the most frequent (18% cases, 25% controls) and was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.33-0.99) for all cases combined. Other variables, while showing a potential trend toward reduced risk had effect estimates, which were imprecise and not statistically significant. In contrast, amniocentesis was marginally associated with an increased risk of AML (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.90-4.69).

Whether administered before, during, or after chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, these agents reduce the duration of neutropenia and seem to be safe and well tolerated. Despite consistently showing a shorter duration of neutropenia, multiple, prospective, randomized trials have documented only modest benefits in terms of reduction in the incidence and severity of infections, without substantial gains or impact in complete remission, overall survival, and disease-free survival rates. Growth factors have also been used to recruit quiescent leukemia cells into the S-phase of the cell cycle to increase their susceptibility to chemotherapy with the goal to reduce relapse and resistance.

Genome-wide interrogation of germline genetic variation associated with treatment response in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,JAMA,JAMA,2009-01-01,"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the prototype for a drug-responsive malignancy. Although cure rates exceed 80%, considerable unexplained interindividual variability exists in treatment response. To assess the contribution of inherited genetic variation to therapy response and to identify germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk of minimal residual disease (MRD) after remission induction chemotherapy. Genome-wide interrogation of 476,796 germline SNPs to identify genotypes that were associated with MRD in 2 independent cohorts of children with newly diagnosed ALL: 318 patients in St Jude Total Therapy protocols XIIIB and XV and 169 patients in Children's Oncology Group trial P9906. Patients were enrolled between 1994 and 2006 and last follow-up was in 2006. Minimal residual disease at the end of induction therapy, measured by flow cytometry. There were 102 SNPs associated with MRD in both cohorts (median odds ratio, 2.18; P < or = .0125), including 5 SNPs in the interleukin 15 (IL15) gene. Of these 102 SNPs, 21 were also associated with hematologic relapse (P < .05).

We report the case of a neonate with ALL who was successfully treated for seizures with levetiracetam monotherapy. This full-term boy did well until 3 days of age when he had an episode of left extremity jerking (07/06/07). Computed tomography of the head demonstrated extensive multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Initial EEG demonstrated multifocal epileptiform activity. Patient was loaded with Phenobarbital at 20 mg/kg. Complete blood count revealed leukocytosis (78 x 103/mm(3)). Peripheral blood smear contained blastocytes and DNA analysis confirmed B-cell ALL. A second focal seizure was reported on the same day and he was re-loaded with Phenobarbital. Maintenance dosing of Phenobarbital was initiated and no further seizures were noted. A repeat EEG on 7/10/07 remained abnormal with excessive multifocal sharp waves. Continuation of anticonvulsant therapy was recommended. Given concern for interaction between Phenobarbital and planned chemotherapy regimen, oncology requested a non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsant. Phenobarbital was subsequently weaned and Levetiracetam monotherapy initiated at 40 mg/kg/day (07/10/2007). Currently, the patient is seizure free at 8 months of age on Levetiracetam monotherapy.

The novel plant-derived agent silvestrol has B-cell selective activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vitro and in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2009-02-03,"Therapeutic options for advanced B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are limited. Available treatments can also deplete T lymphocytes, leaving patients at risk of life-threatening infections. In the National Cancer Institute cell line screen, the structurally unique natural product silvestrol produces an unusual pattern of cytotoxicity that suggests activity in leukemia and selectivity for B cells. We investigated silvestrol efficacy using primary human B-leukemia cells, established B-leukemia cell lines, and animal models. In CLL cells, silvestrol LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) is 6.9 nM at 72 hours. At this concentration, there is no difference in sensitivity of cells from patients with or without the del(17p13.1) abnormality. In isolated cells and whole blood, silvestrol is more cytotoxic toward B cells than T cells. Silvestrol causes early reduction in Mcl-1 expression due to translational inhibition with subsequent mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by reactive oxygen species generation and membrane depolarization. In vivo, silvestrol causes significant B-cell reduction in Emu-Tcl-1 transgenic mice and significantly extends survival of 697 xenograft severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice without discernible toxicity. These data indicate silvestrol has efficacy against B cells in vitro and in vivo and identify translational inhibition as a potential therapeutic target in B-cell leukemias.",Journal Article,4004.0,118.0,Therapeutic options advanced B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL limited Available treatments deplete lymphocytes leaving patients risk life-threatening infections National Institute line screen structurally unique natural product silvestrol produces unusual pattern cytotoxicity suggests activity leukemia selectivity B investigated silvestrol efficacy primary human B-leukemia established B-leukemia lines animal models CLL silvestrol LC 50 concentration lethal 50 6.9 nM 72 hours concentration difference sensitivity patients del 17p13.1 abnormality isolated blood silvestrol cytotoxic B Silvestrol causes early reduction Mcl-1 expression translational inhibition subsequent mitochondrial damage evidenced reactive oxygen species generation membrane depolarization vivo silvestrol causes significant B-cell reduction Emu-Tcl-1 transgenic mice significantly extends survival 697 xenograft severe combined immunodeficient SCID mice discernible toxicity indicate silvestrol efficacy B vitro vivo identify translational inhibition potential therapeutic target B-cell leukemias,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[189, 838, 9, 131, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 442, 1193, 552, 32, 383, 390, 640, 122, 120, 9450, 102, 1594, 7806, 7, 28, 43, 1, 358, 3691, 1875, 4, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 31, 328, 2413, 3, 8533, 991, 1504, 2821, 10015, 4042, 35, 4015, 1177, 1, 1408, 17, 844, 128, 4, 2, 6072, 9, 132, 37, 21, 565, 10015, 209, 75, 86, 171, 132, 2647, 37, 635, 132, 2647, 31, 285, 2, 2026, 274, 4, 552, 37, 10015, 1837, 212, 1227, 2266, 6, 212, 16, 49, 83, 2878, 28, 720, 1459, 28, 26, 1227, 125, 16, 77, 523, 4, 485, 1, 37, 29, 7, 5, 15, 187, 3, 3084, 7526, 14, 3698, 4, 1355, 37, 2, 902, 315, 10015, 16, 80, 759, 1317, 132, 37, 76, 102, 37, 10015, 1626, 191, 628, 4, 1308, 14, 55, 520, 6, 2460, 297, 5, 706, 2019, 1350, 22, 4728, 20, 2163, 2848, 2915, 914, 2, 1905, 14809, 4, 386, 10015, 1626, 93, 132, 31, 628, 4, 28315, 8885, 14, 2862, 399, 2, 97, 8464, 25, 1, 11989, 1330, 905, 397, 5031, 4129, 399, 187, 19070, 155, 46, 74, 1008, 10015, 71, 209, 480, 132, 37, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 2, 255, 2460, 297, 22, 8, 174, 189, 283, 4, 132, 31, 2792]",1414.0,19190247,novel plant-derived agent silvestrol B-cell selective activity chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia vitro vivo,3,0.003278688524590164

Immunother.,,"On the basis of promising preclinical data demonstrating the eradication of systemic B-cell malignancies by CD19-targeted T lymphocytes in vivo in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mouse models, we are launching phase I clinical trials in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We present here the validation of the bioprocess which we developed for the production and expansion of clinical grade autologous T cells derived from patients with CLL. We demonstrate that T cells genetically modified with a replication-defective gammaretroviral vector derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted to CD19 (1928z) can be expanded with Dynabeads CD3/CD28. This bioprocess allows us to generate clinical doses of 1928z+ T cells in approximately 2 to 3 weeks in a large-scale semiclosed culture system using the Wave Bioreactor. These 1928z+ T cells remain biologically functional not only in vitro but also in severe combined immunodeficient-beige mice bearing disseminated tumors. The validation requirements in terms of T-cell expansion, T-cell transduction with the 1928z CAR, biologic activity, quality control testing, and release criteria were met for all 4 validation runs using apheresis products from patients with CLL. Additionally, after expansion of the T cells, the diversity of the skewed Vbeta T-cell receptor repertoire was significantly restored. This validated process will be used in phase I clinical trials in patients with chemorefractory CLL and in patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It can also be adapted for other clinical trials involving the expansion and transduction of patient or donor T cells using any CAR or T-cell receptor.",Journal Article,,159.0,basis promising preclinical demonstrating eradication systemic B-cell malignancies CD19-targeted lymphocytes vivo severe combined immunodeficient-beige mouse models launching phase clinical trials patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL acute lymphoblastic leukemia present validation bioprocess developed production expansion clinical grade autologous derived patients CLL demonstrate genetically modified replication-defective gammaretroviral vector derived Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding chimeric antigen receptor CAR targeted CD19 1928z expanded Dynabeads CD3/CD28 bioprocess allows generate clinical doses 1928z+ approximately 2 3 weeks large-scale semiclosed culture Wave Bioreactor 1928z+ remain biologically functional vitro severe combined immunodeficient-beige mice bearing disseminated validation requirements terms T-cell expansion T-cell transduction 1928z CAR biologic activity quality control testing release criteria met 4 validation runs apheresis products patients CLL Additionally expansion diversity skewed Vbeta T-cell receptor repertoire significantly restored validated process phase clinical trials patients chemorefractory CLL patients relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia adapted clinical trials involving expansion transduction patient donor CAR T-cell receptor,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[23, 3, 877, 1, 721, 693, 74, 2219, 3, 5173, 1, 403, 132, 31, 441, 20, 3158, 238, 102, 1594, 4, 386, 4, 905, 397, 5031, 16620, 830, 274, 21, 32, 28241, 124, 70, 38, 143, 4, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 2, 286, 1275, 21, 364, 467, 3, 929, 1, 3, 34641, 92, 21, 276, 9, 3, 1529, 2, 1422, 1, 38, 88, 1028, 102, 37, 526, 29, 7, 5, 552, 21, 608, 17, 102, 37, 2301, 1230, 5, 8, 2079, 4552, 45448, 3374, 526, 29, 3, 33793, 1471, 1450, 2362, 8, 2897, 448, 153, 1881, 238, 6, 3158, 34642, 122, 40, 2064, 5, 57705, 3117, 5603, 26, 34641, 2333, 843, 6, 2562, 38, 415, 1, 34642, 102, 37, 4, 705, 18, 6, 27, 244, 4, 8, 375, 1124, 57706, 2099, 398, 75, 3, 10320, 38493, 46, 34642, 102, 37, 918, 2665, 583, 44, 158, 4, 439, 84, 120, 4, 905, 397, 5031, 16620, 399, 1894, 3605, 57, 3, 929, 4230, 4, 1794, 1, 102, 31, 1422, 102, 31, 2761, 5, 3, 34642, 1881, 1283, 128, 372, 182, 471, 2, 2008, 371, 11, 543, 9, 62, 39, 929, 31027, 75, 9456, 2766, 29, 7, 5, 552, 1724, 50, 1422, 1, 3, 102, 37, 3, 3653, 1, 3, 16082, 18819, 102, 31, 153, 5306, 10, 97, 4138, 26, 938, 1129, 303, 40, 95, 4, 124, 70, 38, 143, 4, 7, 5, 8923, 552, 2, 4, 7, 5, 591, 286, 1275, 192, 122, 120, 40, 3716, 9, 127, 38, 143, 1267, 3, 1422, 2, 2761, 1, 69, 15, 1488, 102, 37, 75, 500, 1881, 15, 102, 31, 153]",1713.0,19238016,Manufacturing validation biologically functional targeted CD19 antigen autologous adoptive therapy,9,0.009836065573770493
Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: update on prognostic factors.,Current opinion in pediatrics,Curr. Opin. Pediatr.,2009-02-01,"With current treatment regimens, event-free survival rates for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) approach or exceed 80%. This success was achieved, in part, through the implementation of risk-stratified therapy. However, for the 15-20% of children with newly diagnosed ALL who will ultimately relapse, traditional risk assessment remains inadequate. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of prognostic factors that may be used to refine risk group classification. An increasingly sophisticated understanding of genetic abnormalities in leukemia cells (including chromosomal abnormalities and patterns of gene expression), response to treatment, and host pharmacogenomics offers the potential to enhance or supplant currently applied prognostic criteria for use in treatment planning for childhood ALL. Identification of biologically distinctive subsets of ALL through cytogenetic, molecular, and gene expression studies, as well as investigations of minimal residual disease and host pharmacogenomics, offer promising avenues of research. Integration of molecular tools into clinical practice will ultimately allow for more precise risk stratification and individualized treatment planning.",Journal Article,4006.0,64.0,current treatment regimens event-free survival rates childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia approach exceed 80 success achieved implementation risk-stratified therapy 15-20 children newly diagnosed ultimately relapse traditional risk assessment remains inadequate review highlights recent advances understanding prognostic factors refine risk group classification increasingly sophisticated understanding genetic abnormalities leukemia including chromosomal abnormalities patterns expression response treatment host pharmacogenomics offers potential enhance supplant currently applied prognostic criteria use treatment planning childhood Identification biologically distinctive subsets cytogenetic molecular expression studies investigations minimal residual disease host pharmacogenomics offer promising avenues research Integration molecular tools clinical practice ultimately allow precise risk stratification individualized treatment planning,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5, 291, 24, 472, 774, 115, 25, 151, 9, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 353, 15, 6818, 493, 26, 1825, 10, 513, 4, 760, 298, 3, 2393, 1, 43, 1173, 36, 137, 9, 3, 167, 179, 1, 541, 5, 732, 265, 62, 54, 303, 2050, 429, 1847, 43, 455, 469, 3358, 26, 206, 2527, 435, 954, 4, 114, 612, 1, 177, 130, 17, 68, 40, 95, 6, 5003, 43, 87, 947, 35, 1635, 8023, 612, 1, 336, 1171, 4, 37, 141, 1860, 1171, 2, 764, 1, 145, 55, 51, 6, 24, 2, 1204, 7603, 2339, 3, 174, 6, 1304, 15, 20329, 694, 1498, 177, 371, 9, 119, 4, 24, 1349, 9, 864, 62, 911, 1, 2665, 5049, 1890, 1, 62, 298, 1266, 219, 2, 145, 55, 94, 22, 149, 22, 2492, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 2, 1204, 7603, 1918, 721, 6612, 1, 389, 2676, 1, 219, 1896, 237, 38, 758, 303, 2050, 1700, 9, 80, 3260, 43, 1541, 2, 2596, 24, 1349]",1181.0,19242236,Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia update prognostic factors,99,0.10819672131147541
Prospective outcome data on 267 unselected adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia confirms superiority of allogeneic transplantation over chemotherapy in the pre-imatinib era: results from the International ALL Trial MRC UKALLXII/ECOG2993.,Blood,Blood,2009-02-24,"Prospective data on the value of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are limited. The UKALLXII/ECOG 2993 study evaluated the outcome of assigning alloHSCT with a sibling (sib) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) to patients younger than 55 years of age achieving complete remission (CR). The CR rate of 267 patients, median age 40, was 82%. Twenty-eight percent of patients proceeded to alloHSCT in first CR. Age older than 55 years or a pre-HSCT event were the most common reasons for failure to progress to alloHSCT. At 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 44% after sib alloHSCT, 36% after MUD alloHSCT, and 19% after chemotherapy. After adjustment for sex, age, and white blood count and excluding chemotherapy-treated patients who relapsed or died before the median time to alloHSCT, only relapse-free survival remained significantly superior in the alloHSCT group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.61). An intention-to-treat analysis, using the availability or not of a matched sibling donor, showed 5-year OS to be nonsignificantly better at 34% with a donor versus 25% with no donor.

Failure to achieve a complete hematologic response at the time of a major cytogenetic response with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with a poor prognosis among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated or blast phase.,Blood,Blood,2009-03-12,"Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Occasionally, patients with Ph(+) ALL, or accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML achieve a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) but not a complete hematologic response (CHR). We analyzed 126 patients with CML in AP or BP, or with Ph(+) ALL treated with dasatinib or nilotinib after imatinib failure. Twenty patients received sequential treatment with both dasatinib and nilotinib for a total of 146 instances. CHR and MCyR rates were 54% and 37%, respectively in AP, 17% and 39% in BP, and 33% and 50% in Ph+ ALL. Failure to achieve a CHR at the time of achievement of a MCyR was associated with an inferior outcome, similar to that of patients without a MCyR (2-year survival rate, 37% and 35%, respectively). In contrast, patients with MCyR and concomitant CHR had a 77% 2-year survival rate. Twelve of 29 patients with MCyR without concomitant CHR later achieved a CHR; the 2-year survival rate for these patients was 55% compared with 22% for those who never achieved a CHR.

Clinical course and outcome in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and asparaginase-associated pancreatitis.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-08-01,"Asparaginase, an agent used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is associated with the development of pancreatitis. The clinical course and long-term outcome of patients experiencing this complication has not been extensively detailed. We reviewed the clinical course for all children with ALL diagnosed with pancreatitis at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Children's Hospital Boston between 1987 and 2003. The outcome of these patients was compared with that of patients with ALL who did not experience pancreatitis. Twenty-eight of 403 children (7%) were diagnosed with pancreatitis. Patients 10-18 years old at diagnosis had 2.4 times the risk of developing pancreatitis compared with younger patients. Pancreatitis typically occurred early in the course of therapy (median 4 weeks after first dose of asparaginase). Ninety-three percent of affected patients were hospitalized and 57% received parenteral nutrition. No patient developed chronic sequelae or died as a result of pancreatitis. Sixteen (57%) patients were re-treated with asparaginase, 10 of whom had another episode of pancreatitis. No significant differences in event-free survival were observed when comparing patients with and without a history of pancreatitis.

JAK mutations in high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009-05-22,"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease consisting of distinct clinical and biological subtypes that are characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities or gene mutations. Mutation of genes encoding tyrosine kinases is uncommon in ALL, with the exception of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, where the t(9,22)(q34;q11) translocation encodes the constitutively active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. We recently identified a poor prognostic subgroup of pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative ALL patients characterized by deletion of IKZF1 (encoding the lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS) and a gene expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, raising the possibility of activated tyrosine kinase signaling within this leukemia subtype. Here, we report activating mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 (n = 3), JAK2 (n = 16), and JAK3 (n = 1) in 20 (10.7%) of 187 BCR-ABL1-negative, high-risk pediatric ALL cases. The JAK1 and JAK2 mutations involved highly conserved residues in the kinase and pseudokinase domains and resulted in constitutive JAK-STAT activation and growth factor independence of Ba/F3-EpoR cells. The presence of JAK mutations was significantly associated with alteration of IKZF1 (70% of all JAK-mutated cases and 87.5% of cases with JAK2 mutations; P = 0.001) and deletion of CDKN2A/B (70% of all JAK-mutated cases and 68.9% of JAK2-mutated cases). The JAK-mutated cases had a gene expression signature similar to BCR-ABL1 pediatric ALL, and they had a poor outcome. These results suggest that inhibition of JAK signaling is a logical target for therapeutic intervention in JAK mutated ALL.",Journal Article,3896.0,373.0,"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia heterogeneous disease consisting distinct clinical subtypes characterized specific chromosomal abnormalities encoding tyrosine kinases uncommon exception Philadelphia chromosome-positive 9,22 q34 q11 translocation encodes constitutively active BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase recently identified poor prognostic subgroup pediatric BCR-ABL1-negative patients characterized deletion IKZF1 encoding lymphoid transcription factor IKAROS expression signature similar BCR-ABL1-positive raising possibility activated tyrosine kinase signaling leukemia subtype report activating Janus kinases JAK1 n 3 JAK2 n 16 JAK3 n 1 20 10.7 187 BCR-ABL1-negative high-risk pediatric cases JAK1 JAK2 involved highly conserved residues kinase pseudokinase domains resulted constitutive JAK-STAT activation growth factor independence Ba/F3-EpoR presence JAK significantly associated alteration IKZF1 70 JAK-mutated cases 87.5 cases JAK2 P 0.001 deletion CDKN2A/B 70 JAK-mutated cases 68.9 JAK2-mutated cases JAK-mutated cases expression signature similar BCR-ABL1 pediatric poor outcome suggest inhibition JAK signaling logical target therapeutic intervention JAK",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[815, 286, 1275, 62, 16, 8, 1564, 34, 2273, 1, 834, 38, 2, 1037, 814, 17, 32, 765, 20, 112, 1860, 1171, 15, 145, 138, 258, 1, 214, 2362, 564, 1549, 16, 2052, 4, 62, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 3006, 1170, 109, 62, 1257, 3, 102, 83, 350, 16609, 11532, 2006, 4322, 3, 2818, 544, 1062, 3557, 564, 216, 21, 761, 108, 8, 334, 177, 1363, 1, 815, 1062, 3557, 199, 62, 7, 765, 20, 1528, 1, 8422, 2362, 3, 2303, 866, 161, 20613, 2, 8, 145, 55, 1651, 288, 6, 1062, 3557, 109, 62, 6627, 3, 2526, 1, 735, 564, 216, 314, 262, 26, 875, 467, 21, 414, 1616, 138, 4, 3, 6191, 1549, 8075, 78, 27, 2509, 78, 245, 2, 18927, 78, 14, 4, 179, 79, 67, 1, 5568, 1062, 3557, 199, 64, 43, 815, 62, 140, 3, 8075, 2, 2509, 138, 646, 561, 5547, 6418, 4, 3, 216, 2, 39000, 2703, 2, 627, 4, 3178, 4653, 4168, 363, 2, 129, 161, 5773, 1, 6669, 6904, 12839, 37, 3, 463, 1, 4653, 138, 10, 97, 41, 5, 2611, 1, 8422, 431, 1, 62, 4653, 1185, 140, 2, 912, 33, 1, 140, 5, 2509, 138, 19, 13, 144, 2, 1528, 1, 3175, 132, 431, 1, 62, 4653, 1185, 140, 2, 806, 83, 1, 2509, 1185, 140, 3, 4653, 1185, 140, 42, 8, 145, 55, 1651, 288, 6, 1062, 3557, 815, 62, 2, 491, 42, 8, 334, 228, 46, 99, 309, 17, 297, 1, 4653, 314, 16, 8, 10405, 283, 9, 189, 788, 4, 4653, 1185, 62]",1580.0,19470474,JAK high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,77,0.08415300546448087
Flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay as a predictive tool of early clinical response in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-10-01,"Residual disease or rapidity of response to induction therapy is among the most powerful predictors of outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Utilizing a multiparameter flow cytometric chemosensitivity assay (FCCA), we studied the relationship between in vitro drug sensitivity of diagnostic leukemic blasts from 30 children with ALL and rapidity of response to induction therapy. We also analyzed the in vitro drug sensitivity of de novo leukemic blasts among various clinical subsets. Compared to rapid early responders (RERs), slow early responders (SERs) had a significantly greater in vitro drug resistance to dexamethasone (DEX; P = 0.04) and prednisone (P = 0.05). The studies with all other drugs showed a non-significant trend with the SER having a higher in vitro drug resistance compared to the RER.

Treating childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia without cranial irradiation.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2009-06-01,"Prophylactic cranial irradiation has been a standard treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are at high risk for central nervous system (CNS) relapse. We conducted a clinical trial to test whether prophylactic cranial irradiation could be omitted from treatment in all children with newly diagnosed ALL. A total of 498 patients who could be evaluated were enrolled. Treatment intensity was based on presenting features and the level of minimal residual disease after remission-induction treatment. The duration of continuous complete remission in the 71 patients who previously would have received prophylactic cranial irradiation was compared with that of 56 historical controls who received it. The 5-year event-free and overall survival probabilities for all 498 patients were 85.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79.9 to 91.3) and 93.5% (95% CI, 89.8 to 97.2), respectively. The 5-year cumulative risk of isolated CNS relapse was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3), and that of any CNS relapse (including isolated relapse and combined relapse) was 3.9% (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.9). The 71 patients had significantly longer continuous complete remission than the 56 historical controls (P=0.04). All 11 patients with isolated CNS relapse remained in second remission for 0.4 to 5.5 years. CNS leukemia (CNS-3 status) or a traumatic lumbar puncture with blast cells at diagnosis and a high level of minimal residual disease (> or = 1%) after 6 weeks of remission induction were significantly associated with poorer event-free survival. Risk factors for CNS relapse included the genetic abnormality t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1), any CNS involvement at diagnosis, and T-cell immunophenotype. Common adverse effects included allergic reactions to asparaginase, osteonecrosis, thrombosis, and disseminated fungal infection. With effective risk-adjusted chemotherapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation can be safely omitted from the treatment of childhood ALL.

"Donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics as risk factors after unrelated donor PBSC transplantation: beneficial effects of higher CD34+ cell dose.",Blood,Blood,2009-07-16,"We report outcomes of 932 recipients of unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-PBSC HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome enrolled on a prospective National Marrow Donor Program trial from 1999 through 2003. Preparative regimens included myeloablative (MA; N = 611), reduced-intensity (RI; N = 160), and nonmyeloablative (NMA; N = 161). For MA recipients, CD34(+) counts greater than 3.8 x 10(6)/kg improved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, whereas improved overall survival (OS) and reduced transplant-related mortality (TRM) were seen for all preparative regimens when CD34(+) cell doses exceeded 4.5 x 10(6)/kg. Higher infused doses of CD34(+) cell dose did not result in increased rates of either acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of recipients of MA, RI, and NMA approaches were similar (33%, 35%, and 32% OS; 33%, 30%, and 29% DFS, respectively). In summary, recipients of URD-PBSC HCT receiving preparative regimens differing in intensity experienced similar survival. Higher CD34(+) cell doses resulted in more rapid engraftment, less TRM, and better 3-year OS (39% versus 25%, MA, P = .004; 38% versus 21% RI/NMA, P = .004) but did not increase the risk of GVHD.

We sought to evaluate the outcome according to mutation status of patients with adult T-ALL treated on the United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia XII (UKALLXII)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E2993 protocol. NOTCH1 and FBXW7 were screened by a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing in 88 adult patients with T-ALL treated on the UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 protocol and compared with clinical characteristics and outcome.

Cellular therapies in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Current opinion in molecular therapeutics,Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther.,2009-08-01,"The majority of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will die from the disease. Although the prognosis for pediatric patients is significantly better than for adult patients with ALL, the prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory disease is poor in all cases. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from a related donor offers a significant therapeutic benefit for pediatric patients, although the benefit of this therapy to adults with ALL is less established. Because most patients lack a suitable related donor, alternative approaches to allo-HSCT, including umbilical cord blood, and unrelated and haploidentical allo-HSCT, have been investigated in the clinical setting. Although treatment with donor-derived T-cells, so-called 'donor lymphocyte infusion', has demonstrated poor outcomes in patients with relapsed ALL following HSCT, modified adoptive T-cell regimens, including the infusion of enriched tumor-targeted donor T-cells and genetically targeted T-cells, are currently under clinical investigation. In addition, the resistance of ALL tumor cell lines to NK-cell-mediated lysis may be overcome by the genetic modification of NK cells to target ALL tumor cell antigens, and this approach will be evaluated in an upcoming clinical trial.

Genomic analysis reveals few genetic alterations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009-07-27,"Pediatric de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy with current therapy resulting in cure rates of only 60%. To better understand the cause of the marked heterogeneity in therapeutic response and to identify new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets a comprehensive list of the genetic mutations that underlie the pathogenesis of AML is needed. To approach this goal, we examined diagnostic leukemic samples from a cohort of 111 children with de novo AML using single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays and candidate gene resequencing. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), de novo AML is characterized by a very low burden of genomic alterations, with a mean of only 2.38 somatic copy-number alterations per leukemia, and less than 1 nonsynonymous point mutation per leukemia in the 25 genes analyzed. Even more surprising was the observation that 34% of the leukemias lacked any identifiable copy-number alterations, and 28% of the leukemias with recurrent translocations lacked any identifiable sequence or numerical abnormalities. The only exception to the presence of few mutations was acute megakaryocytic leukemias, with the majority of these leukemias being characterized by a high number of copy-number alterations but rare point mutations. Despite the low overall number of lesions across the patient cohort, novel recurring regions of genetic alteration were identified that harbor known, and potential new cancer genes. These data reflect a remarkably low burden of genomic alterations within pediatric de novo AML, which is in stark contrast to most other human malignancies.",Journal Article,3830.0,119.0,Pediatric novo acute myeloid leukemia AML aggressive malignancy current therapy resulting cure rates 60 better understand cause marked heterogeneity therapeutic response identify new prognostic markers therapeutic targets comprehensive list genetic underlie pathogenesis AML needed approach goal examined diagnostic leukemic cohort 111 children novo AML single-nucleotide-polymorphism microarrays candidate resequencing demonstrate contrast pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia novo AML characterized low burden genomic alterations mean 2.38 somatic copy-number alterations leukemia 1 nonsynonymous point leukemia 25 surprising observation 34 leukemias lacked identifiable copy-number alterations 28 leukemias recurrent translocations lacked identifiable sequence numerical abnormalities exception presence acute megakaryocytic leukemias majority leukemias characterized high number copy-number alterations rare point Despite low overall number lesions patient cohort novel recurring regions genetic alteration identified harbor known potential new reflect remarkably low burden genomic alterations pediatric novo AML stark contrast human malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[815, 1566, 2018, 286, 533, 329, 16, 35, 571, 710, 5, 291, 36, 1113, 4, 1722, 151, 1, 158, 335, 6, 380, 1640, 3, 708, 1, 3, 2003, 1144, 4, 189, 51, 2, 6, 255, 217, 177, 525, 2, 189, 637, 8, 949, 4754, 1, 3, 336, 138, 17, 5875, 3, 1384, 1, 329, 16, 575, 6, 353, 26, 1326, 21, 409, 752, 2015, 347, 29, 8, 180, 1, 3167, 541, 5, 1566, 2018, 329, 75, 226, 1579, 1907, 2774, 2, 1609, 145, 11819, 114, 74, 608, 17, 4, 748, 6, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 1566, 2018, 329, 16, 765, 20, 8, 923, 154, 892, 1, 572, 593, 5, 8, 313, 1, 158, 18, 519, 1119, 1337, 207, 593, 379, 2, 299, 76, 14, 10233, 741, 258, 379, 4, 3, 243, 214, 311, 871, 80, 14157, 10, 3, 1664, 17, 562, 1, 3, 2792, 5005, 500, 6237, 1337, 207, 593, 2, 339, 1, 3, 2792, 5, 387, 3262, 5005, 500, 6237, 1532, 15, 8736, 1171, 3, 158, 4188, 6, 3, 463, 1, 1021, 138, 10, 286, 14385, 2792, 5, 3, 686, 1, 46, 2792, 486, 765, 20, 8, 64, 207, 1, 1337, 207, 593, 84, 622, 741, 138, 550, 3, 154, 63, 207, 1, 406, 716, 3, 69, 180, 229, 6385, 1374, 1, 336, 2611, 11, 108, 17, 2760, 440, 2, 174, 217, 12, 214, 46, 74, 2694, 8, 4856, 154, 892, 1, 572, 593, 262, 815, 1566, 2018, 329, 92, 16, 4, 16702, 748, 6, 96, 127, 171, 441]",1607.0,19651601,Genomic reveals genetic alterations pediatric acute myeloid leukemia,61,0.06666666666666667
Outcome of congenital acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on the Interfant-99 protocol.,Blood,Blood,2009-08-05,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed in the first month of life (congenital ALL) is very rare. Although congenital ALL is often assumed to be fatal, no studies have been published on outcome except for case reports. The present study reports the outcome of 30 patients with congenital ALL treated with the uniform Interfant-99 protocol, a hybrid regimen combining ALL treatment with elements designed for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Congenital ALL was characterized by a higher white blood cell count and a strong trend for higher incidence of MLL rearrangements and CD10-negative B-lineage ALL compared with older infants. Induction failure rate was 13% and not significantly different from that in older infants (7%, P = .14), but relapse rate was significantly higher in congenital ALL patients (2-year cumulative incidence [SE] was 60.0 [9.3] vs 34.2 [2.3], P < .001). Two-year event-free survival and survival of congenital ALL patients treated with this protocol was 20% (SE 9.1%). Early death in complete remission and treatment delays resulting from toxicity were not different. The survival of 17% after last follow-up, combined with a toxicity profile comparable with that in older infants, justifies treating congenital ALL with curative intent.

Central nervous system disease in hematologic malignancies: historical perspective and practical applications.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2009-08-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 5-year survival rates are approaching 90% in children and 50% in adults who are receiving contemporary risk-directed treatment protocols. Current efforts focus not only on further improving cure rate but also on patient quality of life. Hence, all protocols decrease or limit the use of cranial irradiation as central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy, even in patients with high-risk presenting features, such as the presence of leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (even resulting from traumatic lumbar puncture), adverse genetic features, T-cell immunophenotype, and a large leukemia cell burden. Current strategies for CNS-directed therapy involve effective systemic chemotherapy (eg, dexamethasone, high-dose methotrexate, intensive asparaginase) and early intensification and optimization of intrathecal therapy. Options under investigation for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CNS leukemia in ALL patients include thiotepa and intrathecal liposomal cytarabine. CNS involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is associated with young age, advanced stage, number of extranodal sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and International Prognostic Index score. Refractory CNS lymphoma in patients with NHL carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of 2 to 6 months; the most promising treatment, autologous stem cell transplant, can extend median survival from 10 to 26 months. CNS prophylaxis is required during the initial treatment of NHL subtypes that carry a high risk of CNS relapse, such as B-cell ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma. The use of CNS prophylaxis in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is controversial because of the low risk of CNS relapse ( approximately 5%) in this population. In this article, we review current and past practice of intrathecal therapy in ALL and NHL and the risk models that aim to identify predictors of CNS relapse in NHL.",Journal Article,3825.0,101.0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 5-year survival rates approaching 90 children 50 adults receiving contemporary risk-directed treatment protocols Current efforts focus improving cure rate patient quality life protocols decrease limit use cranial irradiation central nervous CNS -directed therapy patients high-risk presenting features presence leukemia cerebrospinal fluid resulting traumatic lumbar puncture adverse genetic features T-cell immunophenotype large leukemia burden Current strategies CNS-directed therapy involve effective systemic chemotherapy dexamethasone high-dose methotrexate intensive asparaginase early intensification optimization intrathecal therapy Options investigation treatment relapsed refractory CNS leukemia patients include thiotepa intrathecal liposomal cytarabine CNS involvement non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL associated young age advanced stage number extranodal sites elevated lactate dehydrogenase International Prognostic Index score Refractory CNS lymphoma patients NHL carries poor prognosis median survival 2 6 months promising treatment autologous stem transplant extend median survival 10 26 months CNS prophylaxis required initial treatment NHL subtypes carry high risk CNS relapse B-cell Burkitt lymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma use CNS prophylaxis treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma controversial low risk CNS relapse approximately 5 population article review current past practice intrathecal therapy NHL risk models aim identify predictors CNS relapse NHL,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 1275, 62, 33, 111, 25, 151, 32, 7773, 424, 4, 541, 2, 212, 4, 857, 54, 32, 357, 2667, 43, 1166, 24, 2189, 291, 1413, 1222, 44, 158, 23, 195, 1673, 1722, 116, 84, 120, 23, 69, 372, 1, 358, 3665, 62, 2189, 775, 15, 2385, 3, 119, 1, 2565, 1104, 22, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 1166, 36, 871, 4, 7, 5, 64, 43, 1656, 404, 225, 22, 3, 463, 1, 37, 4, 3, 5156, 2357, 871, 1113, 29, 11272, 6187, 12104, 290, 336, 404, 102, 31, 5496, 2, 8, 375, 31, 892, 291, 422, 9, 1025, 1166, 36, 3882, 323, 403, 56, 2887, 1217, 64, 61, 2116, 1686, 3709, 2, 191, 5091, 2, 3980, 1, 5126, 36, 838, 669, 940, 9, 3, 24, 1, 591, 15, 430, 1025, 4, 62, 7, 643, 8182, 2, 5126, 3275, 1855, 1025, 799, 4, 1176, 16, 41, 5, 1169, 89, 131, 82, 207, 1, 4093, 633, 804, 3330, 2374, 2, 944, 177, 558, 368, 430, 1025, 4, 7, 5, 1176, 4942, 8, 334, 356, 5, 8, 52, 25, 1, 18, 6, 49, 53, 3, 96, 721, 24, 1028, 452, 31, 941, 122, 4087, 52, 25, 29, 79, 6, 432, 53, 1025, 2049, 16, 616, 190, 3, 388, 24, 1, 1176, 814, 17, 3542, 8, 64, 43, 1, 1025, 429, 225, 22, 132, 31, 62, 2, 1275, 3, 119, 1, 1025, 2049, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 16, 2010, 408, 1, 3, 154, 43, 1, 1025, 429, 705, 33, 4, 26, 266, 4, 26, 946, 21, 206, 291, 2, 1219, 758, 1, 5126, 36, 4, 62, 2, 1176, 2, 3, 43, 274, 17, 1130, 6, 255, 674, 1, 1025, 429, 4, 1176]",1806.0,19660680,Central nervous disease hematologic malignancies historical perspective practical applications,47,0.05136612021857923
Erwinia asparaginase after allergy to E. coli asparaginase in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-02-01,"Escherichia coli asparaginase is an important component of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, hypersensitivity develops in up to 30% of patients. We assessed the nadir enzyme activity and tolerability of Erwinia asparaginase, an alternative preparation, in E. coli asparaginase-allergic patients. Between 2000 and 2002, 215 children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 and were to receive 30 weekly doses of intramuscular E. coli asparaginase. If E. coli asparaginase allergy developed, patients were switched to twice-weekly intramuscular Erwinia asparaginase (25,000 IU/m(2)). Nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) was measured every 3 weeks. Forty-two patients (20%) developed E. coli asparaginase allergy and switched to Erwinia. Of 38 patients with evaluable samples, 34 (89%) Erwinia-treated patients had at least one therapeutic NSAA (> or =0.1 IU/ml). The median NSAA was 0.247 IU/ml 3 days and 0.077 IU/ml 4 days after an Erwinia dose. Associated toxicities included allergy in 14 (33%) and pancreatitis in 3 patients (7%). At a median follow-up of 5.4 years, event-free survival (+/-standard error) of the 42 patients who switched to Erwinia was 86 +/- 5% compared with 81 +/- 3% for the 170 patients without E. coli asparaginase allergy (P = 0.55).

Phase 1 multicenter study of vincristine sulfate liposomes injection and dexamethasone in adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-12-01,"Dose intensification of chemotherapy has improved outcome for younger adults with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Novel formulations of standard chemotherapy agents may further reduce the incidence of disease recurrence after frontline chemotherapy. Vincristine (VCR) sulfate liposomes injection (VSLI) is a sphingomyelin/cholesterol nanoparticle encapsulated VCR formulation that improves the pharmacokinetic profile of VCR without augmenting neurotoxicity. A phase 1 trial of weekly, intravenous VSLI at 1.5 mg/m(2), 1.825 mg/m(2), 2.0 mg/m(2), 2.25 mg/m(2), or 2.4 mg/m(2) was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a standard, 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Dexamethasone (40 mg) was given on Days 1 through 4 and on Days 11 through 14 of each 4-week cycle. Thirty-six adults with relapsed/refractory ALL, all previously treated with conventional VCR, received at least 1 dose of VSLI. The MTD of VSLI was 2.25 mg/m(2) based on dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 motor neuropathy, grade 4 seizure, and grade 4 hepatotoxicity in 1 patient each at the 2.4 mg/m(2) dose level. The most common toxicities attributed to VSLI included peripheral neuropathy (55%) and constipation (53%). A complete response (CR) was achieved in 7 of 36 patients (19%) based on an intent-to-treat analysis; the CR rate was 29% for the 14 patients who underwent therapy as their first salvage attempt. Four of 7 patients who achieved a CR underwent subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in remission. In this study, VSLI plus dexamethasone appeared to be an effective salvage therapy option for relapsed/refractory ALL. A phase 2, international, multicenter clinical trial assessing the efficacy of single-agent VSLI as second salvage therapy for patients with previously treated ALL is underway.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3703.0,41.0,Dose intensification chemotherapy improved outcome younger adults novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia Novel formulations standard chemotherapy agents reduce incidence disease recurrence frontline chemotherapy Vincristine VCR sulfate liposomes injection VSLI sphingomyelin/cholesterol nanoparticle encapsulated VCR formulation improves pharmacokinetic profile VCR augmenting neurotoxicity phase 1 trial weekly intravenous VSLI 1.5 mg/m 2 1.825 mg/m 2 2.0 mg/m 2 2.25 mg/m 2 2.4 mg/m 2 conducted determine maximum tolerated dose MTD standard 3 3 dose-escalation design Dexamethasone 40 mg given Days 1 4 Days 11 14 4-week cycle Thirty-six adults relapsed/refractory previously treated conventional VCR received 1 dose VSLI MTD VSLI 2.25 mg/m 2 based dose-limiting toxicities grade 3 motor neuropathy grade 4 seizure grade 4 hepatotoxicity 1 patient 2.4 mg/m 2 dose level common toxicities attributed VSLI included peripheral neuropathy 55 constipation 53 complete response CR achieved 7 36 patients 19 based intent-to-treat CR rate 29 14 patients underwent therapy salvage attempt 7 patients achieved CR underwent subsequent allogeneic stem transplantation remission VSLI plus dexamethasone appeared effective salvage therapy option relapsed/refractory phase 2 international multicenter clinical trial assessing efficacy single-agent VSLI second salvage therapy patients previously treated underway,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[61, 5091, 1, 56, 71, 231, 228, 9, 773, 857, 5, 1566, 2018, 286, 1275, 62, 229, 5832, 1, 260, 56, 183, 68, 195, 969, 3, 287, 1, 34, 146, 50, 3171, 56, 2132, 8886, 6424, 7438, 1754, 14005, 16, 8, 20160, 5020, 4483, 7431, 8886, 3583, 17, 1804, 3, 1456, 800, 1, 8886, 187, 9015, 3561, 8, 124, 14, 160, 1, 709, 1262, 14005, 28, 14, 33, 81, 188, 18, 14, 9295, 81, 188, 18, 18, 13, 81, 188, 18, 18, 243, 81, 188, 18, 15, 18, 39, 81, 188, 18, 10, 426, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 75, 8, 260, 27, 27, 61, 1125, 771, 1217, 327, 81, 10, 447, 23, 162, 14, 298, 39, 2, 23, 162, 175, 298, 213, 1, 296, 39, 647, 417, 977, 437, 857, 5, 591, 430, 62, 62, 373, 73, 5, 809, 8886, 103, 28, 506, 14, 61, 1, 14005, 3, 961, 1, 14005, 10, 18, 243, 81, 188, 18, 90, 23, 61, 817, 385, 1, 88, 27, 3482, 1751, 88, 39, 5866, 2, 88, 39, 6667, 4, 14, 69, 296, 28, 3, 18, 39, 81, 188, 18, 61, 301, 3, 96, 186, 385, 3073, 6, 14005, 159, 672, 1751, 614, 2, 4532, 699, 8, 236, 51, 684, 10, 513, 4, 67, 1, 511, 7, 326, 90, 23, 35, 1697, 6, 943, 65, 3, 684, 116, 10, 462, 9, 3, 213, 7, 54, 208, 36, 22, 136, 157, 992, 3448, 294, 1, 67, 7, 54, 513, 8, 684, 208, 706, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 4, 734, 4, 26, 45, 14005, 349, 1217, 2121, 6, 40, 35, 323, 992, 36, 1501, 9, 591, 430, 62, 8, 124, 18, 944, 1570, 38, 160, 1977, 3, 209, 1, 226, 420, 14005, 22, 419, 992, 36, 9, 7, 5, 373, 73, 62, 16, 3948]",1754.0,19708032,Phase 1 multicenter vincristine sulfate liposomes injection dexamethasone adults relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia,25,0.0273224043715847
Role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2009-11-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease, and outcomes vary by patient age, immunophenotype, and clinical, cytogenetic and molecular features. The optimal postremission therapy for adults with ALL remains unclear. Modern treatment strategies use a risk-adapted approach. The extension of 'pediatric-inspired' chemotherapy regimens into young and middle-age adults has improved their outcomes. Regimens that combine tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy have improved the outcomes for patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. Improvements in transplantation technology with better donor matching and better supportive care have made this modality more widely available. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality are greater with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) than with chemotherapy, although relapses are less common. Available data indicate no clear consensus as to whether there is an advantage to allogeneic HCT over modern chemotherapy for adults with ALL with standard risk features while in the first complete remission (CR1).

High-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,2009-01-01,"Although most children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured, certain subsets have a high risk of relapse. Relapse risk can be predicted by early response to therapy, clinical and pharmacogenetic features of the host, and genetic characteristics of leukemic cells. Though early treatment response can be assessed by the peripheral blast cell count after 1 week of single-agent glucocorticoid treatment or percent of bone marrow blasts by morphology after 1 or 2 weeks of multiagent induction treatment, determination of minimal residual disease by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or flow cytometry after 2 to 6 weeks of induction is the most precise and useful measure. Augmented therapy has improved outcome for the poor responders to initial treatment. Infants with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged ALL comprise a very poor-risk group wherein further intensification of chemotherapy causes significant toxicity. Hybrid protocols incorporating drugs effective for acute myeloid leukemia could improve survival, a strategy being tested in international trials. Studies on the biology of MLL-induced leukemogenesis have prompted the development of novel targeted agents, currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2009-11-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with high-risk features has a poor prognosis in adults despite aggressive chemotherapy. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) is a lower toxicity alternative for high-risk patients requiring hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, it has not been widely used for ALL. We conducted a retrospective study of 24 high-risk adult ALL patients who received an RIC regimen of fludarabine (Flu)/melphalan (Mel) prior to allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) between 6/14/02 and 6/15/07 at the City of Hope. Indications for the RIC regimen were: (1) aged 50 years or older (42%), (2) compromised organ function (54%), or (3) recipient of a previous HCT (37.5%). Patients had a median age of 47.5 years and the median follow-up was 28.5 months for living patients. Both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years was 61.5%. Relapse incidence was 21.1% and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 21.5% at 2 years. Chronic graft-versus-host (cGVHD) developed in 86% of evaluable patients. In this series, no significant correlations were made between outcomes and patient age, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, relatedness of donor source, or prior HCT.

We present here the clinical and biologic features of 356 patients treated uniformly on the prospective trial (UKALL XII/ECOG 2993) with the aim of describing the outcome and identifying prognostic factors. Complete remission was obtained in 94% of patients, and 48% survived 5 years. Positivity of blasts for CD1a and lack of expression of CD13 were associated with better survival (P = .01 and < .001, respectively). NOTCH1 and CDKN2A mutations were seen in 61% and 42% of those tested. Complex cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with poorer survival (19% vs 51% at 5 years, P = .006). Central nervous system involvement at diagnosis did not affect survival (47% vs 48%, P = not significant). For 99 patients randomized between autograft and chemotherapy, 5-year survival was 51% in each arm. Patients with a matched sibling donor had superior 5-year survival to those without donors (61% vs 46%, chi(2), P = .02); this was the result of less relapse (25% vs 51% at 5 years, P < .001).

Effect of allopurinol versus urate oxidase on methotrexate pharmacokinetics in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-01-01,"Allopurinol and urate oxidase are both effective in preventing or treating hyperuricemia during remission induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, but to the authors' knowledge, their effects on concomitant anticancer drug therapy have not been compared. The authors compared plasma methotrexate pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received concomitant allopurinol (n = 20) versus those treated with nonrecombinant or recombinant urate oxidase (n = 96) during high-dose methotrexate administration before conventional remission induction therapy. The minimum plasma concentration of uric acid was significantly (P < .0001) lower after urate oxidase treatment than the concentration after allopurinol treatment. Methotrexate clearance was significantly higher (median, 117.1 mL/minute/m(2) vs 91.1 mL/minute/m(2); P = .019) in patients who received urate oxidase. A higher proportion of patients in the allopurinol group had elevated methotrexate plasma concentrations (36% vs 7%; P = .003) and experienced mucositis (45% vs 16%; P = .003) after methotrexate treatment compared with the urate oxidase group. The lower rate of methotrexate clearance in patients who received allopurinol likely reflected a less potent hypouricemic effect of allopurinol, leading to precipitation of uric acid in renal tubules. Hence, during remission induction therapy for lymphoid malignancies, the authors concluded that renally excreted drugs should be monitored closely, especially in patients who are receiving allopurinol.",Comparative Study,3672.0,7.0,Allopurinol urate oxidase effective preventing treating hyperuricemia remission induction therapy lymphoid malignancies authors knowledge effects concomitant anticancer drug therapy compared authors compared plasma methotrexate pharmacokinetics pediatric patients newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia received concomitant allopurinol n 20 versus treated nonrecombinant recombinant urate oxidase n 96 high-dose methotrexate administration conventional remission induction therapy minimum plasma concentration uric acid significantly P .0001 lower urate oxidase treatment concentration allopurinol treatment Methotrexate clearance significantly higher median 117.1 mL/minute/m 2 vs 91.1 mL/minute/m 2 P .019 patients received urate oxidase higher proportion patients allopurinol group elevated methotrexate plasma concentrations 36 vs 7 P .003 experienced mucositis 45 vs 16 P .003 methotrexate treatment compared urate oxidase group lower rate methotrexate clearance patients received allopurinol likely reflected potent hypouricemic effect allopurinol leading precipitation uric acid renal tubules remission induction therapy lymphoid malignancies authors concluded renally excreted drugs monitored closely especially patients receiving allopurinol,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[22090, 2, 20281, 10447, 32, 110, 323, 4, 3017, 15, 1367, 14780, 190, 734, 504, 36, 9, 2303, 441, 84, 6, 3, 738, 922, 136, 176, 23, 1781, 1475, 234, 36, 47, 44, 85, 72, 3, 738, 72, 554, 2116, 1159, 4, 815, 7, 5, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 54, 103, 1781, 22090, 78, 179, 185, 135, 73, 5, 43810, 15, 2835, 20281, 10447, 78, 921, 190, 64, 61, 2116, 634, 348, 809, 734, 504, 36, 3, 2499, 554, 1227, 1, 16387, 971, 10, 97, 19, 488, 280, 50, 20281, 10447, 24, 76, 3, 1227, 50, 22090, 24, 2116, 1960, 10, 97, 142, 52, 3843, 14, 542, 3949, 188, 18, 105, 970, 14, 542, 3949, 188, 18, 19, 4049, 4, 7, 54, 103, 20281, 10447, 8, 142, 920, 1, 7, 4, 3, 22090, 87, 42, 804, 2116, 554, 1003, 511, 105, 67, 19, 1421, 2, 592, 2606, 512, 105, 245, 19, 1421, 50, 2116, 24, 72, 5, 3, 20281, 10447, 87, 3, 280, 116, 1, 2116, 1960, 4, 7, 54, 103, 22090, 322, 4686, 8, 299, 1157, 58335, 254, 1, 22090, 1049, 6, 18912, 1, 16387, 971, 4, 17166, 3665, 190, 734, 504, 36, 9, 2303, 441, 3, 738, 4724, 17, 23124, 14119, 600, 257, 40, 2909, 3210, 1093, 4, 7, 54, 32, 357, 22090]",1507.0,19834958,Effect allopurinol versus urate oxidase methotrexate pharmacokinetics children newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

DNA variants in region for noncoding interfering transcript of dihydrofolate reductase gene and outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-10-27,"Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is the major target of methotrexate, a key component in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. We recently reported an association of DHFR promoter polymorphisms with ALL outcome. Lower event-free survival correlated with haplotype *1, defined by A(-317) and C(-1610) alleles. Haplotype *1 was also associated higher DHFR expression. Here, we analyzed adjacent 400-bp region participating in DHFR regulation as both a major promoter and a noncoding minor transcript. Six polymorphisms were identified, of which five were single nucleotide polymorphisms and one was length polymorphism composed of variable number of 9-bp elements and 9-bp insertion/deletion. Haplotype analysis including all promoter polymorphisms revealed diversification of haplotype *1 into five subtypes (*1a-*1e). DNA variations of major promoter/noncoding transcript region and haplotype *1 subtypes were subsequently analyzed for the association with ALL outcome. Lower event-free survival was associated with an A allele of G(308)A polymorphism (P = 0.02) and with *1b haplotype (P = 0.01). This association was particularly striking in high-risk patients (P = 0.001) and was subsequently confirmed in independent patient cohort (P = 0.02).

Gene expression classifiers for relapse-free survival and minimal residual disease improve risk classification and outcome prediction in pediatric B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2009-10-30,"To determine whether gene expression profiling could improve outcome prediction in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at high risk for relapse, we profiled pretreatment leukemic cells in 207 uniformly treated children with high-risk B-precursor ALL. A 38-gene expression classifier predictive of relapse-free survival (RFS) could distinguish 2 groups with differing relapse risks: low (4-year RFS, 81%, n = 109) versus high (4-year RFS, 50%, n = 98; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the gene expression classifier (P = .001) and flow cytometric measures of minimal residual disease (MRD; P = .001) each provided independent prognostic information. Together, they could be used to classify children with high-risk ALL into low- (87% RFS), intermediate- (62% RFS), or high- (29% RFS) risk groups (P < .001). A 21-gene expression classifier predictive of end-induction MRD effectively substituted for flow MRD, yielding a combined classifier that could distinguish these 3 risk groups at diagnosis (P < .001).

Germline genetic variation in an organic anion transporter polypeptide associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and clinical effects.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-09,"Methotrexate plasma concentration is related to its clinical effects. Our aim was to identify the genetic basis of interindividual variability in methotrexate pharmacokinetics in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed a genome-wide analysis of 500,568 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify how inheritance affects methotrexate plasma disposition among 434 children with ALL who received 3,014 courses of methotrexate at 2 to 5 g/m(2). SNPs were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients. Adjusting for age, race, sex, and methotrexate regimen, the most significant associations were with SNPs in the organic anion transporter polypeptide, SLCO1B1. Two SNPs in SLCO1B1, rs11045879 (P = 1.7 x 10(-10)) and rs4149081 (P = 1.7 x 10(-9)), were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other (r(2) = 1) and with a functional polymorphism in SLCO1B1, T521C (rs4149056; r(2) > 0.84). rs11045879 and rs4149081 were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients (P = .018 and P = .017), as were other SLCO1B1 SNPs residing in different LD blocks. SNPs in SLCO1B1 were also associated with GI toxicity (odds ratio, 15.3 to 16.4; P = .03 to .004).

Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-16,"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often cured, but the therapies they receive may be neurotoxic. Little is known about the incidence and severity of late-occurring neurologic sequelae in ALL survivors. Data were analyzed to determine the incidence of adverse long-term neurologic outcomes and treatment-related risk factors. We analyzed adverse neurologic outcomes that occurred after diagnosis in 4,151 adult survivors of childhood ALL who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a retrospective cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. A randomly selected cohort of the survivors' siblings served as a comparison group. Self-reported auditory-vestibular-visual sensory deficits, focal neurologic dysfunction, seizures, and serious headaches were assessed. The median age at outcome assessment was 20.2 years for survivors. The median follow-up time to death or last survey since ALL diagnosis was 14.1 years. Of the survivors, 64.5% received cranial radiation and 94% received intrathecal chemotherapy. Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors were at elevated risk for late-onset auditory-vestibular-visual sensory deficits (rate ratio [RR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2), coordination problems (RR, 4.1; 95% CI, 3.1 to 5.3), motor problems (RR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.8 to 6.7), seizures (RR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.4 to 6.2), and headaches (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.7).

Here, we show how gene expression profiling identifies high-level MCL-1 expression to be associated with prednisolone resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, as well as in more favorable types of childhood ALL. To validate this observation, we determined MCL-1 expression with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a cohort of MLL-rearranged infant ALL and pediatric noninfant ALL samples and confirmed that high-level MCL-1 expression is associated with prednisolone resistance in vitro. In addition, MCL-1 expression appeared to be significantly higher in MLL-rearranged infant patients who showed a poor response to prednisone in vivo compared with prednisone good responders. Finally, down-regulation of MCL-1 in prednisolone-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by RNA interference, to some extent, led to prednisolone sensitization. Collectively, our findings suggest a potential role for MCL-1 in glucocorticoid resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, but at the same time strongly imply that high-level MCL-1 expression is not the sole mechanism providing resistance to these drugs.",Journal Article,3700.0,52.0,MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents unfavorable type leukemia highly resistant glucocorticoids prednisone dexamethasone response prednisone largely determines clinical outcome pediatric patients overcoming resistance drug important step improving prognosis expression profiling identifies high-level MCL-1 expression associated prednisolone resistance MLL-rearranged infant favorable types childhood validate observation determined MCL-1 expression quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cohort MLL-rearranged infant pediatric noninfant confirmed high-level MCL-1 expression associated prednisolone resistance vitro addition MCL-1 expression appeared significantly higher MLL-rearranged infant patients showed poor response prednisone vivo compared prednisone good responders Finally down-regulation MCL-1 prednisolone-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemia RNA interference extent led prednisolone sensitization Collectively findings suggest potential role MCL-1 glucocorticoid resistance MLL-rearranged infant time strongly imply high-level MCL-1 expression sole mechanism providing resistance drugs,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3049, 3201, 286, 1275, 62, 1449, 35, 2483, 267, 1, 17, 629, 16, 561, 436, 6, 7307, 225, 22, 1979, 2, 1217, 408, 51, 6, 1979, 1733, 9476, 38, 228, 1, 815, 7, 5, 62, 5344, 251, 6, 26, 234, 68, 40, 35, 305, 2458, 1317, 1673, 356, 467, 21, 514, 832, 145, 55, 1080, 2953, 64, 301, 1308, 14, 55, 6, 40, 41, 5, 11253, 251, 4, 3049, 3201, 8027, 62, 22, 149, 22, 4, 80, 913, 630, 1, 864, 62, 6, 2183, 26, 1664, 21, 509, 1308, 14, 55, 5, 1156, 1772, 866, 1451, 1260, 1329, 4, 8, 180, 1, 3049, 3201, 8027, 62, 2, 815, 33724, 62, 347, 2, 557, 17, 64, 301, 1308, 14, 55, 16, 41, 5, 11253, 251, 4, 439, 4, 352, 1308, 14, 55, 2121, 6, 40, 97, 142, 4, 3049, 3201, 8027, 7, 54, 224, 8, 334, 51, 6, 1979, 4, 386, 72, 5, 1979, 1178, 1983, 1368, 1328, 863, 1, 1308, 14, 4, 11253, 436, 3049, 3201, 37, 20, 893, 3182, 6, 476, 1039, 836, 6, 11253, 6272, 2535, 114, 272, 309, 8, 174, 200, 9, 1308, 14, 4, 5399, 251, 4, 3049, 3201, 8027, 62, 84, 28, 3, 827, 98, 1327, 8360, 17, 64, 301, 1308, 14, 55, 16, 44, 3, 4991, 670, 1736, 251, 6, 46, 600]",1443.0,19965632,Association high-level MCL-1 expression vitro vivo prednisone resistance MLL-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Current treatment options for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2010-02-01,"The clinical management of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been challenging primarily due to the aggressive nature of the disease and limited effective treatment options. The outcome for patients who receive conventional chemotherapy alone is poor, with remission duration of around 12 months and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of not more than 10%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been the only known curative treatment option, but is limited by the availability of a matched donor and the risk of treatment-related mortality. Given the role of BCR-ABL in the leukemogenesis of Ph+ ALL, current treatments have focused on inhibition of this oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Early studies demonstrate that the use of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, before alloSCT results in improved response rates and DFS when combined with standard chemotherapy regimens. Remission duration also is improved when combination chemotherapy and imatinib are administered intensively, even in the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, resistant disease remains an important problem, and the mechanisms underlying resistance in Ph+ ALL are multifactorial. Novel TKIs are currently under development and are effective in some patients with imatinib-resistant disease. The dual BCR-ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, has shown promising activity in the treatment of Ph+ ALL after imatinib failure and has recently been approved in this indication. Other TKI-based therapies are also showing potential in imatinib-resistant disease.

Intravenous PEG-asparaginase during remission induction in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2009-12-10,"Over the past several decades, L-asparaginase, an important component of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), has typically been administered intramuscularly rather than intravenously in North America because of concerns regarding anaphylaxis. We evaluated the feasibility of giving polyethylene glycosylated (PEG)-asparaginase, the polyethylene glycol conjugate of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, by intravenous infusion in children with ALL. Between 2005 and 2007, 197 patients (age, 1-17 years) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 05-01 and received a single dose of intravenous PEG-asparaginase (2500 IU/m(2)) over 1 hour during remission induction. Serum asparaginase activity more than 0.1 IU/mL was detected in 95%, 88%, and 7% of patients at 11, 18, and 25 days after dosing, respectively. Toxicities included allergy (1.5%), venous thrombosis (2%), and pancreatitis (4.6%). We conclude that intravenous administration of PEG-asparaginase is tolerable in children with ALL, and potentially therapeutic enzyme activity is maintained for at least 2 weeks after a single dose in most patients.

Functional screening identifies CRLF2 in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2009-12-15,"The prognosis for adults with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains poor, in part from a lack of therapeutic targets. We identified the type I cytokine receptor subunit CRLF2 in a functional screen for B-ALL-derived mRNA transcripts that can substitute for IL3 signaling. We demonstrate that CRLF2 is overexpressed in approximately 15% of adult and high-risk pediatric B-ALL that lack MLL, TCF3, TEL, and BCR/ABL rearrangements, but not in B-ALL with these rearrangements or other lymphoid malignancies. CRLF2 overexpression can result from translocation with the IGH locus or intrachromosomal deletion and is associated with poor outcome. CRLF2 overexpressing B-ALLs share a transcriptional signature that significantly overlaps with a BCR/ABL signature, and is enriched for genes involved in cytokine receptor and JAK-STAT signaling. In a subset of cases, CRLF2 harbors a Phe232Cys gain-of-function mutation that promotes constitutive dimerization and cytokine independent growth. A mutually exclusive subset harbors activating mutations in JAK2. In fact, all 22 B-ALLs with mutant JAK2 that we analyzed overexpress CRLF2, distinguishing CRLF2 as the key scaffold for mutant JAK2 signaling in B-ALL. Expression of WT CRLF2 with mutant JAK2 also promotes cytokine independent growth that, unlike CRLF2 Phe232Cys or ligand-induced signaling by WT CRLF2, is accompanied by JAK2 phosphorylation. Finally, cells dependent on CRLF2 signaling are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of either JAKs or protein kinase C family kinases. Together, these findings implicate CRLF2 as an important factor in B-ALL with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.",Journal Article,3689.0,210.0,prognosis adults precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL remains poor lack therapeutic targets identified type cytokine receptor subunit CRLF2 functional screen B-ALL-derived mRNA transcripts substitute IL3 signaling demonstrate CRLF2 overexpressed approximately 15 adult high-risk pediatric B-ALL lack MLL TCF3 TEL BCR/ABL rearrangements B-ALL rearrangements lymphoid malignancies CRLF2 overexpression translocation IGH locus intrachromosomal deletion associated poor outcome CRLF2 overexpressing B-ALLs share transcriptional signature significantly overlaps BCR/ABL signature enriched involved cytokine receptor JAK-STAT signaling subset cases CRLF2 harbors Phe232Cys gain-of-function promotes constitutive dimerization cytokine independent growth mutually exclusive subset harbors activating JAK2 fact 22 B-ALLs JAK2 overexpress CRLF2 distinguishing CRLF2 key scaffold JAK2 signaling B-ALL Expression WT CRLF2 JAK2 promotes cytokine independent growth unlike CRLF2 Phe232Cys ligand-induced signaling WT CRLF2 accompanied JAK2 phosphorylation Finally dependent CRLF2 signaling sensitive small molecule inhibitors JAKs kinase C family kinases findings implicate CRLF2 important factor B-ALL diagnostic prognostic therapeutic implications,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 356, 9, 857, 5, 2765, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 469, 334, 4, 760, 29, 8, 926, 1, 189, 637, 21, 108, 3, 267, 70, 1675, 153, 3350, 8895, 4, 8, 583, 2413, 9, 132, 62, 526, 956, 2680, 17, 122, 12577, 9, 20283, 314, 21, 608, 17, 8895, 16, 1711, 4, 705, 167, 1, 780, 2, 64, 43, 815, 132, 62, 17, 926, 3049, 25178, 8573, 2, 1062, 1425, 2072, 84, 44, 4, 132, 62, 5, 46, 2072, 15, 127, 2303, 441, 8895, 851, 122, 757, 29, 2006, 5, 3, 5221, 2474, 15, 24924, 1528, 2, 16, 41, 5, 334, 228, 8895, 2810, 132, 10706, 4349, 8, 1431, 1651, 17, 97, 16388, 5, 8, 1062, 1425, 1651, 2, 16, 2220, 9, 214, 646, 4, 1675, 153, 2, 4653, 4168, 314, 4, 8, 697, 1, 140, 8895, 8475, 8, 45801, 1803, 1, 343, 258, 17, 2148, 3178, 7509, 2, 1675, 306, 129, 8, 5575, 4804, 697, 8475, 1616, 138, 4, 2509, 4, 1991, 62, 350, 132, 10706, 5, 620, 2509, 17, 21, 311, 5612, 8895, 4508, 8895, 22, 3, 825, 11547, 9, 620, 2509, 314, 4, 132, 62, 55, 1, 1820, 8895, 5, 620, 2509, 120, 2148, 1675, 306, 129, 17, 4246, 8895, 45801, 15, 1232, 277, 314, 20, 1820, 8895, 16, 2756, 20, 2509, 982, 1368, 37, 470, 23, 8895, 314, 32, 745, 6, 302, 1354, 222, 1, 361, 28197, 15, 178, 216, 256, 607, 1549, 1162, 46, 272, 5545, 8895, 22, 35, 305, 161, 4, 132, 62, 5, 752, 177, 2, 189, 1268]",1649.0,20018760,Functional screening identifies CRLF2 precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,4,0.004371584699453552

Using methylated CpG island amplification/DNA promoter microarray, we identified several EPH receptor and EPHRIN genes as potential hypermethylation targets in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We subsequently studied the DNA methylation status of the Eph/ephrin family by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Hypermethylation of EPHA2, -A4, -A5, -A6, -A7, -A10, EPHB1, -B2, -B3, -B4, EFNA1, -A3, -A5, and EFNB1 and -B2 genes was detected in leukemia cell lines and primary ALL bone marrow samples. Expression analysis of EPHB4, EFNB2, and EFNA5 genes demonstrated that DNA methylation was associated with gene silencing. We cloned the promoter region of EPHB4 and demonstrated that promoter hypermethylation can result in EPHB4 transcriptional silencing. Restoration of EPHB4 expression by lentiviral transduction resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death in Raji cells in which EPHB4 is methylated and silenced. Finally, we demonstrated that phosphorylated Akt is down-regulated in Raji cells transduced with EPHB4. These results suggest that epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of EPH/EPHRIN family genes contributes to ALL pathogenesis and that EPHB4 can function as a tumor suppressor in ALL.",Journal Article,3665.0,65.0,Eph receptors ephrin ligands involved normal hematopoietic development tumorigenesis methylated CpG island amplification/DNA promoter microarray identified EPH receptor EPHRIN potential hypermethylation targets acute lymphoblastic leukemia subsequently studied DNA methylation status Eph/ephrin family bisulfite pyrosequencing Hypermethylation EPHA2 -A4 -A5 -A6 -A7 -A10 EPHB1 -B2 -B3 -B4 EFNA1 -A3 -A5 EFNB1 -B2 detected leukemia lines primary bone marrow Expression EPHB4 EFNB2 EFNA5 demonstrated DNA methylation associated silencing cloned promoter region EPHB4 demonstrated promoter hypermethylation EPHB4 transcriptional silencing Restoration EPHB4 expression lentiviral transduction resulted reduced proliferation apoptotic death Raji EPHB4 methylated silenced Finally demonstrated phosphorylated Akt down-regulated Raji transduced EPHB4 suggest epigenetic silencing hypermethylation EPH/EPHRIN family contributes pathogenesis EPHB4 function suppressor,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[13916, 1186, 2, 136, 8611, 3123, 32, 646, 4, 295, 1007, 193, 2, 1565, 75, 2963, 2075, 3454, 1073, 261, 973, 1727, 21, 108, 392, 13916, 153, 2, 8611, 214, 22, 174, 2575, 637, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 21, 1611, 656, 3, 261, 569, 156, 1, 3, 13916, 8611, 607, 20, 6181, 6031, 2575, 1, 5511, 14090, 39205, 18419, 42796, 26368, 25220, 6617, 12631, 14476, 58543, 7024, 39205, 2, 58544, 2, 6617, 214, 10, 530, 4, 31, 285, 2, 86, 62, 581, 347, 55, 65, 1, 4208, 39206, 2, 39207, 214, 264, 17, 261, 569, 10, 41, 5, 145, 2077, 21, 8560, 3, 973, 1053, 1, 4208, 2, 264, 17, 973, 2575, 122, 757, 4, 4208, 1431, 2077, 5194, 1, 4208, 55, 20, 7823, 2761, 627, 4, 405, 457, 2, 1631, 31, 273, 4, 9868, 37, 4, 92, 4208, 16, 2963, 2, 5442, 1368, 21, 264, 17, 2365, 649, 16, 1328, 1065, 4, 9868, 37, 5042, 5, 4208, 46, 99, 309, 17, 1418, 2077, 20, 2575, 1, 13916, 8611, 607, 214, 2444, 6, 62, 1384, 2, 17, 4208, 122, 343, 22, 8, 30, 1245, 4, 62]",1266.0,20061560,Aberrant DNA methylation epigenetic inactivation Eph receptor tyrosine kinases ephrin ligands acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

Dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice daily in patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who failed imatinib: Results from a phase 3 study.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2010-03-01,"Dasatinib 70 mg twice daily is indicated for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) intolerant or resistant to imatinib. In patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, once-daily dosing has similar efficacy with improved safety, compared with twice-daily dosing. A phase 3 study (n = 611) assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice-daily in patients with advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Here, results from the Ph+ ALL subset (n = 84) with a 2-year follow-up are reported. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib either 140 mg once daily (n = 40) or 70 mg twice daily (n = 44). The rate of confirmed major hematologic response with once-daily dosing (38%) was similar to that with twice-daily dosing (32%). The rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had longer progression-free survival (median, 3.0 months versus 4.0 months, respectively) and shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively). Overall safety profiles were similar between two groups, with nonhematologic adverse events being mostly grade 1 or 2. Pleural effusion was less frequent with once-daily dosing than with twice-daily dosing (all grades, 18% versus 32%).

Each of the 29 cases harbored a genomic rearrangement of CRLF2: 18 of 29 (62%) had a translocation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene IGH@ on 14q32 to CRLF2 in the pseudoautosomal region 1 of Xp22.3/Yp11.3, whereas 10 (34%) cases had a 320-kb interstitial deletion centromeric of CRLF2, resulting in a P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion. One case had both IGH@-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2, and another had a novel CRLF2 rearrangement. Only 2 of 29 cases were Down syndrome. CRLF2 rearrangements were significantly associated with activating mutations of JAK1 or JAK2, deletion or mutation of IKZF1, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (Fisher exact test, P < .001 for each). Within this cohort, patients with CRLF2 rearrangements had extremely poor treatment outcomes compared with those without CRLF2 rearrangements (35.3% vs 71.3% relapse-free survival at 4 years; P < .001).

Also, we investigated expression of CDKN2A/B and the apoptosis in U937 cells when hCLP46 is downregulated in vitro. Our findings showed that hCLP46 was overexpressed in AML, T-ALL, and the leukemic cell lines. Suppressing hCLP46 overexpression had no effect on expression of CDKN2A/B and apoptosis of U937 cells.

Central nervous system prophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: current and emerging therapies.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-05-01,"Central nervous system (CNS) recurrence continues to be a significant complication in the treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Preventing CNS recurrence has been a therapeutic challenge and has not been addressed critically in many clinical trials. Adult studies modeled on childhood ALL studies have used multiple treatment modalities, including radiation therapy, systemic therapy, intrathecal therapy, and combinations thereof. Cranial irradiation is effective but is offset by substantial toxicity, including neurologic sequelae. Systemic chemotherapy, especially with cytarabine (AraC) and methotrexate, has demonstrated promise in decreasing CNS recurrence, but therapeutic levels of drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are not maintained. Intrathecal chemotherapy with or without high-dose systemic therapy is the most common approach to CNS prophylaxis. Liposomal AraC recently has become available and confers prolonged levels of free AraC in the CSF, a critical requirement for CNS prophylactic therapy.

Of the 455 clinical samples studied on day 46 of therapy, 139 (30.5%) had MRD 0.001% or more with 63 of these (45.3%) showing levels of 0.001% to less than 0.01%, whereas 316 (69.5%) had levels that were either less than 0.001% or undetectable. MRD measurements of 0.001% to less than 0.01% were not significantly related to presenting characteristics but were associated with a poorer leukemia cell clearance on day 19 of remission induction therapy. Patients with this low level of MRD had a 12.7% (+/- 5.1%; SE) cumulative risk of relapse at 5 years, compared with 5.0% (+/- 1.5%) for those with lower or undetectable MRD (P < .047). Thus, low levels of MRD (0.001%-< 0.01%) at the end of remission induction therapy have prognostic significance in childhood ALL, suggesting that patients with this finding should be monitored closely for adverse events.",Comparative Study,3595.0,95.0,Minimal residual disease MRD end remission-induction therapy predicts relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia examined clinical significance levels usual threshold value MRD positivity 0.01 455 children B-lineage polymerase chain reaction amplification antigen-receptor capable detecting 1 leukemic 100 000 normal mononucleated 0.001 455 clinical studied day 46 therapy 139 30.5 MRD 0.001 63 45.3 showing levels 0.001 0.01 316 69.5 levels 0.001 undetectable MRD measurements 0.001 0.01 significantly related presenting characteristics associated poorer leukemia clearance day 19 remission induction therapy Patients low level MRD 12.7 +/- 5.1 SE cumulative risk relapse 5 years compared 5.0 +/- 1.5 lower undetectable MRD P .047 low levels MRD 0.001 0.01 end remission induction therapy prognostic significance childhood suggesting patients finding monitored closely adverse events,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1048, 753, 34, 2029, 28, 3, 396, 1, 734, 504, 36, 2623, 429, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 21, 409, 3, 38, 724, 1, 148, 2736, 3, 3521, 2390, 549, 9, 2029, 1887, 13, 355, 4, 10997, 541, 5, 132, 2542, 62, 75, 1451, 1260, 1329, 1073, 1, 448, 153, 214, 2787, 1, 2502, 28, 506, 14, 2015, 31, 379, 394, 984, 295, 58763, 37, 13, 144, 1, 3, 10997, 38, 347, 656, 23, 218, 641, 1, 36, 4929, 201, 33, 42, 2029, 13, 144, 15, 80, 5, 676, 1, 46, 512, 27, 2069, 148, 1, 13, 144, 6, 299, 76, 13, 355, 547, 8500, 790, 33, 42, 148, 17, 11, 361, 299, 76, 13, 144, 15, 3920, 2029, 1685, 1, 13, 144, 6, 299, 76, 13, 355, 11, 44, 97, 139, 6, 1656, 374, 84, 11, 41, 5, 8, 1769, 31, 1960, 23, 218, 326, 1, 734, 504, 36, 7, 5, 26, 154, 301, 1, 2029, 42, 8, 133, 67, 33, 14, 3428, 967, 43, 1, 429, 28, 33, 60, 72, 5, 33, 13, 14, 33, 9, 135, 5, 280, 15, 3920, 2029, 19, 5296, 631, 154, 148, 1, 2029, 13, 144, 13, 355, 28, 3, 396, 1, 734, 504, 36, 47, 177, 724, 4, 864, 62, 802, 17, 7, 5, 26, 1567, 257, 40, 2909, 3210, 9, 290, 281]",1222.0,20304809,Clinical significance low levels minimal residual disease end remission induction therapy childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,4,0.004371584699453552
Infant leukemia and parental infertility or its treatment: a Children's Oncology Group report.,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",Hum. Reprod.,2010-04-10,"Little is known about the potential risk factors for infant leukemia. With its very young age at diagnosis, exposures occurring in the perinatal period are suspected. Parental infertility and infertility treatment have been studied with regard to childhood cancer in general, but rarely in individual cancer subtypes. A case-control study of infant leukemia was conducted through the Children's Oncology Group, including cases diagnosed from January 1996 to December 2006 and controls selected through random digit dialing and birth certificate tracing. Maternal phone interviews were conducted to obtain information about infertility, infertility treatment and demographic factors. All cases as well as subgroups defined by mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation status and leukemia subtype were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression models. No significant associations between infertility or its treatment and combined infant leukemia were found. In subgroup analyses, there was a significant increase in the risk of MLL--leukemia for children born to women not trying to conceive compared with those trying for <1 year for all types combined [odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-2.59] and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.36-4.61). There were no positive associations between parental infertility or infertility treatment and infant leukemia. While this is the largest study to date, both selection and recall bias may have impacted the results. However, for infant leukemia, we can potentially rule out large increases in risk associated with parental infertility or its treatment.",Journal Article,3573.0,,Little known potential risk factors infant leukemia young age diagnosis exposures occurring perinatal period suspected Parental infertility infertility treatment studied regard childhood general rarely individual subtypes case-control infant leukemia conducted Children 's Oncology Group including cases diagnosed January 1996 December 2006 controls selected random digit dialing birth certificate tracing Maternal phone interviews conducted obtain information infertility infertility treatment demographic factors cases subgroups defined mixed lineage leukemia MLL translocation status leukemia subtype examined Statistical performed multivariate logistic regression models significant associations infertility treatment combined infant leukemia subgroup significant increase risk MLL -- leukemia children born women trying conceive compared trying 1 year types combined odds ratio 1.62 95 confidence interval CI 1.01-2.59 acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2.50 95 CI 1.36-4.61 positive associations parental infertility infertility treatment infant leukemia largest date selection recall bias impacted infant leukemia potentially rule large increases risk associated parental infertility treatment,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1215, 16, 440, 545, 3, 174, 43, 130, 9, 8027, 5, 211, 923, 1169, 89, 28, 147, 3401, 1821, 4, 3, 29004, 727, 32, 2768, 3418, 5901, 2, 5901, 24, 47, 85, 656, 5, 2539, 6, 864, 12, 4, 1083, 84, 2416, 4, 797, 12, 814, 8, 473, 182, 45, 1, 8027, 10, 426, 298, 3, 541, 292, 413, 87, 141, 140, 265, 29, 1024, 2648, 6, 1397, 1324, 2, 535, 715, 298, 2324, 9553, 14758, 2, 3809, 17216, 15457, 6039, 8772, 4053, 11, 426, 6, 3140, 487, 545, 5901, 5901, 24, 2, 1540, 130, 62, 140, 22, 149, 22, 1453, 395, 20, 1739, 2542, 3049, 2006, 156, 2, 875, 11, 409, 1050, 65, 10, 173, 75, 331, 812, 320, 274, 77, 93, 685, 59, 5901, 15, 211, 24, 2, 397, 8027, 11, 204, 4, 1363, 318, 125, 10, 8, 93, 344, 4, 3, 43, 1, 3049, 9, 541, 8234, 6, 117, 44, 14453, 6, 34874, 72, 5, 135, 14453, 9, 14, 111, 9, 62, 630, 397, 610, 197, 15, 14, 744, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 355, 18, 728, 2, 9, 286, 1275, 15, 18, 212, 48, 58, 14, 511, 39, 713, 125, 11, 77, 109, 685, 59, 3418, 5901, 15, 5901, 24, 2, 8027, 369, 26, 16, 3, 2166, 45, 6, 1244, 110, 881, 2, 6169, 2947, 68, 47, 4619, 3, 99, 137, 9, 8027, 21, 122, 751, 5340, 1205, 375, 1106, 4, 43, 41, 5, 3418, 5901, 15, 211, 24]",1561.0,20382971,Infant leukemia parental infertility treatment Children 's Oncology Group report,2,0.002185792349726776

The outcome of full-intensity and reduced-intensity conditioning matched sibling or unrelated donor transplantation in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first and second complete remission.,Blood,Blood,2010-04-19,"We examined the efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and compared outcomes of 93 patients older than 16 years after RIC with 1428 patients receiving full-intensity conditioning for allografts using sibling and unrelated donors for Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remission. RIC conditioning included busulfan 9 mg/kg or less (27), melphalan 150 mg/m(2) or less (23), low-dose total body irradiation (TBI; 36), and others (7). The RIC group was older (median 45 vs 28 years, P < .001) and more received peripheral blood grafts (73% vs 43%, P < .001) but had similar other prognostic factors. The RIC versus full-intensity conditioning groups had slightly, but not significantly, less acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease (39% vs 46%) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (34% vs 42%), yet similar transplantation-related mortality. RIC led to slightly more relapse (35% vs 26%, P = .08) yet similar age-adjusted survival (38% vs 43%, P = .39). Multivariate analysis showed that conditioning intensity did not affect transplantation-related mortality (P = .92) or relapse risk (P = .14). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significantly improved overall survival with: Karnofsky performance status more than 80, first complete remission, lower white blood count, well-matched unrelated or sibling donors, transplantation since 2001, age younger than 30 years, and conditioning with TBI, but no independent impact of conditioning intensity.

"Deficient innate immunity, thymopoiesis, and gene expression response to radiation in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2010-04-22,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at an increased risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms. Radiation and chemotherapy can cause mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities and induce genomic instability. Host immunity and appropriate DNA damage responses are critical inhibitors of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine the long-term effects of ALL treatment on immune function and response to DNA damage. Comparative studies on 14 survivors in first complete remission and 16 siblings were conducted. In comparison to siblings on the cells that were involved in adaptive immunity, the patients had either higher numbers (CD19+ B cells and CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells) or similar numbers (alphabetaT cells and CD45RO+/RA- memory T cells) in the blood. In contrast, patients had lower numbers of all lymphocyte subsets involved in innate immunity (gammadeltaT cells and all NK subsets, including KIR2DL1+ cells, KIR2DL2/L3+ cells, and CD16+ cells), and lower natural cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia cells. Thymopoiesis was lower in patients, as demonstrated by less CD45RO-/RA+ naïve T cell and less SjTREC levels in the blood, whereas the Vbeta spectratype complexity score was similar. Array of gene expression response to low-dose radiation showed that about 70% of the probesets had a reduced response in patients.

Non-CNS cancer survivors and siblings were compared with multivariable linear regression and log-binomial regression. Among survivors, log-binomial models assessed the association of patient and treatment factors with neurocognitive dysfunction. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Non-CNS cancer survivors had similar or slightly worse (<0.5 standard deviation) mean test scores for all four subscales than siblings. However, frequencies of impaired survivors were approximately 50% higher than siblings in task efficiency (13.0% of survivors vs 7.3% of siblings), memory (12.5% vs 7.6%), and emotional regulation (21.2% vs 14.4%). Impaired task efficiency was most often identified in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received cranial radiation therapy (18.1% with impairment), myeloid leukemia who received cranial radiation therapy (21.2%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13.9%). In adjusted analysis, diagnosis age of younger than 6 years, female sex, cranial radiation therapy, and hearing impairment were associated with impairment.

Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of a novel schedule of flavopiridol in relapsed or refractory acute leukemias.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2010-05-11,"A pharmacokinetically derived schedule of flavopiridol administered as a 30 min intravenous bolus followed by 4-hour continuous intravenous infusion (IVB/CIVI) is active in fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but no studies examining the feasibility and maximum tolerated dose of this schedule have been reported in acute leukemia. We conducted a phase I dose escalation trial of single-agent flavopiridol in adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, utilizing a modification of the intravenous bolus/continuous intravenous infusion approach, intensifying treatment for administration on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21-day cycles. Twenty-four adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=19) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=5) were enrolled. The median age was 62 years (range, 23-78). The maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol was 40 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus plus 60 mg/m(2) continuous intravenous infusion (40/60). The dose limiting toxicity was secretory diarrhea. Life-threatening hyperacute tumor lysis syndrome requiring hemodialysis on day 1 was observed in one patient. Pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent with increased clearance observed at the two highest dose levels. Diarrhea occurrence and severity significantly correlated with flavopiridol concentrations at the end of the 4-hour infusion, volume of distribution, and elimination half-life. Modest anti-leukemic activity was observed, with most patients experiencing dramatic but transient reduction/clearance of circulating blasts lasting for 10-14 days. One refractory acute myeloid leukemia patient had short-lived complete remission with incomplete count recovery. Flavopiridol as a single agent given by intravenous bolus/continuous intravenous infusion causes marked, immediate cytoreduction in relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, but objective clinical responses were uncommon.

First report of phase 2 study of dasatinib with hyper-CVAD for the frontline treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2010-05-13,"The combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and imatinib has improved the outcome for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Dasatinib has significant clinical activity in patients with imatinib resistance. We examined the efficacy and safety of combining chemotherapy with dasatinib for patients with Ph(+) ALL. Newly diagnosed patients received dasatinib 50 mg by mouth twice per day (or 100 mg daily) for the first 14 days of each of 8 cycles of alternating hyper-CVAD, and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission received maintenance daily dasatinib and monthly vincristine and prednisone for 2 years, followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Thirty-five patients with untreated Ph(+) ALL with a median age of 53 years (range, 21-79 years) were treated; 33 patients (94%) achieved complete remission. Two patients died of infections before response assessment. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included hemorrhage and pleural and pericardial effusions. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 4-37 months), the median disease-free survival and median overall survival have not been reached, with an estimated 2-year survival of 64%.

The novel deacetylase inhibitor AR-42 demonstrates pre-clinical activity in B-cell malignancies in vitro and in vivo.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-06-03,"While deacetylase (DAC) inhibitors show promise for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, those introduced to date are weak inhibitors of class I and II DACs or potent inhibitors of class I DAC only, and have shown suboptimal activity or unacceptable toxicities. We therefore investigated the novel DAC inhibitor AR-42 to determine its efficacy in B-cell malignancies. In mantle cell lymphoma (JeKo-1), Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (697) cell lines, the 48-hr IC(50) (50% growth inhibitory concentration) of AR-42 is 0.61 microM or less. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient cells, the 48-hr LC(50) (concentration lethal to 50%) of AR-42 is 0.76 microM. AR-42 produces dose- and time-dependent acetylation both of histones and tubulin, and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis that is not reduced in the presence of stromal cells. AR-42 also sensitizes CLL cells to TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), potentially through reduction of c-FLIP. AR-42 significantly reduced leukocyte counts and/or prolonged survival in three separate mouse models of B-cell malignancy without evidence of toxicity. Together, these data demonstrate that AR-42 has in vitro and in vivo efficacy at tolerable doses.

The synthetic heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor EC141 induces degradation of Bcr-Abl p190 protein and apoptosis of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2010-06-09,"The prognosis of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is poor. Chemotherapy is rarely curative and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) induce only transient responses. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a chaperone protein that is important in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and transcription regulation in both normal and leukemia cells. In the current study, we tested the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of a novel Hsp90 inhibitor, EC141 on the Ph+ ALL lines Z-119, Z-181, and Z-33, as well as primary bone marrow-derived blasts from patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL. We found that EC141 inhibited the growth of Ph+ ALL cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC(50) ranged from 1 to 10 nM. EC141 also inhibited the proliferation of primary bone marrow-derived blasts using the ALL blast colony assay. EC141 down-regulated Hsp90 and up-regulated Hsp70 protein levels, inhibited CrkL phosphorylation, and induced degradation of Bcr-Abl p190 protein through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway.

Attention and working memory abilities in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-10-01,"To extend investigation beyond global cognitive measures prevalent in the literature, this study examined attention and working memory (WM) abilities of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the separate contributions of attention and WM to intelligence quotient (IQ), and their association with neuroimaging changes. Ninety-seven children with ALL received risk-directed therapy based on presenting clinical and biological factors. During consolidation therapy, low-risk patients received half the dose of intravenous methotrexate that standard-risk/high-risk patients received, and fewer doses of triple intrathecal therapy. Patients were classified according to end of consolidation magnetic resonance imaging scans (normal or leukoencephalopathy), and continuous measures of white matter structure were computed. As part of the protocol study, children completed cognitive assessment 2 years later (completion of therapy), using Digit Span Forward (DSF) for attention and Digit Span Backward (DSB) for WM. For the total sample and the standard-/high-risk group, Total Digit Span (TDS), DSF, and DSB were impaired relative to norms (P<.05). In the low-risk group, only DSB was impaired (P<.0001). Across groups, a higher percentage of patients performed below the average range (scale score<7) on DSB (66%) compared with the DSF (14%) or TDS (18%). Regression analysis indicated that DSB predicted estimated IQ (P<.05), after accounting for DSF. Leukoencephalopathy was predictive of lower TDS (P<.05).

Improved outcome with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a poor prognostic subgroup of infants with mixed-lineage-leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results from the Interfant-99 Study.,Blood,Blood,2010-06-30,"To define a role for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rearrangements of the mixed-lineage-leukemia gene (MLL(+)), we compared the outcome of MLL(+) patients from trial Interfant-99 who either received chemotherapy only or HSCT. Of 376 patients with a known MLL status in the trial, 297 (79%) were MLL(+). Among the 277 of 297 MLL(+) patients (93%) in first remission (CR), there appeared to be a significant difference in disease-free survival (adjusted by waiting time to HSCT) between the 37 (13%) who received HSCT and the 240 (87%) who received chemotherapy only (P = .03). However, the advantage was restricted to a subgroup with 2 additional unfavorable prognostic features: age less than 6 months and either poor response to steroids at day 8 or leukocytes more than or equal to 300 g/L. Ninety-seven of 297 MLL(+) patients (33%) had such high-risk criteria, with 87 achieving CR. In this group, HSCT was associated with a 64% reduction in the risk of failure resulting from relapse or death in CR (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.86). In the remaining patients, there was no advantage for HSCT over chemotherapy only.

Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for acute leukemia in relapse or primary induction failure.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-07-12,"Patients with acute leukemia refractory to induction or reinduction chemotherapy have poor prognoses if they do not undergo hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). However, HSCT when a patient is not in complete remission (CR) is of uncertain benefit. We hypothesized that pretransplantation variables may define subgroups that have a better prognosis. Overall, 2,255 patients who underwent transplantation for acute leukemia in relapse or with primary induction failure after myeloablative conditioning regimen between 1995 and 2004 were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The median follow-up of survivors was 61 months. We performed multivariate analysis of pretransplantation variables and developed a predictive scoring system for survival. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 19% for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 16% for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For AML, five adverse pretransplantation variables significantly influenced survival: first CR duration less than 6 months, circulating blasts, donor other than HLA-identical sibling, Karnofsky or Lansky score less than 90, and poor-risk cytogenetics. For ALL, survival was worse with the following: first refractory or second or greater relapse, > or = 25% marrow blasts, cytomegalovirus-seropositive donor, and age of 10 years or older.

Absence of biallelic TCRgamma deletion predicts early treatment failure in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-07-19,"To identify children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) at high risk of induction chemotherapy failure by using DNA copy number analysis of leukemic cells collected at diagnosis. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from diagnostic lymphoblasts from 47 children with T-ALL treated on Children's Oncology Group Study P9404 or Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Protocol 00-01. These samples represented nine patients who did not achieve an initial complete remission, 13 who relapsed, and 25 who became long-term, event-free survivors. The findings were confirmed in an independent cohort of patients by quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction (DNA-PCR), an assay that is well suited for clinical application. Analysis of the CGH findings in patients in whom induction chemotherapy failed compared with those in whom induction chemotherapy was successful identified the absence of biallelic TCRgamma locus deletion (ABD), a characteristic of early thymocyte precursors before V(D)J recombination, as the most robust predictor of induction failure (P < .001). This feature was also associated with markedly inferior event-free (P = .002) and overall survival (P < .001) rates: 25% versus 58% and 25% versus 72%, respectively. Using a rapid and inexpensive quantitative DNA-PCR assay, we validated ABD as a predictor of a poor response to induction chemotherapy in an independent series of patients. Lymphoblasts from children with T-ALL should be evaluated at diagnosis for deletion within the TCRgamma locus.

Chemoimmunotherapy with a modified hyper-CVAD and rituximab regimen improves outcome in de novo Philadelphia chromosome-negative precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-07-26,"The adverse prognosis of CD20 expression in adults with de novo precursor B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prompted incorporation of monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab into the intensive chemotherapy regimen hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone). Other modifications (irrespective of CD20 expression) included early anthracycline intensification, alterations in number of risk-adapted intrathecal chemotherapy treatments for CNS prophylaxis, additional early and late intensifications, and extension of maintenance phase chemotherapy by 6 months. Two hundred eighty-two adolescents and adults with de novo Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative precursor B-lineage ALL were treated with standard or modified hyper-CVAD regimens. The latter incorporated standard-dose rituximab if CD20 expression > or = 20%. The complete remission (CR) rate was 95% with 3-year rates of CR duration (CRD) and survival (OS) of 60% and 50%, respectively. In the younger (age < 60 years) CD20-positive subset, rates of CRD and OS were superior with the modified hyper-CVAD and rituximab regimens compared with standard hyper-CVAD (70% v 38%; P < .001% and 75% v 47%, P = .003). In contrast, rates of CRD and OS for CD20-negative counterparts treated with modified versus standard hyper-CVAD regimens were similar (72% v 68%, P = not significant [NS] and 64% v 65%, P = NS, respectively). Older patients with CD20-positive ALL did not benefit from rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy (rates of CRD 45% v 50%, P = NS and OS 28% v 32%, P = NS, respectively), related in part to deaths in CR.

Histone H4 acetylation by immunohistochemistry and prognosis in newly diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2010-07-21,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a novel anti-tumor therapy. To determine whether HDAC inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the acetylation of histone H4 by immunohistochemistry in newly diagnosed ALL patients and evaluated the impact of acetylation on complete remission (CR) rate, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients > or = 18 years of age and an available diagnostic bone marrow biopsy were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify univariate and multivariate correlates of CR, RFS, and OS. The variables histone H4 acetylation (positive or negative), white blood count, cytogenetic (CG) risk group (CALGB criteria), and age were used in multivariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, histone acetylation was associated with a trend towards an improved OS (for all CG risk groups) (HR = 0.51, p = 0.09). In patients without poor risk CG, there was an impressive association between the presence of histone acetylation and an improved CR rate (OR 3.43, p = 0.035), RFS (HR 0.07, p = 0.005), and OS (HR 0.24, p = 0.007).

One-antigen mismatched related versus HLA-matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adults with acute leukemia: Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research results in the era of molecular HLA typing.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-07-30,"Approximately 13% of patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling have a one-antigen-mismatched related donor (MMRD). Historically, outcomes from the use of a one-antigen MMRD were considered equivalent to those from the use of a matched unrelated donor (UD). Recent improvements in UD stem cell transplantation (SCT) resulting from better molecular HLA matching justifies investigating whether UD should be preferred over MMRD in adult patients with acute leukemia. Here, we compared the outcomes of MMRD (n = 89) and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 allele-matched UD (n = 700) SCT reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research between 1995 and 2005. The patients underwent transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission. Donor type was not associated with hematologic recovery. Univariate and multivariate comparisons of MMRD versus HLA-matched UD transplants showed no statistically significant differences in overall survival, disease-free survival, treatment-related mortality, relapse, or 100-day grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Expression profiles were correlated with genome-wide DNA copy number abnormalities and clinical and outcome features. Unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiling data revealed 8 unique cluster groups within these high-risk ALL patients, 2 of which were associated with known chromosomal translocations (t(1;19)(TCF3-PBX1) or MLL), and 6 of which lacked any previously known cytogenetic lesion. One unique cluster was characterized by high expression of distinct outlier genes AGAP1, CCNJ, CHST2/7, CLEC12A/B, and PTPRM; ERG DNA deletions; and 4-year relapse-free survival of 94.7% ± 5.1%, compared with 63.5% ± 3.7% for the cohort (P = .01). A second cluster, characterized by high expression of BMPR1B, CRLF2, GPR110, and MUC4; frequent deletion of EBF1, IKZF1, RAG1-2, and IL3RA-CSF2RA; JAK mutations and CRLF2 rearrangements (P < .0001); and Hispanic ethnicity (P < .001) had a very poor 4-year relapse-free survival (21.0% ± 9.5%; P < .001).

A pathway-based gene signature correlates with therapeutic response in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-08-20,"Biomarkers to predict response to therapy in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are not yet established. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of earlier genome-wide gene expression studies to identify pathway-based genes that are associated with therapeutic response. The predictive power of these genes was validated by transcript profiling in diagnostic bone marrow samples from Ph+ ALL patients using a quantitative real-time PCR array. Gene expression was correlated with cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including presence of ABL1 mutations and IKZF1 deletion. A total of 43 de novo Ph+ ALL patients treated uniformly with tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with chemotherapy were selected to validate 46 identified genes. A 9-gene signature was established to distinguish optimal responders from patients with persistent residual disease and early molecular recurrence. The signature was subsequently validated with 87% predictive accuracy in an independent validation set of patients. When initially optimal responders relapsed, their gene expression patterns also shifted. Optimal responders showed upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis pathways, whereas poor responders had higher expression of genes that facilitate tumor cell survival in hypoxic conditions as well as development of drug resistance. This unique 9-gene signature may better enable stratification of patients to proper therapeutic regimens and provides new insights into mechanisms of Ph+ ALL response to therapy.",Journal Article,3441.0,6.0,Biomarkers predict response therapy adults Philadelphia chromosome-positive Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia established performed meta-analysis earlier genome-wide expression studies identify pathway-based associated therapeutic response predictive power validated transcript profiling diagnostic bone marrow Ph+ patients quantitative real-time PCR array expression correlated cytogenetic molecular characteristics including presence ABL1 IKZF1 deletion total 43 novo Ph+ patients treated uniformly tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined chemotherapy selected validate 46 identified 9-gene signature established distinguish optimal responders patients persistent residual disease early molecular recurrence signature subsequently validated 87 predictive accuracy independent validation set patients initially optimal responders relapsed expression patterns shifted Optimal responders showed upregulation involved proliferation apoptosis pathways poor responders higher expression facilitate survival hypoxic conditions development drug resistance unique 9-gene signature better enable stratification patients proper therapeutic regimens provides new insights mechanisms Ph+ response therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[582, 6, 678, 51, 6, 36, 4, 857, 5, 3006, 1170, 109, 2058, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 44, 1145, 635, 4, 26, 45, 21, 173, 8, 1742, 65, 1, 1677, 898, 1019, 145, 55, 94, 6, 255, 308, 90, 214, 17, 32, 41, 5, 189, 51, 3, 464, 2349, 1, 46, 214, 10, 938, 20, 3268, 1080, 4, 752, 581, 347, 29, 2058, 62, 7, 75, 8, 1156, 1589, 98, 604, 1926, 145, 55, 10, 438, 5, 1266, 2, 219, 374, 141, 463, 1, 3557, 138, 2, 8422, 1528, 8, 181, 1, 601, 1566, 2018, 2058, 62, 7, 73, 4254, 5, 564, 216, 222, 397, 5, 56, 11, 715, 6, 2183, 641, 108, 214, 8, 83, 145, 1651, 10, 635, 6, 3081, 665, 1983, 29, 7, 5, 1882, 753, 34, 2, 191, 219, 146, 3, 1651, 10, 1611, 938, 5, 912, 464, 1190, 4, 35, 306, 929, 916, 1, 7, 198, 1625, 665, 1983, 591, 136, 145, 55, 764, 120, 7289, 665, 1983, 224, 2218, 1, 214, 646, 4, 457, 2, 351, 460, 547, 334, 1983, 42, 142, 55, 1, 214, 17, 1876, 30, 31, 25, 4, 4744, 1298, 22, 149, 22, 193, 1, 234, 251, 26, 991, 83, 145, 1651, 68, 380, 3047, 1541, 1, 7, 6, 4576, 189, 472, 2, 777, 217, 1957, 237, 483, 1, 2058, 62, 51, 6, 36]",1549.0,20729815,pathway-based signature correlates therapeutic response adult patients Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
L-asparaginase treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a focus on Erwinia asparaginase.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-09-07,"Asparaginases are a cornerstone of treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are used for remission induction and intensification treatment in all pediatric regimens and in the majority of adult treatment protocols. Extensive clinical data have shown that intensive asparaginase treatment improves clinical outcomes in childhood ALL. Three asparaginase preparations are available: the native asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli asparaginase), a pegylated form of this enzyme (PEG-asparaginase), and a product isolated from Erwinia chrysanthemi, ie, Erwinia asparaginase. Clinical hypersensitivity reactions and silent inactivation due to antibodies against E. coli asparaginase, lead to inactivation of E. coli asparaginase in up to 60% of cases. Current treatment protocols include E. coli asparaginase or PEG-asparaginase for first-line treatment of ALL. Typically, patients exhibiting sensitivity to one formulation of asparaginase are switched to another to ensure they receive the most efficacious treatment regimen possible. Erwinia asparaginase is used as a second- or third-line treatment in European and US protocols. Despite the universal inclusion of asparaginase in such treatment protocols, debate on the optimal formulation and dosage of these agents continues.

The controversy of varicella vaccination in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-09-16,"The available guidelines for varicella vaccination of susceptible children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have become increasingly conservative. However, vaccination of those who have remained in continuous complete remission for 1 year and are receiving chemotherapy is still considered a reasonable option. There is little available data to allow a comparison of the risk versus benefit of vaccinating these patients. We retrospectively reviewed mortality due to varicella in the records of 15 pediatric ALL study groups throughout Europe, Asia, and North America during the period 1984-2008. We found that 20 of 35,128 children with ALL (0.057%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.037-0.088%) died of VZV infection.

Clinical outcome of children with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated between 1995 and 2005.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-09-27,"In a previous analysis of 326 children with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated between 1986 and 1996, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation from HLA-matched related donors, but not from unrelated donors, offered a superior outcome than chemotherapy alone. To evaluate the impact of recent improvements in chemotherapy and transplantation, we performed a similar analysis on patients treated in the following decade. We analyzed 610 patients with Ph-positive ALL treated between 1995 and 2005 without tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. The median follow-up duration was 6.3 years. Complete remission was achieved in 89% of patients. The 7-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were superior in the present cohort compared with the previous cohort (32.0% ± 2.0% v 25.0% ± 3.0, respectively, P = .007; and 44.9% ± 2.2% v 36.0% ± 3.0%, respectively, P = .017). Compared with chemotherapy alone, transplantation with matched related donors or unrelated donors in first remission (325 patients) showed an advantage with increasing follow-up, suggesting greater protection against late relapses (hazard ratio at 5 years, 0.37; P < .001). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis accounting for treatment (transplantation v no transplantation), age, leukocyte count, and early response had independent impact on treatment outcome. Clinical outcome of children and adolescents with Ph-positive ALL has improved with advances in transplantation and chemotherapy. Transplantations with matched related donors and unrelated donors were equivalent and offered better disease control compared with chemotherapy alone. Age, leukocyte count, and early treatment response were independent prognostic indicators. The results of this study will serve as a historical reference to evaluate the therapeutic impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the outcome of Ph-positive ALL.",Journal Article,3403.0,127.0,previous 326 children Philadelphia chromosome Ph -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated 1986 1996 hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation HLA-matched related donors unrelated donors offered superior outcome chemotherapy evaluate impact recent improvements chemotherapy transplantation performed similar patients treated following decade 610 patients Ph-positive treated 1995 2005 tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy median follow-up duration 6.3 years Complete remission achieved 89 patients 7-year event-free survival overall survival rates superior present cohort compared previous cohort 32.0 ± 2.0 v 25.0 ± 3.0 respectively P .007 44.9 ± 2.2 v 36.0 ± 3.0 respectively P .017 Compared chemotherapy transplantation matched related donors unrelated donors remission 325 patients showed advantage increasing follow-up suggesting greater protection late relapses hazard ratio 5 years 0.37 P .001 multivariate Cox regression accounting treatment transplantation v transplantation age leukocyte count early response independent impact treatment outcome Clinical outcome children adolescents Ph-positive improved advances transplantation chemotherapy Transplantations matched related donors unrelated donors equivalent offered better disease control compared chemotherapy Age leukocyte count early treatment response independent prognostic indicators serve historical reference evaluate therapeutic impact tyrosine kinase inhibitors outcome Ph-positive,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 8, 698, 65, 1, 9588, 541, 5, 3006, 1170, 2058, 109, 286, 1275, 62, 73, 59, 3751, 2, 2648, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 29, 1160, 655, 139, 2344, 84, 44, 29, 2092, 2344, 2216, 8, 1123, 228, 76, 56, 279, 6, 376, 3, 345, 1, 435, 1474, 4, 56, 2, 497, 21, 173, 8, 288, 65, 23, 7, 73, 4, 3, 366, 2025, 21, 311, 11302, 7, 5, 2058, 109, 62, 73, 59, 2323, 2, 1242, 187, 564, 216, 230, 36, 3, 52, 166, 126, 654, 10, 49, 27, 60, 236, 734, 10, 513, 4, 887, 1, 7, 3, 67, 111, 774, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 151, 11, 1123, 4, 3, 364, 180, 72, 5, 3, 698, 180, 531, 13, 810, 18, 13, 603, 243, 13, 810, 27, 13, 106, 19, 1999, 2, 584, 83, 810, 18, 18, 603, 511, 13, 810, 27, 13, 106, 19, 3825, 72, 5, 56, 279, 497, 5, 655, 139, 2344, 15, 2092, 2344, 4, 157, 734, 7139, 7, 224, 35, 1874, 5, 602, 166, 126, 802, 378, 3525, 480, 807, 3713, 360, 197, 28, 33, 60, 13, 567, 19, 144, 4, 3, 331, 418, 320, 65, 3116, 9, 24, 497, 603, 77, 497, 89, 3627, 1276, 2, 191, 51, 42, 306, 345, 23, 24, 228, 38, 228, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 2058, 109, 62, 71, 231, 5, 954, 4, 497, 2, 56, 6779, 5, 655, 139, 2344, 2, 2092, 2344, 11, 2017, 2, 2216, 380, 34, 182, 72, 5, 56, 279, 89, 3627, 1276, 2, 191, 24, 51, 11, 306, 177, 3539, 3, 99, 1, 26, 45, 303, 1833, 22, 8, 2252, 2482, 6, 376, 3, 189, 345, 1, 564, 216, 222, 23, 3, 228, 1, 2058, 109, 62]",1858.0,20876426,Clinical outcome children newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated 1995 2005,1,0.001092896174863388
"Adolescent cancer survivors' smoking intentions are associated with aggression, attention, and smoking history.",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2010-10-05,"The present study examines behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with smoking intentions and experimentation among adolescent survivors of pediatric cancer. Adolescent survivors of brain tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n  =  99) provided information about their smoking histories and their intentions to smoke in the future. Behavior rating scales were completed by survivors, parents, and teachers. Past experimentation with smoking and higher levels of self-reported aggression were associated with intentions to smoke in the future (OR  =  4.18, 95% CI 1.02-17.04, and OR  =  1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, respectively), while teacher-ratings of inattention in the classroom were negatively associated with intentions to smoke (OR  =  0.94, 95% CI.88-.99), all p  < .05. Experimentation with smoking was more likely among older survivors (OR  =  1.76, 95% CI 1.16-2.66, p  < .01) and those whose parents had divorced (OR  =  4.40, 95% CI 1.21-16.06, p  < .05). A concerning minority of adolescent survivors have clear intentions to smoke, a behavior that adds to their overall health risk. Smoking intentions and experimentation are important precursors to regular smoking. Prevention efforts are needed to interrupt the progression from intentions and experimentation to established smoking and nicotine dependence in this medically vulnerable population. Assessment of an adolescent's history of parental divorce, past experimentation with smoking, and aggressive behavior will identify those survivors who are likely to consider smoking in the future.

Dose escalation of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemias.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-10-18,"Lenalidomide is effective in myeloma and low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with deletion 5q. We report results of a phase I dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Thirty-one adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and four adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at escalating doses of 25 to 75 mg daily on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to provide pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data. Patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 22 to 79 years) and a median of two prior therapies (range, one to four therapies). The DLT was fatigue; 50 mg/d was the MTD. Infectious complications were frequent. Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally with dose. In AML, five (16%) of 31 patients achieved complete remission (CR); three of three patients with cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR (none with deletion 5q). Response duration ranged from 5.6 to 14 months. All responses occurred in AML with low presenting WBC count. No patient with ALL responded.

As little is known about their dietary or nutrient intake that may affect their long-term bone health, we examined nutrient intake in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. Survivors (n = 164) of childhood ALL who had completed treatment for at least 5 years and were in continuous remission, completed a 110-item food questionnaire that reflected dietary intake over the previous year. The analyzed cohort comprised 34 females and 38 males younger than 19 years and 45 females and 47 males at least 19 years. Reported nutrient intake and food selection were compared with age-specific Recommended Dietary Allowance and USDA Pyramid Food Guide. Body mass index was compared to the general US population, adjusted for age, gender, Tanner stage and race. Less than 30% of participants met recommended dietary intakes for vitamin D, calcium, potassium, or magnesium regardless of age. Mean daily caloric intake was 2,204 kcal (51% from carbohydrates) for younger and 2,160 kcal (49% from carbohydrates) for older participants. Energy intake from sweets was 70% higher than recommended.

Targeting neuropilin-1 in human leukemia and lymphoma.,Blood,Blood,2010-11-09,"Targeted drug delivery offers an opportunity for the development of safer and more effective therapies for the treatment of cancer. In this study, we sought to identify short, cell-internalizing peptide ligands that could serve as directive agents for specific drug delivery in hematologic malignancies. By screening of human leukemia cells with a combinatorial phage display peptide library, we isolated a peptide motif, sequence Phe-Phe/Tyr-Any-Leu-Arg-Ser (F(F)/(Y)XLRS), which bound to different leukemia cell lines and to patient-derived bone marrow samples. The motif was internalized through a receptor-mediated pathway, and we next identified the corresponding receptor as the transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). Moreover, we observed a potent anti-leukemia cell effect when the targeting motif was synthesized in tandem to the pro-apoptotic sequence (D)(KLAKLAK)₂. Finally, our results confirmed increased expression of NRP-1 in representative human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and in a panel of bone marrow specimens obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myelogenous leukemia compared with normal bone marrow. These results indicate that NRP-1 could potentially be used as a target for ligand-directed therapy in human leukemias and lymphomas and that the prototype CGFYWLRSC-GG-(D)(KLAKLAK)₂ is a promising drug candidate in this setting.",Journal Article,3360.0,71.0,Targeted drug delivery offers opportunity development safer effective therapies treatment sought identify short cell-internalizing peptide ligands serve directive agents specific drug delivery hematologic malignancies screening human leukemia combinatorial phage display peptide library isolated peptide motif sequence Phe-Phe/Tyr-Any-Leu-Arg-Ser F F XLRS bound different leukemia lines patient-derived bone marrow motif internalized receptor-mediated pathway identified corresponding receptor transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 NRP-1 observed potent anti-leukemia effect targeting motif synthesized tandem pro-apoptotic sequence KLAKLAK ₂ Finally confirmed increased expression NRP-1 representative human leukemia lymphoma lines panel bone marrow specimens obtained patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia compared normal bone marrow indicate NRP-1 potentially target ligand-directed therapy human leukemias lymphomas prototype CGFYWLRSC-GG- KLAKLAK ₂ promising drug candidate setting,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[238, 234, 989, 2339, 35, 2666, 9, 3, 193, 1, 9276, 2, 80, 323, 235, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12, 4, 26, 45, 21, 990, 6, 255, 978, 31, 15932, 1389, 3123, 17, 359, 1833, 22, 16936, 183, 9, 112, 234, 989, 4, 813, 441, 20, 453, 1, 171, 37, 5, 8, 3866, 8648, 3640, 1389, 4157, 21, 1355, 8, 1389, 5298, 1532, 15139, 15139, 11106, 500, 11539, 7844, 6963, 1068, 1068, 2055, 59521, 92, 2951, 6, 338, 31, 285, 2, 6, 69, 526, 581, 347, 3, 5298, 10, 12149, 298, 8, 153, 517, 308, 2, 21, 1305, 108, 3, 1734, 153, 22, 3, 5527, 4455, 15253, 14, 11164, 14, 1393, 21, 164, 8, 1157, 312, 2647, 31, 254, 198, 3, 529, 5298, 10, 5134, 4, 2905, 6, 3, 1805, 1631, 1532, 427, 46315, 46316, 1368, 114, 99, 557, 101, 55, 1, 11164, 14, 4, 3724, 171, 2, 31, 285, 2, 4, 8, 993, 1, 581, 623, 683, 29, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 15, 286, 2194, 72, 5, 295, 581, 46, 99, 1008, 17, 11164, 14, 359, 751, 40, 95, 22, 8, 283, 9, 1232, 1166, 36, 4, 171, 2792, 2, 1557, 2, 17, 3, 8743, 59522, 4334, 427, 46315, 46316, 16, 8, 721, 234, 1609, 4, 26, 546]",1302.0,21063027,Targeting neuropilin-1 human leukemia lymphoma,189,0.20655737704918034
Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome.,BMC medical genetics,BMC Med. Genet.,2010-11-16,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03).

Modeling mechanisms of in vivo variability in methotrexate accumulation and folate pathway inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,PLoS computational biology,PLoS Comput. Biol.,2010-12-02,"Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The accumulation of MTX and its active metabolites, methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG), in ALL cells is an important determinant of its antileukemic effects. We studied 194 of 356 patients enrolled on St. Jude Total XV protocol for newly diagnosed ALL with the goal of characterizing the intracellular pharmacokinetics of MTXPG in leukemia cells; relating these pharmacokinetics to ALL lineage, ploidy and molecular subtype; and using a folate pathway model to simulate optimal treatment strategies. Serial MTX concentrations were measured in plasma and intracellular MTXPG concentrations were measured in circulating leukemia cells. A pharmacokinetic model was developed which accounted for the plasma disposition of MTX along with the transport and metabolism of MTXPG. In addition, a folate pathway model was adapted to simulate the effects of treatment strategies on the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS). The intracellular MTXPG pharmacokinetic model parameters differed significantly by lineage, ploidy, and molecular subtypes of ALL.

Improved prognosis for older adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-12-20,"The prognosis for older adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been historically much worse than that for younger patients. We reviewed the outcome of older adolescents (age 15 to 18 years) treated in four consecutive Total Therapy studies to determine if recent improved treatment extended to this high-risk group. Between 1991 and 2007, 963 pediatric patients, including 89 older adolescents, were enrolled on Total Therapy studies XIIIA, XIIIB, XIV, and XV. In the first three studies, treatment selection was based on presenting clinical features and leukemic cell genetics. In study XV, the level of residual disease was used to guide treatment, which featured intensive methotrexate, glucocorticoid, vincristine, and asparaginase, as well as early triple intrathecal therapy for higher-risk ALL. The 89 older adolescents were significantly more likely to have T-cell ALL, the t(4;11)(MLL-AF4), and detectable minimal residual disease during or at the end of remission induction; they were less likely to have the t(12;21)(ETV6-RUNX1) compared with younger patients. In the first three studies, the 44 older adolescents had significantly poorer event-free survival and overall survival than the 403 younger patients. This gap in prognosis was abolished in study XV: event-free survival rates at 5 years were 86.4% ± 5.2% (standard error) for the 45 older adolescents and 87.4% ± 1.7% for the 453 younger patients; overall survival rates were 87.9% ± 5.1% versus 94.1% ± 1.2%, respectively.

Association of the highly prevalent TP53 R337H mutation with pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma and osteosarcoma in southeast Brazil.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-12-29,"The inherited, low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 (R337H) of the tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) is clustered in southeast Brazil (estimated frequency, 0.3%). Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P = .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 187), recurrent ALL (n = 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 44), lymphoma (n = 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n = 26), Ewing sarcoma (n = 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 8). Among the tumors that were available for analysis, LOH with retention of the mutant allele was confirmed in 21 of 21 ACTs, in 2 of 2 CPCs, and in 2 of 3 osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H. CPCs and osteosarcomas that were positive for R337H had marked nuclear accumulation of p53. The current findings demonstrated compellingly that the TP53 R337H mutation is associated not only with ACT but also with CPC and, to a lesser extent, with osteosarcoma, both of which are core-component tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",Journal Article,3310.0,45.0,inherited low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution codon 337 R337H 53 TP53 clustered southeast Brazil estimated frequency 0.3 tumorigenic effect initially appeared tissue-specific recent evidence suggests association broader range authors report investigated spectrum pediatric malignancies associated TP53 R337H single referral institution southeast Brazil Genomic DNA 493 children malignancies screened R337H Available carriers investigated loss heterozygosity LOH nuclear p53 accumulation Clinical obtained medical records Sixty-five 70 patients 93 adrenocortical ACTs 9 13 patients 69 choroid plexus carcinoma CPC 3 41 patients 7.3 osteosarcoma carried proportion CPC choroid plexus papilloma CPP higher reported Osteosarcoma carriers significantly poorer outcome P .02 identified patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia n 187 recurrent n 49 acute myeloid leukemia n 44 lymphoma n 30 non-CPC central nervous n 26 Ewing sarcoma n 25 rhabdomyosarcoma n 8 available LOH retention allele confirmed 21 21 ACTs 2 2 CPCs 2 3 osteosarcomas positive R337H CPCs osteosarcomas positive R337H marked nuclear accumulation p53 current findings demonstrated compellingly TP53 R337H associated ACT CPC lesser extent osteosarcoma core-component Li-Fraumeni syndrome,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2986, 154, 4792, 5392, 6, 15954, 5029, 28, 3673, 8275, 29109, 1, 3, 30, 178, 699, 145, 1206, 16, 6464, 4, 21377, 10452, 661, 675, 13, 27, 242, 211, 3795, 254, 1625, 2121, 6, 40, 246, 112, 435, 241, 844, 211, 248, 5, 8, 5410, 184, 1, 57, 673, 3, 738, 1, 26, 414, 565, 3, 1873, 1, 815, 441, 41, 5, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 28, 8, 226, 2096, 731, 4, 21377, 10452, 572, 261, 347, 29, 11304, 541, 5, 441, 11, 2261, 9, 3, 29109, 258, 390, 30, 347, 29, 1316, 11, 565, 9, 407, 1, 3963, 2594, 2, 928, 624, 1835, 38, 74, 11, 683, 29, 484, 1064, 1746, 365, 1, 431, 7, 966, 5, 57, 4459, 83, 1, 233, 7, 790, 5, 12169, 9576, 134, 9305, 2, 27, 1, 605, 7, 67, 27, 5, 2629, 3, 258, 3, 920, 1, 9305, 6, 12169, 9576, 7017, 17117, 10, 1802, 142, 76, 17, 210, 7116, 4, 1316, 42, 8, 97, 1769, 228, 19, 588, 3, 258, 10, 44, 108, 4, 7, 54, 42, 286, 1275, 62, 78, 5568, 387, 62, 78, 739, 286, 533, 78, 584, 78, 201, 220, 9305, 854, 1880, 398, 57, 78, 432, 78, 243, 15, 78, 66, 107, 3, 57, 17, 11, 390, 9, 65, 2594, 5, 3947, 1, 3, 620, 1254, 10, 557, 4, 239, 1, 239, 4459, 4, 18, 1, 18, 12903, 2, 4, 18, 1, 27, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 12903, 2, 11089, 17, 11, 109, 9, 29109, 42, 2003, 928, 1835, 1, 624, 3, 291, 272, 264, 46385, 17, 3, 1206, 29109, 258, 16, 41, 44, 158, 5, 2559, 84, 120, 5, 9305, 2, 6, 8, 5191, 1039, 5, 110, 1, 92, 32, 1793, 1249, 57, 1, 3, 5066, 9130, 681]",1747.0,21192060,Association highly prevalent TP53 R337H pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma osteosarcoma southeast Brazil,1,0.001092896174863388
Use of matched unrelated donors compared with matched related donors is associated with lower relapse and superior progression-free survival after reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-12-27,"As success of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) relies primarily on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, increased minor HLA disparity in unrelated compared to related donors could have a significant impact on transplant outcomes. To assess whether use of unrelated donors (URD) engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors (MRD), we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD (n = 246) and MRD (n = 187) RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Diseases included: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (127), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (71), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (68), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (64), Hodgkin disease (HD) (40), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (25), multiple myeloma (MM) (23), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (12), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7), and other leukemia (1). All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate (mini-MTX) or tacrolimus/sirolimus ± mini-MTX. Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD (median donor age: 33 years versus 52 years, P < .0001), and provided larger CD34(+) products (median CD34(+) cells infused: 8.7 × 10(6)/kg versus 7.5 × 10(6)/kg, P = .002). Distribution of diseases, disease risk, prior transplant, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was similar in both cohorts. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (at day +180), 2-year chronic GVHD, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 20% versus 16%, 55% versus 50%, and 8% versus 6% in URD and MRD, respectively (P = NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD, 52% versus 65% (P = .005). With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants, 39.5% for URD, and 29% for MRD (P = .01). Overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 56% for URD versus 50% for MRD (P = .53). In multivariable analysis, URD was associated with a lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, P = .002) and superior PFS (HR 0.69, P = .002).

Improvements in risk classification are allowing clinicians to identify patients at high risk for relapse early in their course of therapy. Whether patients defined as high risk by new methods will benefit from HSCT requires careful testing. Standardization and improvement of transplant approaches has led to equivalent survival outcomes with matched sibling and well-matched unrelated donors; however, survival using mismatched and haploidentical donors is generally worse.

A review of English literature on childhood acute leukemias from the past 5 years was performed. Contemporary treatments have resulted in 5-year event-free survival rates of approximately 80% for childhood ALL and almost 60% for pediatric AML. The advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses has provided new insights into leukemogenesis and identified many novel subtypes of leukemia. Virtually all ALL and the vast majority of AML cases can be classified according to specific genetic abnormalities. Cooperative mutations involved in cell differentiation, cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, drug responsiveness, and apoptosis have also been identified in many cases. The development of new formulations of existing drugs, molecularly targeted therapy, and immunotherapies promises to further advance the cure rates and improve quality of life of patients.

Pediatric phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of dasatinib: a report from the children's oncology group phase I consortium.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-01-24,"PURPOSE Dasatinib is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar activity against SRC family kinases, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, EPHA2, and the PDGF-β receptor. Dasatinib was found to have selective activity in several tumor models in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. PATIENTS AND METHODS A phase I study of dasatinib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or imatinib-refractory, Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia was performed. Dose levels of 50, 65, 85, and 110 mg/m²/dose, administered orally twice daily for 28 days, with courses repeated without interruption, were studied. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with the initial dose. A total of 39 patients (solid tumors, n = 28; chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], n = 9; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n = 2) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at the 50, 65, and 85 mg/m² dose levels. At 110 mg/m², two of six patients experienced DLT including grade 2 diarrhea and headache. In children with leukemia, grade 4 hypokalemia (50 mg/m²), grade 3 diarrhea (85 mg/m²), and grade 2 creatinine elevation (50 mg/m²) were observed. DLT in later courses included pleural effusions, hemangiomatosis, and GI hemorrhage. There were three complete cytogenetic responses, three partial cytogenetic responses, and two partial/minimal cytogenetic responses observed in evaluable patients with CML.

Hematol.,2011-01-26,"Rationally designed therapies aim at the specific disruption of critical signaling pathways activated by malignant transformation or signals from the tumor microenvironment. Because mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important signal integrator and a key translational regulator, we evaluated its potential involvement in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and whether mTOR blockade synergizes with chemotherapeutic agents or other signaling antagonists to inhibit primary leukemia T cells. mTOR signaling status was assessed using biochemical, immunostaining, and molecular regulation studies and functional assays performed to assess the impact of mTOR blockade on T-ALL proliferation, survival, and cell cycle. We observed that mTOR signaling is highly activated in all T-ALL patients tested, with phosphorylation of its downstream substrates eIF4G and S6 ribosomal protein. mTOR activation was detected in vivo and was further increased in vitro by stimulation with interleukin-7, a potentially leukemogenic cytokine normally produced by the bone marrow microenvironment. In T-ALL cells, mTOR blockade was associated with accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), which preferentially adopted a nuclear localization. Functional studies using rapamycin or CCI-779 showed a dominant inhibitory effect of mTOR blockade on interleukin-7-induced proliferation, survival, and cell-cycle progression of T-ALL cells. Furthermore, mTOR blockade markedly potentiated the antileukemia effects of dexamethasone and doxorubicin, and showed highly synergistic interactions in combination with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Janus kinase 3 signaling. This study shows activation of mTOR signaling in primary T-ALL cells evolving in the leukemic bone marrow, and supports the inclusion of mTOR antagonists in current therapeutic regimens for this cancer.",Journal Article,3282.0,,Rationally designed therapies aim specific disruption critical signaling pathways activated malignant transformation signals microenvironment mammalian target rapamycin mTOR important signal integrator key translational regulator evaluated potential involvement T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL mTOR blockade synergizes chemotherapeutic agents signaling antagonists inhibit primary leukemia mTOR signaling status assessed biochemical immunostaining molecular regulation studies functional performed assess impact mTOR blockade T-ALL proliferation survival cycle observed mTOR signaling highly activated T-ALL patients tested phosphorylation downstream substrates eIF4G S6 ribosomal mTOR activation detected vivo increased vitro stimulation interleukin-7 potentially leukemogenic cytokine normally produced bone marrow microenvironment T-ALL mTOR blockade associated accumulation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 preferentially adopted nuclear localization Functional studies rapamycin CCI-779 showed dominant inhibitory effect mTOR blockade interleukin-7-induced proliferation survival cell-cycle progression T-ALL Furthermore mTOR blockade markedly potentiated antileukemia effects dexamethasone doxorubicin showed highly synergistic interactions combination specific inhibitors phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt Janus kinase 3 signaling shows activation mTOR signaling primary T-ALL evolving leukemic bone marrow supports inclusion mTOR antagonists current therapeutic regimens,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6352, 1114, 235, 1130, 28, 3, 112, 3220, 1, 740, 314, 460, 735, 20, 393, 1392, 15, 2312, 29, 3, 30, 995, 408, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 16, 35, 305, 1235, 46428, 2, 8, 825, 2460, 2452, 21, 194, 211, 174, 799, 4, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 2, 317, 873, 1189, 10824, 5, 1573, 183, 15, 127, 314, 4444, 6, 1433, 86, 102, 37, 873, 314, 156, 10, 275, 75, 1487, 5027, 2, 219, 863, 94, 2, 583, 1013, 173, 6, 423, 3, 345, 1, 873, 1189, 23, 102, 62, 457, 25, 2, 31, 417, 21, 164, 17, 873, 314, 16, 561, 735, 4, 62, 102, 62, 7, 650, 5, 982, 1, 211, 1489, 6063, 23334, 2, 4977, 8194, 178, 873, 363, 10, 530, 4, 386, 2, 10, 195, 101, 4, 439, 20, 2503, 5, 1603, 67, 8, 751, 13519, 1675, 6150, 1687, 20, 3, 581, 995, 4, 102, 62, 37, 873, 1189, 10, 41, 5, 1835, 1, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 230, 2804, 5584, 92, 3509, 4457, 8, 928, 2145, 583, 94, 75, 1620, 15, 4934, 7173, 224, 8, 2156, 1810, 254, 1, 873, 1189, 23, 1603, 67, 277, 457, 25, 2, 31, 417, 91, 1, 102, 62, 37, 798, 873, 1189, 2195, 6707, 3, 9169, 176, 1, 1217, 2, 856, 2, 224, 561, 1806, 1286, 4, 150, 5, 112, 222, 1, 3415, 27, 216, 649, 2, 6191, 216, 27, 314, 26, 45, 1949, 363, 1, 873, 314, 4, 86, 102, 62, 37, 3276, 4, 3, 2015, 581, 2, 2304, 3, 1680, 1, 873, 4444, 4, 291, 189, 472, 9, 26, 12]",1856.0,21277936,Targeting active mTOR inhibits primary leukemia synergizes cytotoxic drugs signaling inhibitors,0,0.0
Symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in long-term survivors of childhood leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-01-28,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) sometimes have clinical features that suggest attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), though few studies have examined specific symptoms in survivors. Long-term survivors of childhood ALL (n = 161) received a neurological examination, while parents completed rating scales to establish formal criteria for ADHD. Symptom profiles were generated and compared across demographic and treatment characteristics, as well as medical tests associated with brain pathology. Prevalence rates of ADHD were similar in survivors (10.5%) compared to those reported in the general population (7-10%). However, 25.5% of survivors reported symptoms that impair functioning in multiple settings, with attention problems being most common. These symptoms were associated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) (mean inattentive symptoms [SD] = 3.6 [3.19] for group treated with CRT vs. 1.6 [2.40] for non-CRT group, P = 0.0006), and survivors who demonstrated impaired anti-saccades during the neurologic exam (mean inattentive symptoms [SD] = 3.4 [3.29] for those with impaired anti-saccades vs. 1.4 [2.41] for those with normal anti-saccades; P = 0.0004).

First-in-man study of CPX-351: a liposomal carrier containing cytarabine and daunorubicin in a fixed 5:1 molar ratio for the treatment of relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-01-31,"This phase I dose-escalation trial was performed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of CPX-351. CPX-351 induction was administered on days 1, 3, and 5 by 90-minute infusion to 48 relapsed or refractory patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplasia. Doses started at 3 units/m(2) with dose doublings in single-patient cohorts until a pharmacodynamic effect (treatment-related adverse events or reduction in bone marrow cellularity or blast count) was observed, followed by 33% escalations in three patient cohorts until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred. The maximum-tolerated dose was 101 units/m(2). DLTs consisted of hypertensive crisis, congestive heart failure, and prolonged cytopenias. Adverse events were consistent with cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. Response occurred at doses as low as 32 units/m(2). Of 43 patients with AML, nine had complete response (CR) and one had CR with incomplete platelet recovery; of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one of three had CR. Eight CRs were achieved among the 31 patients with prior cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. CR in AML occurred in five of 26 patients age ≥ 60 years and in five of 17 patients younger than age 60 years. Median half-life was 31.1 hours (cytarabine) and 21.9 hours (daunorubicin), with both drugs and their metabolites detectable > 7 days after the last dose. The targeted 5:1 molar ratio was maintained at all dose levels for up to 24 hours. The recommended dose of CPX-351 for phase II study is 101 units/m(2).

Ancestry and pharmacogenomics of relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2011-02-06,"Although five-year survival rates for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are now over 80% in most industrialized countries, not all children have benefited equally from this progress. Ethnic differences in survival after childhood ALL have been reported in many clinical studies, with poorer survival observed among African Americans or those with Hispanic ethnicity when compared with European Americans or Asians.

White non-Hispanic race was the only patient variable predictive of NP. One hundred and seventy-four of 498 patients (34.9%) experienced 207 episodes of NP; 16% (28 of 174) patients experienced at least one recurrence of pain after the initial episode. No statistical significance was found in the relation between the severity (grade) of the NP episode and the cumulative dose of vincristine (P = 0.45) or the vincristine dose that immediately preceded the diagnosis (1.5 mg/m(2) versus 2.0 mg/m(2) [correction made here after initial online publication], P = 0.59). Of 180 episodes with treatment data, 62.2% (112) and 37.8% (68) were treated with gabapentin or opioids, respectively.

The prognostic significance of these parameters was assessed in the context of intensive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based chemotherapy. The authors studied 65 adult patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received treatment with TKI-based therapy, correlated their clinicopathologic heterogeneity with patient outcome, and compared the findings with those from 60 adult patients with diploid B-cell ALL who received similar chemotherapy without a TKI. Ph-positive ALL was associated with older age (P = .01), the common-B immunophenotype characterized by a greater frequency of CD13 (alanine aminopeptidase) coexpression (P = .004), CD66c (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3) expression (P = .007), and CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) expression (P < .001) and with a lower frequency of CD15 (3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine) expression (P < .001). Conventional karyotypic analyses indicated that the Ph chromosome was the sole abnormality in 19 patients (30%), was present with other aberrancies in 43 patients (65%), and was absent (detectable only by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] analysis) in 3 patients (5%).

The presence of a supernumerary Ph chromosome was correlated with a higher incidence of CD20 (B-lymphocyte antigen, nonglycosylated phosphoprotein) expression (P < .001), whereas the p210 construct was correlated with aberrant CD25 expression (P = .05). Outcomes were not influenced by the degree of karyotypic complexity (including the presence or absence of a supernumerary Ph chromosome), CD20 expression, or myeloid antigen expression (CD13, CD33 [myeloid lineage transmembrane receptor], CD66c).

We compared the oncolytic potential of MV in two B-cell malignancies; adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, an aggressive leukemia) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, an indolent leukemia overexpressing Bcl-2) using patient-derived material. In vitro, distinct cytopathological effects were observed between MV-infected primary ALL and CLL cells, with large multinucleated syncytia forming in ALL cultures compared to minimal cell-to-cell fusion in infected CLL cells. Cell viability and immunoblotting studies confirmed rapid cell death in MV-infected ALL cultures and slower MV oncolysis of CLL cells. In cell lines, overexpression of Bcl-2 diminished MV-induced cell death providing a possible mechanism for the slower kinetic of MV oncolysis in CLL. In vivo, intratumoral MV treatment of established subcutaneous ALL xenografts had striking antitumor activity leading to complete resolution of all tumors. The antitumor activity of MV was also evident in disseminated ALL xenograft models. In summary, both ALL and CLL are targets for MV-mediated lysis albeit with different kinetics. The marked sensitivity of both primary ALL cells and ALL xenografts to MV oncolysis highlights the tremendous potential of MV as a novel replicating-virus therapy for adult ALL.",Journal Article,3227.0,,Clinical trials vaccine measles virus MV anticancer therapy underway compared oncolytic potential MV B-cell malignancies adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia aggressive leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL indolent leukemia overexpressing Bcl-2 patient-derived material vitro distinct cytopathological effects observed MV-infected primary CLL large multinucleated syncytia forming cultures compared minimal cell-to-cell fusion infected CLL viability immunoblotting studies confirmed rapid death MV-infected cultures slower MV oncolysis CLL lines overexpression Bcl-2 diminished MV-induced death providing possible mechanism slower kinetic MV oncolysis CLL vivo intratumoral MV treatment established subcutaneous xenografts striking antitumor activity leading complete resolution antitumor activity MV evident disseminated xenograft models summary CLL targets MV-mediated lysis albeit different kinetics marked sensitivity primary xenografts MV oncolysis highlights tremendous potential MV novel replicating-virus therapy adult,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[38, 143, 75, 1274, 7424, 1450, 3491, 22, 1475, 36, 32, 3298, 3948, 21, 72, 3, 3236, 174, 1, 3491, 4, 100, 132, 31, 441, 780, 286, 1275, 62, 35, 571, 2, 442, 1193, 552, 35, 2316, 2810, 1044, 18, 75, 69, 526, 3692, 4, 439, 834, 43365, 176, 11, 164, 59, 3491, 3369, 86, 62, 2, 552, 37, 5, 375, 15649, 22231, 4525, 4, 62, 3231, 72, 6, 1048, 31, 6, 31, 1212, 4, 3369, 552, 37, 31, 2120, 2, 5293, 94, 557, 1321, 31, 273, 4, 3491, 3369, 62, 3231, 2, 6715, 3491, 9739, 1, 552, 37, 4, 31, 285, 851, 1, 1044, 18, 2849, 3491, 277, 31, 273, 1736, 8, 899, 670, 9, 3, 6715, 7009, 1, 3491, 9739, 4, 552, 4, 386, 2074, 3491, 24, 1, 635, 2529, 62, 1348, 42, 5133, 579, 128, 1049, 6, 236, 2125, 1, 62, 57, 3, 579, 128, 1, 3491, 10, 120, 2853, 4, 3605, 62, 1330, 274, 4, 1962, 110, 62, 2, 552, 32, 637, 9, 3491, 517, 4783, 5993, 5, 338, 3839, 3, 2003, 485, 1, 110, 86, 62, 37, 2, 62, 1348, 6, 3491, 9739, 2527, 3, 6678, 174, 1, 3491, 22, 8, 229, 13012, 1450, 36, 9, 780, 62]",1307.0,21427708,Differential cytopathology kinetics measles oncolysis primary B-cell malignancies provides mechanistic insights,1,0.001092896174863388
Shortening infusion time for high-dose methotrexate alters antileukemic effects: a randomized prospective clinical trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-03-28,"To determine whether shortening the infusion duration of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX; 1 g/m(2)) affects the in vivo accumulation of active methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG(1-7)) in leukemia cells and whether this differs among major acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subtypes. From June 2000 through October 2007, 356 children with ALL were randomly assigned to receive initial single-agent treatment with HDMTX (1 g/m(2)) as either a 24-hour infusion or a 4-hour infusion at two pediatric hospitals in the United States. The primary outcome measures were the accumulation of MTXPG(1-7) in leukemia cells and the antileukemic effects (eg, inhibition of de novo purine synthesis in bone marrow ALL cells, and decrease in circulating ALL cells). The 24-hour infusion resulted in significantly higher amounts of MTXPG(1-7) in bone marrow leukemia cells (median: 1,695 v 1,150 pmol/10(9) cells, P = .0059), and better antileukemic effects. The 24-hour infusion had the greatest effect on MTXPG(1-7) accumulation in hyperdiploid ALL (median: 3,919 v 2,417 pmol/10(9) cells, P = .0038); T-cell ALL exhibited smaller differences in MTXPG(1-7) but greater antileukemic effects with the longer infusion (median decrease in leukemia cells: 88.4% v 51.8%, P = .0075). In contrast, infusion duration had no significant impact on MTXPG(1-7) accumulation or antileukemic effects in ALL with the t(12;21)/(ETV6-RUNX1) chromosomal translocation.

Recent studies in adolescents and young adults reported better outcomes when therapy was intensified. Based on hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone) as a backbone, we designed an augmented version with intensified doses of vincristine, dexamethasone, and asparaginase (L-asparaginase in the first 62 patients and pegaspargase in the remainder) starting from course 1. Ninety patients have been enrolled, with a median age of 34 years (range, 14-70 years). Most patients (78%) had pre-B ALL and were in first salvage (76%), with a first remission duration of 12.6 months (range, 1-78 months). Ten patients had primary refractory disease.

Phosphorylated CXCR4 is associated with poor survival in adults with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-03-31,"CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is activated by phosphorylation (pCXCR4) and is essential for the migration of hematopoietic precursors to bone marrow. CXCR4 overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Data regarding the prognostic impact of CXCR4 in patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are sparse and limited to the pediatric population. The authors analyzed CXCR4 and pCXCR4 expression in 54 adults with newly diagnosed B-ALL. CXCR4 was assessed by flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an anti-CXCR4 antibody. pCXCR4 expression was assessed using an anti-pCXCR4 antibody. The study group included 30 men and 24 women with a median age of 42 years (range, 17-84 years). Philadelphia chromosome was present in 19 patients. The median follow-up was 16 months (range, 17-84 months). Forty-nine patients had a complete response, and 12 patients relapsed with a median relapse free survival >120 weeks. Fifteen patients (28%) died with a median survival >125 weeks. CXCR4 detected by FC and IHC was highly correlated (P < .001). CXCR4 was not associated with clinical or laboratory findings or survival. In contrast, pCXCR4 was associated with higher leukocyte count (P = .006) and serum bilirubin level (P = .03). In multivariate analysis, pCXCR4 expression (P = .027), high serum creatinine level (P < .01), presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (P = .017), and late clinical response (P < .001) were associated with worse overall survival.

Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: current treatment and future perspectives.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Ph-positive ALL carried a dismal prognosis and was characterized by a poor response to most chemotherapy combinations, short remission durations, and poor survival rates. Outcomes for patients with Ph-positive ALL improved substantially with the introduction of TKIs, and the TKI imatinib induced complete remissions in >95% of patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL when it was combined with chemotherapy. However, imatinib resistance remains a problem in a substantial proportion of patients with Ph-positive ALL, and multiple molecular mechanisms that contribute to imatinib resistance have been identified.

HDAC inhibitors potentiate the activity of the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor KW-2449 in imatinib-sensitive or -resistant BCR/ABL+ leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-04-07,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACI) such as vorinostat or entinostat (SNDX-275) could increase the lethality of the dual Bcr/Abl-Aurora kinase inhibitor KW-2449 in various Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells, including those resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM). Bcr/Abl(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, including those resistant to IM (T315I, E255K), were exposed to KW-2449 in the presence or absence of vorinostat or SNDX-275, after which apoptosis and effects on signaling pathways were examined. In vivo studies combining HDACIs and KW2449 were carried out by using a systemic IM-resistant ALL xenograft model. Coadministration of HDACIs synergistically increased KW-2449 lethality in vitro in multiple CML and Ph(+) ALL cell types including human IM resistant cells (e.g., BV-173/E255K and Adult/T315I). Combined treatment resulted in inactivation of Bcr/Abl and downstream targets (e.g., STAT5 and CRKL), as well as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA damage (γH2A.X). The latter events and cell death were significantly attenuated by free radical scavengers (TBAP). Increased lethality was also observed in primary CD34(+) cells from patients with CML, but not in normal CD34(+) cells. Finally, minimally active vorinostat or SNDX275 doses markedly increased KW2449 antitumor effects and significantly prolonged the survival of murine xenografts bearing IM-resistant ALL cells (BV173/E255K). HDACIs increase KW-2449 lethality in Bcr/Abl(+) cells in association with inhibition of Bcr/Abl, generation of ROS, and induction of DNA damage. This strategy preferentially targets primary Bcr/Abl(+) hematopoietic cells and exhibits enhanced in vivo activity.

New markers for minimal residual disease detection in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-04-12,"To identify new markers for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we compared genome-wide gene expression of lymphoblasts from 270 patients with newly diagnosed childhood ALL to that of normal CD19⁺CD10⁺ B-cell progenitors (n = 4). Expression of 30 genes differentially expressed by ≥ 3-fold in at least 25% of cases of ALL (or 40% of ALL subtypes) was tested by flow cytometry in 200 B-lineage ALL and 61 nonleukemic BM samples, including samples containing hematogones. Of the 30 markers, 22 (CD44, BCL2, HSPB1, CD73, CD24, CD123, CD72, CD86, CD200, CD79b, CD164, CD304, CD97, CD102, CD99, CD300a, CD130, PBX1, CTNNA1, ITGB7, CD69, CD49f) were differentially expressed in up to 81.4% of ALL cases; expression of some markers was associated with the presence of genetic abnormalities. Results of MRD detection by flow cytometry with these markers correlated well with those of molecular testing (52 follow-up samples from 18 patients); sequential studies during treatment and diagnosis-relapse comparisons documented their stability. When incorporated in 6-marker combinations, the new markers afforded the detection of 1 leukemic cell among 10(5) BM cells.

Resistance to the translation initiation inhibitor silvestrol is mediated by ABCB1/P-glycoprotein overexpression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,The AAPS journal,AAPS J,2011-05-04,"Protein synthesis is a powerful therapeutic target in leukemias and other cancers, but few pharmacologically viable agents are available that affect this process directly. The plant-derived agent silvestrol specifically inhibits translation initiation by interfering with eIF4A/mRNA assembly with eIF4F. Silvestrol has potent in vitro and in vivo activity in multiple cancer models including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is under pre-clinical development by the US National Cancer Institute, but no information is available about potential mechanisms of resistance. In a separate report, we showed that intraperitoneal silvestrol is approximately 100% bioavailable systemically, although oral doses were only 1% bioavailable despite an apparent lack of metabolism. To explore mechanisms of silvestrol resistance and the possible role of efflux transporters in silvestrol disposition, we characterized multi-drug resistance transporter expression and function in a silvestrol-resistant ALL cell line generated via culture of the 697 ALL cell line in gradually increasing silvestrol concentrations. This resistant cell line, 697-R, shows significant upregulation of ABCB1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) as well as cross-resistance to known Pgp substrates vincristine and romidepsin.

We evaluated acute neurobehavioral side effects of corticosteroid therapy in preschool versus school-age children by obtaining structured reports weekly for 1 month. Parents of 62 children (2-17 years) treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 participated during the continuation phase of treatment. Patients received cyclical twice-daily 5-day courses of prednisone (PRED; 40 mg/m(2) /day) or dexamethasone (DEX; 6 mg/m(2) /day). Parents completed behavior rating scales about their child weekly during one steroid cycle [baseline (Day 0), active steroid (Day 7), post-steroid (Days 14 and 21)]. Behavioral side effects increased significantly (P < 0.001) during the steroid week for preschool children (<6 years) on measures of emotional control, mood, behavior regulation, and executive functions, returning to baseline during the two ""off-steroid"" weeks. In contrast, school-age children (≥ 6 years) did not demonstrate an increase in side effects during the steroid week. Steroid type (PRED vs. DEX) was not a significant predictor of neurobehavioral side effects. Preschool children are at greater risk for neurobehavioral side effects during active steroid treatment for ALL than school-age children and adolescents. DEX was not associated with more neurobehavioral side effects than PRED. Counseling of families about side-effects should be adapted according to age.

Managing Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2011-04-08,"Before the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the prognosis for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was poor. The treatment of choice, stem cell transplantation, is a potentially curative option, but it is available only for a minority of patients and is associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Although imatinib is largely effective, a substantial proportion of patients become resistant or intolerant to it. The activity of imatinib may be enhanced by coadministration with chemotherapy; such treatment is effective in many patients. Dasatinib is established as a second-line treatment in patients with resistance to or intolerance of imatinib. Recent data suggest that dasatinib, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, has utility as first-line therapy. Dasatinib is more potent than imatinib, is less susceptible to drug-resistance mechanisms, and has been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it potentially effective for treating central nervous system disease. Patients who relapse during treatment with dasatinib frequently carry the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL. Future regimens combining dasatinib with an agent able to inhibit this mutation may further improve outcome.",Journal Article,3210.0,14.0,introduction tyrosine kinase inhibitors prognosis patients Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia poor treatment choice stem transplantation potentially curative option available minority patients associated significant risk morbidity mortality imatinib largely effective substantial proportion patients resistant intolerant activity imatinib enhanced coadministration chemotherapy treatment effective patients Dasatinib established second-line treatment patients resistance intolerance imatinib Recent suggest dasatinib combination chemotherapy utility first-line therapy Dasatinib potent imatinib susceptible drug-resistance mechanisms shown penetrate blood-brain barrier making potentially effective treating central nervous disease Patients relapse treatment dasatinib frequently carry T315I BCR-ABL Future regimens combining dasatinib agent able inhibit improve outcome,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[348, 3, 2456, 1, 564, 216, 222, 3, 356, 9, 7, 5, 3006, 1170, 109, 286, 1275, 10, 334, 3, 24, 1, 1866, 452, 31, 497, 16, 8, 751, 1075, 1501, 84, 192, 16, 390, 158, 9, 8, 2652, 1, 7, 2, 16, 41, 5, 93, 43, 1, 787, 2, 282, 242, 577, 16, 1733, 323, 8, 1281, 920, 1, 7, 1417, 436, 15, 4944, 6, 192, 3, 128, 1, 577, 68, 40, 651, 20, 5777, 5, 56, 225, 24, 16, 323, 4, 445, 7, 1674, 16, 635, 22, 8, 419, 328, 24, 4, 7, 5, 251, 6, 15, 5266, 1, 577, 435, 74, 309, 17, 1674, 361, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 56, 71, 1207, 22, 157, 328, 36, 1674, 16, 80, 1157, 76, 577, 16, 299, 4012, 6, 234, 251, 483, 2, 71, 85, 443, 6, 14514, 3, 315, 342, 3318, 1079, 192, 751, 323, 9, 1367, 854, 1880, 398, 34, 7, 54, 429, 190, 24, 5, 1674, 746, 3542, 3, 6184, 258, 1, 1062, 1425, 508, 472, 1525, 1674, 5, 35, 420, 1665, 6, 1433, 26, 258, 68, 195, 401, 228]",1243.0,21575924,Managing Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia role tyrosine kinase inhibitors,351,0.3836065573770492

Improvement in the recent cohorts was observed regardless of donor type (sibling, 70% vs 24%; unrelated, 61% vs 37%; and haploidentical, 88% vs 19%), attributable to less infection (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.12; P = .005), regimen-related toxicity (HR = 0.25; P = .002), and leukemia-related death (HR = 0.40; P = .01). Survival probability was dependent on leukemia status (first remission vs more advanced disease; HR = 0.63; P = .03) or minimal residual disease (positive vs negative; HR = 2.10; P = .01) at the time of transplantation.

Cohort data from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study. Department of Cancer Control at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Subjects were adults enrolled in St Jude Lifetime Cohort study and treated for childhood ALL between 1962 and 1999. As part of a comprehensive evaluation, participants had dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and muscle strength testing. The participants consisted of 261 women and 232 men who were 20.4 to 49.8 years old (median, 35.7y), and 12.7 to 46.5 years from diagnosis of childhood ALL (median, 27.2y). Not applicable.

Role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the management of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2011-09-01,"The Philadelphia chromosome is the most common cytogenetic abnormality found in adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The result of this abnormality is the BCR-ABL protein, a constitutively active kinase involved in cell signaling and survival. When managed with multiagent chemotherapy regimens alone, patients have traditionally had an inferior outcome in terms of remission duration and overall survival when compared with patients who are Philadelphia chromosome-negative. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and dasatinib, directly inhibit the BCR-ABL kinase, offering a targeted approach as a therapeutic option. As a result of several clinical trials with adequate follow-up, imatinib combined with chemotherapy represents the current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has previously been the only modality to offer the potential for a cure, and it still should be considered for all patients deemed able to tolerate such an intervention. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib, may further improve the outcome in these patients. The role of molecular monitoring and the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors after stem cell transplantation are areas of active investigation, and the results of ongoing trials will help to clarify the optimal management of these patients.",Journal Article,3064.0,14.0,Philadelphia chromosome common cytogenetic abnormality adult patients diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia abnormality BCR-ABL constitutively active kinase involved signaling survival managed multiagent chemotherapy regimens patients traditionally inferior outcome terms remission duration overall survival compared patients Philadelphia chromosome-negative Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib dasatinib directly inhibit BCR-ABL kinase offering targeted approach therapeutic option clinical trials adequate follow-up imatinib combined chemotherapy represents current standard care patients newly diagnosed disease Allogeneic stem transplantation previously modality offer potential cure considered patients deemed able tolerate intervention Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib improve outcome patients role molecular monitoring use tyrosine kinase inhibitors stem transplantation areas active investigation ongoing trials help clarify optimal management patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3006, 1170, 16, 3, 96, 186, 1266, 3698, 204, 4, 780, 7, 265, 5, 286, 1275, 3, 757, 1, 26, 3698, 16, 3, 1062, 1425, 178, 8, 2818, 544, 216, 646, 4, 31, 314, 2, 25, 198, 2231, 5, 7148, 56, 472, 279, 7, 47, 4206, 42, 35, 1663, 228, 4, 1794, 1, 734, 654, 2, 63, 25, 198, 72, 5, 7, 54, 32, 3006, 1170, 199, 302, 1354, 564, 216, 222, 225, 22, 577, 2, 1674, 1606, 1433, 3, 1062, 1425, 216, 5846, 8, 238, 353, 22, 8, 189, 1501, 22, 8, 757, 1, 392, 38, 143, 5, 1658, 166, 126, 577, 397, 5, 56, 1449, 3, 291, 260, 1, 165, 9, 7, 5, 732, 265, 34, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 71, 373, 85, 3, 158, 1396, 6, 1918, 3, 174, 9, 8, 1722, 2, 192, 1234, 257, 40, 515, 9, 62, 7, 3779, 1665, 6, 5010, 225, 35, 788, 419, 914, 564, 216, 222, 225, 22, 1674, 68, 195, 401, 3, 228, 4, 46, 7, 3, 200, 1, 219, 1315, 2, 3, 119, 1, 564, 216, 222, 50, 452, 31, 497, 32, 1361, 1, 544, 940, 2, 3, 99, 1, 942, 143, 303, 987, 6, 3968, 3, 665, 284, 1, 46, 7]",1382.0,21660654,Role tyrosine kinase inhibitors management Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia,12,0.013114754098360656

Key pathways are frequently mutated in high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Blood,Blood,2011-06-16,"We sequenced 120 candidate genes in 187 high-risk childhood B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias, the largest pediatric cancer genome sequencing effort reported to date. Integrated analysis of 179 validated somatic sequence mutations with genome-wide copy number alterations and gene expression profiles revealed a high frequency of recurrent somatic alterations in key signaling pathways, including B-cell development/differentiation (68% of cases), the TP53/RB tumor suppressor pathway (54%), Ras signaling (50%), and Janus kinases (11%). Recurrent mutations were also found in ETV6 (6 cases), TBL1XR1 (3), CREBBP (3), MUC4 (2), ASMTL (2), and ADARB2 (2). The frequency of mutations within the 4 major pathways varied markedly across genetic subtypes. Among 23 leukemias expressing a BCR-ABL1-like gene expression profile, 96% had somatic alterations in B-cell development/differentiation, 57% in JAK, and 52% in both pathways, whereas only 9% had Ras pathway mutations. In contrast, 21 cases defined by a distinct gene expression profile coupled with focal ERG deletion rarely had B-cell development/differentiation or JAK kinase alterations but had a high frequency (62%) of Ras signaling pathway mutations.

Neuropsychological outcomes of standard risk and high risk patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on Dana-Farber ALL consortium protocol 95-01 at 5 years post-diagnosis.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-06-30,"Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as High Risk (HR) patients may be more vulnerable to neurocognitive late effects because of the greater intensity of their therapy. We compared neuropsychological outcomes in children treated for Standard Risk (SR) or HR ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Consortium ALL Protocol 95-01. We also evaluated their performance relative to normative expectations. Between 1996 and 2000, 498 children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated on Protocol 95-01, 298 of whom were eligible for neuropsychological follow-up. A feature of this protocol was modification of risk group criteria to treat more children as SR rather than HR patients, intended to minimize toxicities. Testing was completed at a median of 5.3 years post-diagnosis for 211 patients (70.8%; ages 6-25 years; 45.5% male; 40% HR), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. Test scores for both groups were generally at or above normative expectation, with the exception of verbal working memory, processing complex visual information, and parent ratings of metacognitive skills.

"Epoetin alpha decreases the number of erythrocyte transfusions in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma: results of a randomized clinical trial.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-07-12,"Anemia is an expected consequence of intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to patients with acute leukemia. This study was designed to determine whether epoetin alpha would decrease the number of transfusion events and units of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) transfused, and the secondary objective was to study the effects of epoetin alpha on quality of life (QOL) and complete remission (CR) rates. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who were receiving frontline myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive epoetin alpha or no epoetin during the first 6 cycles of their planned chemotherapy. QOL was assessed by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia questionnaires. Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive epoetin alpha, and 54 patients received no epoetin. Transfusion data were available for 79 of 81 evaluable patients (98%) who completed the treatment/observation period. The trial was stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met. A mean of 10.6 units of PRBCs over 5 months were administered to those who received epoetin alpha compared with 13 units for those who did not receive epoetin (P = .04). There was no significant difference in QOL as assessed by the FACT-Anemia or ESAS instruments. The CR rate and the 3-year CR duration were not affected adversely by use of epoetin alpha. Epoetin alpha decreased the number of PRBC transfusions and did not appear to have a negative impact on remission duration.

Neuromuscular impairments in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: associations with physical performance and chemotherapy doses.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-07-15,"Treatment regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) contain neurotoxic agents that may interfere with neuromuscular health. In this study, the authors examined associations between neuromuscular impairments and physical function and between neuromuscular impairments and doses of vincristine and intrathecal methotrexate used to treat leukemia among survivors of childhood ALL. ALL survivors >10 years from diagnosis participated in neuromuscular performance testing. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. Regression models were used to evaluate associations between treatment factors, neuromuscular impairments, and physical performance. Among 415 survivors (median age, 35 years; age range, 21-52 years), balance, mobility, and 6-minute walk (6MW) distances were 1.3 standard deviations below age-specific and sex-specific values in 15.4%, 3.6%, and 46.5% of participants, respectively. Impairments included absent Achilles tendon reflexes (39.5%), active dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) <5 degrees (33.5%), and impaired knee extension strength (30.1%). In adjusted models (including cranial radiation), survivors who received cumulative intrathecal methotrexate doses ≥215 mg/m(2) were 3.4 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.8 times more likely) to have impaired ROM than survivors who received no intrathecal methotrexate, and survivors who received cumulative vincristine doses ≥39 mg/m(2) were 1.5 times more likely (95% CI, 1.0-2.5 times more likely) to have impaired ROM than survivors who received lower cumulative doses of vincristine. Higher intrathecal methotrexate doses were associated with reduced knee extension strength and 6MW distances. Neuromuscular impairments were prevalent in childhood ALL survivors and interfered with physical performance. Higher cumulative doses of vincristine and/or intrathecal methotrexate were associated with long-term neuromuscular impairments, which have implications on future function as these survivors age.",Journal Article,3112.0,72.0,Treatment regimens childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia contain neurotoxic agents interfere neuromuscular health authors examined associations neuromuscular impairments physical function neuromuscular impairments doses vincristine intrathecal methotrexate treat leukemia survivors childhood survivors 10 years diagnosis participated neuromuscular performance testing Treatment abstracted medical records Regression models evaluate associations treatment factors neuromuscular impairments physical performance 415 survivors median age 35 years age range 21-52 years balance mobility 6-minute walk 6MW distances 1.3 standard deviations age-specific sex-specific values 15.4 3.6 46.5 participants respectively Impairments included absent Achilles tendon reflexes 39.5 active dorsiflexion range motion ROM 5 degrees 33.5 impaired knee extension strength 30.1 adjusted models including cranial radiation survivors received cumulative intrathecal methotrexate doses ≥215 mg/m 2 3.4 times likely 95 confidence interval 1.2-9.8 times likely impaired ROM survivors received intrathecal methotrexate survivors received cumulative vincristine doses ≥39 mg/m 2 1.5 times likely 95 CI 1.0-2.5 times likely impaired ROM survivors received lower cumulative doses vincristine Higher intrathecal methotrexate doses associated reduced knee extension strength 6MW distances Neuromuscular impairments prevalent childhood survivors interfered physical performance Higher cumulative doses vincristine and/or intrathecal methotrexate associated long-term neuromuscular impairments implications future function survivors age,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 472, 9, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 3725, 11148, 183, 17, 68, 6178, 5, 14209, 341, 4, 26, 45, 3, 738, 409, 685, 59, 14209, 6948, 2, 900, 343, 2, 59, 14209, 6948, 2, 415, 1, 2132, 2, 5126, 2116, 95, 6, 943, 107, 332, 1, 864, 62, 62, 332, 79, 60, 29, 147, 3025, 4, 14209, 528, 471, 24, 74, 11, 4106, 29, 484, 1064, 320, 274, 11, 95, 6, 376, 685, 59, 24, 130, 14209, 6948, 2, 900, 528, 107, 10069, 332, 52, 89, 465, 60, 89, 184, 239, 653, 60, 3459, 5717, 2, 49, 3949, 8200, 21543, 11022, 11, 14, 27, 260, 7810, 2736, 89, 112, 2, 1035, 112, 1030, 4, 167, 39, 27, 49, 2, 641, 33, 1, 776, 106, 6948, 159, 3269, 21442, 23606, 46679, 587, 33, 544, 35156, 184, 1, 2967, 17113, 33, 4133, 466, 33, 2, 2364, 12013, 2401, 3671, 201, 14, 4, 586, 274, 141, 2565, 121, 332, 54, 103, 967, 5126, 2116, 415, 60363, 81, 188, 18, 11, 27, 39, 1072, 80, 322, 48, 307, 268, 14, 18, 83, 66, 1072, 80, 322, 6, 47, 2364, 17113, 76, 332, 54, 103, 77, 5126, 2116, 2, 332, 54, 103, 967, 2132, 415, 27080, 81, 188, 18, 11, 14, 33, 1072, 80, 322, 48, 58, 14, 13, 18, 33, 1072, 80, 322, 6, 47, 2364, 17113, 76, 332, 54, 103, 280, 967, 415, 1, 2132, 142, 5126, 2116, 415, 11, 41, 5, 405, 12013, 2401, 3671, 2, 21543, 11022, 14209, 6948, 11, 2485, 4, 864, 62, 332, 2, 13569, 5, 900, 528, 142, 967, 415, 1, 2132, 2, 15, 5126, 2116, 11, 41, 5, 319, 337, 14209, 6948, 92, 47, 1268, 23, 508, 343, 22, 46, 332, 89]",1930.0,21766297,Neuromuscular impairments adult survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia associations physical performance chemotherapy doses,0,0.0

Treatment recommendations unchanged or strengthened by new evidence include: (1) allogeneic SCT is recommended over chemotherapy for ALL in second complete remission or greater; (2) allogeneic is superior to autologous SCT; and (3) there are similar survival outcomes after related and unrelated allogeneic SCT. New treatment recommendations based on new evidence include: (1) in the absence of a suitable allogeneic donor, autologous SCT may be an appropriate therapy, but results in a high relapse rate; (2) it is appropriate to consider cord blood transplantation for patients with no HLA well-matched donor; and (3) imatinib therapy before and/or after SCT (for Ph+ ALL) yields significantly superior survival outcomes.

Characterization of the CDR3 structure of the Vβ21 T cell clone in patients with P210(BCR-ABL)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Human immunology,Hum. Immunol.,2011-07-20,"The clonally expanded T cells identified in most cancer patients that respond to tumor-associated antigen such as P210(BCR-ABL) protein have definite, specific antitumor cytotoxicity. T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ CDR3 repertoire diversity was analyzed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and BCR-ABL(+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) by GeneScan. A high frequency of oligoclonal expansion of the TCR Vβ21 subfamily was observed in the peripheral blood of CML and B-ALL patients. These clonally expanded Vβ21 T cells were correlated with the pathophysiologic process of CML. A conserved amino acid motif (SLxxV) was observed within the CDR3 region in only 3 patients with CML. Preferential usage of the Jβ segments was also observed in a minority of patients.

Safety and persistence of adoptively transferred autologous CD19-targeted T cells in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy refractory B-cell leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2011-08-17,"We report the findings from the first 10 patients with chemotherapy-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) we have enrolled for treatment with autologous T cells modified to express 19-28z, a second-generation chimeric antigen (Ag) receptor specific to the B-cell lineage Ag CD19. Eight of the 9 treated patients tolerated 19-28z(+) T-cell infusions well. Three of 4 evaluable patients with bulky CLL who received prior conditioning with cyclophosphamide exhibited either a significant reduction or a mixed response in lymphadenopathy without concomitant development of B-cell aplasia. In contrast, one patient with relapsed ALL who was treated in remission with a similar T-cell dose developed a predicted B-cell aplasia. The short-term persistence of infused T cells was enhanced by prior cyclophosphamide administration and inversely proportional to the peripheral blood tumor burden. Further analyses showed rapid trafficking of modified T cells to tumor and retained ex vivo cytotoxic potential of CD19-targeted T cells retrieved 8 days after infusion. We conclude that this adoptive T-cell approach is promising and more likely to show clinical benefit in the setting of prior conditioning chemotherapy and low tumor burden or minimal residual disease.

Pronounced hypoxia in models of murine and human leukemia: high efficacy of hypoxia-activated prodrug PR-104.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-08-11,"Recent studies indicate that interactions between leukemia cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment promote leukemia cell survival and confer resistance to anti-leukemic drugs. There is evidence that BM microenvironment contains hypoxic areas that confer survival advantage to hematopoietic cells. In the present study we investigated whether hypoxia in leukemic BM contributes to the protective role of the BM microenvironment. We observed a marked expansion of hypoxic BM areas in immunodeficient mice engrafted with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Consistent with this finding, we found that hypoxia promotes chemoresistance in various ALL derived cell lines. These findings suggest to employ hypoxia-activated prodrugs to eliminate leukemia cells within hypoxic niches. Using several xenograft models, we demonstrated that administration of the hypoxia-activated dinitrobenzamide mustard, PR-104 prolonged survival and decreased leukemia burden of immune-deficient mice injected with primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

Non-lineage/stage-restricted effects of a gain-of-function mutation in tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells.,The Journal of experimental medicine,J. Exp. Med.,2011-09-19,"Activating mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase 11 (Ptpn11) have been identified in childhood acute leukemias, in addition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), which is a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). It is not clear whether activating mutations of this phosphatase play a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias. If so, the cell origin of leukemia-initiating stem cells (LSCs) remains to be determined. Ptpn11(E76K) mutation is the most common and most active Ptpn11 mutation found in JMML and acute leukemias. However, the pathogenic effects of this mutation have not been well characterized. We have created Ptpn11(E76K) conditional knock-in mice. Global Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation results in early embryonic lethality. Induced knock-in of this mutation in pan hematopoietic cells leads to MPD as a result of aberrant activation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors. These animals subsequently progress to acute leukemias. Intriguingly, in addition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and B-ALL are evolved. Moreover, tissue-specific knock-in of Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation in lineage-committed myeloid, T lymphoid, and B lymphoid progenitors also results in AML, T-ALL, and B-ALL, respectively. Further analyses have revealed that Shp2 (encoded by Ptpn11) is distributed to centrosomes and that Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation promotes LSC development, partly by causing centrosome amplification and genomic instability. Thus, Ptpn11(E76K) mutation has non-lineage-specific effects on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells and initiates acute leukemias at various stages of hematopoiesis.",Journal Article,3046.0,65.0,Activating tyrosine phosphatase 11 Ptpn11 identified childhood acute leukemias addition juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML myeloproliferative disorder MPD clear activating phosphatase play causal role pathogenesis acute leukemias origin leukemia-initiating stem LSCs remains determined Ptpn11 E76K common active Ptpn11 JMML acute leukemias pathogenic effects characterized created Ptpn11 E76K conditional knock-in mice Global Ptpn11 E76K/+ early embryonic lethality Induced knock-in pan hematopoietic leads MPD aberrant activation hematopoietic stem HSCs myeloid progenitors animals subsequently progress acute leukemias Intriguingly addition acute myeloid leukemia AML acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma T-ALL B-ALL evolved tissue-specific knock-in Ptpn11 E76K/+ lineage-committed myeloid lymphoid B lymphoid progenitors AML T-ALL B-ALL respectively revealed Shp2 encoded Ptpn11 distributed centrosomes Ptpn11 E76K/+ promotes LSC development partly causing centrosome amplification genomic instability Ptpn11 E76K non-lineage-specific effects malignant transformation hematopoietic initiates acute leukemias stages hematopoiesis,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1616, 138, 4, 178, 564, 2577, 175, 8403, 47, 85, 108, 4, 864, 286, 2792, 4, 352, 6, 7857, 5451, 16768, 92, 16, 8, 2645, 7712, 192, 16, 44, 885, 317, 1616, 138, 1, 26, 2577, 1343, 8, 5163, 200, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 286, 2792, 492, 1743, 3, 31, 1938, 1, 2647, 2637, 452, 37, 7033, 469, 6, 40, 509, 8403, 29202, 258, 16, 3, 96, 186, 2, 96, 544, 8403, 258, 204, 4, 16768, 2, 286, 2792, 137, 3, 2806, 176, 1, 26, 258, 47, 44, 85, 149, 765, 21, 47, 2466, 8403, 29202, 3212, 6252, 4, 399, 1648, 8403, 29202, 258, 99, 4, 191, 5390, 3266, 277, 6252, 4, 1, 26, 258, 4, 3055, 1007, 37, 1940, 6, 7712, 22, 8, 757, 1, 1898, 363, 1, 1007, 452, 37, 6185, 2, 533, 4321, 46, 2258, 1611, 1466, 6, 286, 2792, 11550, 4, 352, 6, 286, 533, 329, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 2647, 4763, 102, 62, 2, 132, 62, 32, 3937, 1393, 246, 112, 6252, 4, 1, 8403, 29202, 258, 4, 2542, 9552, 533, 102, 2303, 2, 132, 2303, 4321, 120, 99, 4, 329, 102, 62, 2, 132, 62, 106, 195, 318, 47, 553, 17, 15508, 4587, 20, 8403, 16, 4737, 6, 23761, 2, 17, 8403, 29202, 258, 2148, 6643, 193, 5180, 20, 3440, 7432, 1073, 2, 572, 1753, 631, 8403, 29202, 258, 71, 220, 2542, 112, 176, 23, 393, 1392, 1, 1007, 37, 2, 11935, 286, 2792, 28, 747, 1153, 1, 5114]",1601.0,21930766,Non-lineage/stage-restricted effects gain-of-function tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 Shp2 malignant transformation hematopoietic,3,0.003278688524590164
Somatic deletions of genes regulating MSH2 protein stability cause DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance in human leukemia cells.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2011-09-25,"DNA mismatch repair enzymes (for example, MSH2) maintain genomic integrity, and their deficiency predisposes to several human cancers and to drug resistance. We found that leukemia cells from a substantial proportion of children (∼11%) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia have low or undetectable MSH2 protein levels, despite abundant wild-type MSH2 mRNA. Leukemia cells with low levels of MSH2 contained partial or complete somatic deletions of one to four genes that regulate MSH2 degradation (FRAP1 (also known as MTOR), HERC1, PRKCZ and PIK3C2B); we also found these deletions in individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16%) and sporadic colorectal cancer (13.5%). Knockdown of these genes in human leukemia cells recapitulated the MSH2 protein deficiency by enhancing MSH2 degradation, leading to substantial reduction in DNA mismatch repair and increased resistance to thiopurines. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby somatic deletions of genes regulating MSH2 degradation result in undetectable levels of MSH2 protein in leukemia cells, DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance.",Journal Article,3040.0,68.0,DNA mismatch repair enzymes example MSH2 maintain genomic integrity deficiency predisposes human drug resistance leukemia substantial proportion children ∼11 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia low undetectable MSH2 levels despite abundant wild-type MSH2 mRNA Leukemia low levels MSH2 contained partial complete somatic deletions regulate MSH2 degradation FRAP1 known MTOR HERC1 PRKCZ PIK3C2B deletions individuals adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia 16 sporadic colorectal 13.5 Knockdown human leukemia recapitulated MSH2 deficiency enhancing MSH2 degradation leading substantial reduction DNA mismatch repair increased resistance thiopurines findings reveal previously unrecognized mechanism somatic deletions regulating MSH2 degradation undetectable levels MSH2 leukemia DNA mismatch repair deficiency drug resistance,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[261, 2617, 972, 3039, 9, 2685, 4272, 3040, 572, 4797, 2, 136, 2299, 10563, 6, 392, 171, 163, 2, 6, 234, 251, 21, 204, 17, 37, 29, 8, 1281, 920, 1, 541, 26972, 5, 732, 265, 286, 1275, 47, 154, 15, 3920, 4272, 178, 148, 550, 4834, 955, 267, 4272, 956, 37, 5, 154, 148, 1, 4272, 3070, 450, 15, 236, 1119, 2439, 1, 104, 6, 294, 214, 17, 2288, 4272, 2373, 23161, 120, 440, 22, 873, 60587, 60588, 2, 46791, 21, 120, 204, 46, 2439, 4, 869, 5, 780, 286, 1275, 245, 2, 1928, 12, 233, 33, 1563, 1, 46, 214, 4, 171, 37, 8064, 3, 4272, 178, 2299, 20, 2430, 4272, 2373, 1049, 6, 1281, 628, 4, 261, 2617, 972, 2, 101, 251, 6, 39767, 46, 272, 2396, 8, 373, 6055, 670, 6131, 1119, 2439, 1, 214, 2681, 4272, 2373, 757, 4, 3920, 148, 1, 4272, 178, 4, 37, 261, 2617, 972, 2299, 2, 234, 251]",1059.0,21946537,Somatic deletions regulating MSH2 stability cause DNA mismatch repair deficiency drug resistance human leukemia,0,0.0

The primary endpoint was overall response rate (complete remission [CR] plus CR without platelet recovery [CRp]). Among the 25 patients (median age, 14 years; pre-B cell ALL, 84%; ≥ 2 prior regimens: 84%; refractory to previous regimen: 60%), the overall response rate was 44% (7 CR, 4 CRp) with a 67.3-week median duration or remission censored at last follow-up.

ATF5 polymorphisms influence ATF function and response to treatment in children with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-10-04,"Asparaginase is a standard and critical component in the therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and the basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) and arginosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) have been shown to mediate the antileukemic effect of asparaginase and to display variable expression between leukemia cells that are resistant and sensitive to treatment. Fourteen polymorphisms in the regulatory and coding regions of these genes were investigated for an association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia outcome. Lower event-free survival (EFS) was associated with ATF5 T1562C, tandem-repeat ASNS polymorphism, derived haplotype, and ASS1 G1343T and G34T substitutions (P ≤ .03). Associations were limited to patients who received Escherichia coli asparaginase. Variations that sustained correction for multiple testing (ATF5 T1562C, P = .005; ASNS tandem-repeat and related haplotype, P ≤ .01) were subsequently analyzed in the replication cohort. The E coli-dependent association of the ATF5 T1562 allele with reduced EFS was confirmed (P = .01). A gene-reporter assay showed that the haplotype tagged by T1562 had higher promoter activity (P ≤ .01). The remaining regulatory polymorphisms also appeared to affect ATF5 function; 2 additional high-activity haplotypes were identified (P ≤ .02) and were further corroborated by quantitative mRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Family history of cancer and non-malignant diseases and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Children's Oncology Group Study.,Cancer epidemiology,Cancer Epidemiol,2011-10-21,"Studies of family history of cancer and non-malignant diseases in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) show inconsistent findings. Most studies show no increased risk with family history of cancer. Non-malignant diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects and thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with ALL. We conducted a case-control study of family history of cancer and selected non-malignant conditions (allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects, and thyroid diseases). ALL cases were obtained from Children's Cancer Group institutions from January 1989 to June 1993. Controls were recruited via random digit dialing. Family history for first degree relatives and grandparents of ALL cases and controls was collected by structured telephone questionnaires. Conditional logistical regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusting for potential confounders. We found a borderline association of ALL and having a family member with a history of cancer in cases (n=1842) compared to controls (n=1986) (OR=0.98, 95%CI=0.93, 1.00) and an inverse association for esophageal cancer based on small numbers. Family history of food and drug allergies demonstrated a modestly reduced risk (OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.73, 0.95) as did family history of rheumatoid arthritis (OR=0.79, 95%CI=0.65, 0.96).

Here we show that clinical response to these drugs correlates with, and may be partially governed by, the pretreatment proximity of tumor cell mitochondria to the apoptotic threshold, a property called mitochondrial priming. We used BH3 profiling to measure priming in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia, and ovarian cancer. This assay measures mitochondrial response to peptides derived from proapoptotic BH3 domains of proteins critical for death signaling to mitochondria.

Dexamethasone exposure and asparaginase antibodies affect relapse risk in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2011-11-23,"We have previously hypothesized that higher systemic exposure to asparaginase may cause increased exposure to dexamethasone, both critical chemotherapeutic agents for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Whether interpatient pharmaco-kinetic differences in dexamethasone contribute to relapse risk has never been studied. The impact of plasma clearance of dexamethasone and anti-asparaginase antibody levels on risk of relapse was assessed in 410 children who were treated on a front-line clinical trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and were evaluable for all pharmacologic measures, using multivariate analyses, adjusting for standard clinical and biologic prognostic factors. Dexamethasone clearance (mean ± SD) was higher (P = 3 × 10(-8)) in patients whose sera was positive (17.7 ± 18.6 L/h per m(2)) versus nega-tive (10.6 ± 5.99 L/h per m(2)) for anti-asparaginase antibodies. In multivariate analyses, higher dexamethasone clearance was associated with a higher risk of any relapse (P = .01) and of central nervous system relapse (P = .014). Central nervous system relapse was also more common in patients with anti-asparaginase antibodies (P = .019).

Rare versus common variants in pharmacogenetics: SLCO1B1 variation and methotrexate disposition.,Genome research,Genome Res.,2011-12-06,"Methotrexate is used to treat autoimmune diseases and malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Inter-individual variation in clearance of methotrexate results in heterogeneous systemic exposure, clinical efficacy, and toxicity. In a genome-wide association study of children with ALL, we identified SLCO1B1 as harboring multiple common polymorphisms associated with methotrexate clearance. The extent of influence of rare versus common variants on pharmacogenomic phenotypes remains largely unexplored. We tested the hypothesis that rare variants in SLCO1B1 could affect methotrexate clearance and compared the influence of common versus rare variants in addition to clinical covariates on clearance. From deep resequencing of SLCO1B1 exons in 699 children, we identified 93 SNPs, 15 of which were non-synonymous (NS). Three of these NS SNPs were common, with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%, one had low frequency (MAF 1%-5%), and 11 were rare (MAF <1%). NS SNPs (common or rare) predicted to be functionally damaging were more likely to be found among patients with the lowest methotrexate clearance than patients with high clearance. We verified lower function in vitro of four SLCO1B1 haplotypes that were associated with reduced methotrexate clearance. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis adjusting for other genetic and non-genetic covariates, SLCO1B1 variants accounted for 10.7% of the population variability in clearance. Of that variability, common NS variants accounted for the majority, but rare damaging NS variants constituted 17.8% of SLCO1B1's effects (1.9% of total variation) and had larger effect sizes than common NS variants.

Research efforts conducted through large survivor cohorts, such as the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, are providing new and important insights into the very long-term consequences of ALL therapy, while providing direction for screening recommendations and intervention-based approaches for reducing late morbidity and mortality.",Journal Article,3307.0,40.0,Survival rates children acute lymphoblastic leukemia increased dramatically past 4 decades 5-year survival rates 90 recent trials increasing number children adolescents cured identifying characterizing occurrence long-term adverse late effects increasingly important young population successful treatment associated increased risk adverse outcomes late mortality second neoplasms chronic health conditions endocrine dysfunction psychological function Research efforts conducted large survivor cohorts Childhood Survivor providing new important insights long-term consequences therapy providing direction screening recommendations intervention-based approaches reducing late morbidity mortality,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[25, 151, 9, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 47, 101, 2729, 252, 3, 1219, 39, 1968, 5, 33, 111, 25, 151, 1, 424, 4, 435, 143, 5, 3, 602, 207, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 3733, 1, 62, 1386, 2, 5723, 3, 2291, 1, 319, 337, 290, 807, 176, 71, 1417, 1635, 305, 4, 26, 1169, 266, 1401, 24, 1, 62, 16, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 290, 123, 225, 22, 807, 282, 419, 1179, 442, 341, 1298, 1293, 1527, 2, 2624, 343, 389, 1413, 426, 298, 375, 2628, 736, 225, 22, 3, 864, 12, 2628, 45, 32, 1736, 217, 2, 305, 1957, 237, 3, 923, 319, 337, 3255, 1, 62, 36, 369, 1736, 4651, 9, 453, 883, 2, 788, 90, 611, 9, 1818, 807, 787, 2, 282]",889.0,22160040,Late effects acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy patients diagnosed 0-20 years age,379,0.41420765027322404
Precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurring in patients with a history of prior malignancies: is it therapy-related?,Haematologica,Haematologica,2011-12-29,"Precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurring in patients with a history of malignancies is uncommon, and this condition is not well understood. A retrospective review of 457 adults with precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our hospital identified 44 (9.6%) patients with prior malignancies. The clinical and genetic characteristics of this group of patients was compared with those of their counterparts with de novo disease and the relationship with prior chemoradiation therapy was assessed. Thirty of 44(6.2%) patients received cytotoxic therapies, whereas 14 patients did not. The former group showed a significantly shorter interval from prior malignancy to onset of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36 versus 144 months; P = 0.002). Compared with 413 de novo cases, the frequencies of t(4;11)(q21;q23) (P<0.001) and hypodiploidy (P = 0.009) with loss of chromosome 5, 7 or 17 were significantly higher in patients who received topoisomerase II inhibitor and/or alkylating agents. By contrast, Philadelphia-positive and normal karyotype were more frequent in patients who either did not receive chemotherapy or received only local radiation or nucleoside analogs. Patients with precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia following prior malignancies and chemoradiation were older, had a lower complete remission rate and showed an inferior survival in univariate, but not multivariate analysis. The data support the interpretation that therapy-related precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia does occur. In particular, cases associated with t(4;11)(q21;q23) or hypodiploidy with -5, -7, -17 are likely to be therapy-related and have a poor prognosis.

Role of cytotoxic therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: update of the 2005 evidence-based review.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol.

Treatment recommendations are provided by an expert panel. Allogeneic SCT is recommended for children who: are in second complete remission (CR2) after experiencing an early marrow relapse for precursor-B ALL; experienced primary induction failure, but subsequently achieved a CR1; have T-lineage ALL in CR2; or have ALL in third or greater remission. Although the 2005 pediatric ALL evidence-based review (EBR) recommended allogeneic SCT for children with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL in CR1, preliminary tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) data demonstrate that early outcomes are comparable for allogeneic SCT and chemotherapy + imatinib. Based on the evidence, autologous SCT is not recommended for ALL in CR1. Allogeneic SCT is not recommended for: T-lineage ALL in CR1; mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)+ ALL when it is the sole adverse risk factor; isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse in precursor-B ALL. Based on expert opinion, allogeneic SCT may be considered for hypodiploid ALL and persistent minimal residual disease [corrected] (MRD) positivity in ALL in CR1 or greater, although these are areas that need further study.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2012-03-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease, for which treatment guidelines are still evolving. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic modality for ALL, and this review describes the recent studies and current practice patterns concerning the who, when, and how of allo-HCT in the management of ALL. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ALL after first relapse and is also recommended for high-risk patients in first complete remission (CR1). Minimal residual disease evaluation and monitoring is developing as an important prognostic factor and could guide physicians in determining which patients, especially those with standard risk, might require transplant. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy allows a much higher proportion of Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL patients to attain remission and proceed to transplant with improved results; posttransplant TKI maintenance therapy may also provide survival benefit. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are a reasonable alternative for patients who would otherwise be ineligible for transplant because of age or comorbidity.

Genetic resistance to JAK2 enzymatic inhibitors is overcome by HSP90 inhibition.,The Journal of experimental medicine,J. Exp. Med.,2012-01-23,"Enzymatic inhibitors of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) are in clinical development for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with rearrangements of the cytokine receptor subunit cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2), and other tumors with constitutive JAK2 signaling. In this study, we identify G935R, Y931C, and E864K mutations within the JAK2 kinase domain that confer resistance across a panel of JAK inhibitors, whether present in cis with JAK2 V617F (observed in MPNs) or JAK2 R683G (observed in B-ALL). G935R, Y931C, and E864K do not reduce the sensitivity of JAK2-dependent cells to inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which promote the degradation of both wild-type and mutant JAK2. HSP90 inhibitors were 100-1,000-fold more potent against CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL cells, which correlated with JAK2 degradation and more extensive blockade of JAK2/STAT5, MAP kinase, and AKT signaling. In addition, the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 prolonged survival of mice xenografted with primary human CRLF2-rearranged B-ALL further than an enzymatic JAK2 inhibitor.

Are the psychological needs of adolescent survivors of pediatric cancer adequately identified and treated?,Psycho-oncology,Psychooncology,2012-01-25,"To describe the psychological needs of adolescent survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT), we examined the following: (i) the occurrence of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional concerns identified during a comprehensive psychological evaluation and (ii) the frequency of referrals for psychological follow-up services to address identified concerns. Psychological concerns were identified on measures according to predetermined criteria for 100 adolescent survivors. Referrals for psychological follow-up services were made for concerns previously unidentified in formal assessment or not adequately addressed by current services. Most survivors (82%) exhibited at least one concern across domains: behavioral (76%), cognitive (47%), and emotional (19%). Behavioral concerns emerged most often on scales associated with executive dysfunction, inattention, learning, and peer difficulties. Cranial radiation therapy was associated with cognitive concerns, χ(2) (1, N = 100) = 5.63, p < 0.05. Lower income was associated with more cognitive concerns for ALL survivors, t(47) = 3.28, p < 0.01, and more behavioral concerns for BT survivors, t(48) = 2.93, p < 0.01. Of the survivors with concerns, 38% were referred for psychological follow-up services. Lower-income ALL survivors received more referrals for follow-up, χ(2) (1, N = 41) = 8.05, p < 0.01. Referred survivors had more concerns across domains than non-referred survivors, ALL: t(39) = 2.96, p < 0.01; BT: t(39) = 3.52, p < 0.01. Trends suggest ALL survivors may be at risk for experiencing unaddressed cognitive needs. Many adolescent survivors of cancer experience psychological difficulties that are not adequately managed by current services, underscoring the need for long-term surveillance. In addition to prescribing regular psychological evaluations, clinicians should closely monitor whether current support services appropriately meet survivors' needs, particularly for lower-income survivors and those treated with cranial radiation therapy.",Journal Article,2918.0,30.0,psychological needs adolescent survivors acute lymphoblastic leukemia brain BT examined following occurrence cognitive behavioral emotional concerns identified comprehensive psychological evaluation ii frequency referrals psychological follow-up services address identified concerns Psychological concerns identified measures according predetermined criteria 100 adolescent survivors Referrals psychological follow-up services concerns previously unidentified formal assessment adequately addressed current services survivors 82 exhibited concern domains behavioral 76 cognitive 47 emotional 19 Behavioral concerns emerged scales associated executive dysfunction inattention learning peer difficulties Cranial radiation therapy associated cognitive concerns χ 2 1 N 100 5.63 p 0.05 Lower income associated cognitive concerns survivors 47 3.28 p 0.01 behavioral concerns BT survivors 48 2.93 p 0.01 survivors concerns 38 referred psychological follow-up services Lower-income survivors received referrals follow-up χ 2 1 N 41 8.05 p 0.01 Referred survivors concerns domains non-referred survivors 39 2.96 p 0.01 BT 39 3.52 p 0.01 Trends suggest survivors risk experiencing unaddressed cognitive needs adolescent survivors experience psychological difficulties adequately managed current services underscoring need long-term surveillance addition prescribing regular psychological evaluations clinicians closely monitor current support services appropriately meet survivors needs particularly lower-income survivors treated cranial radiation therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 897, 3, 2624, 1891, 1, 3678, 332, 1, 286, 1275, 62, 15, 342, 30, 3641, 21, 409, 3, 366, 70, 3, 2291, 1, 1863, 4166, 2, 2671, 2061, 108, 190, 8, 949, 2624, 451, 2, 215, 3, 675, 1, 6902, 9, 2624, 166, 126, 2142, 6, 1539, 108, 2061, 2624, 2061, 11, 108, 23, 1018, 768, 6, 10848, 371, 9, 394, 3678, 332, 6902, 9, 2624, 166, 126, 2142, 11, 1229, 9, 2061, 373, 10039, 4, 5057, 455, 15, 44, 4215, 2814, 20, 291, 2142, 96, 332, 878, 1416, 28, 506, 104, 2893, 716, 2703, 4166, 846, 1863, 662, 2, 2671, 326, 4166, 2061, 2054, 96, 629, 23, 5083, 41, 5, 6481, 1527, 23873, 3434, 2, 5084, 4679, 2565, 121, 36, 10, 41, 5, 1863, 2061, 5112, 18, 14, 78, 394, 33, 676, 19, 13, 474, 280, 2306, 10, 41, 5, 80, 1863, 2061, 9, 62, 332, 102, 662, 27, 339, 19, 13, 355, 2, 80, 4166, 2061, 9, 3641, 332, 102, 576, 18, 966, 19, 13, 355, 1, 3, 332, 5, 2061, 519, 11, 1995, 9, 2624, 166, 126, 2142, 280, 2306, 62, 332, 103, 80, 6902, 9, 166, 126, 5112, 18, 14, 78, 605, 66, 474, 19, 13, 355, 1995, 332, 42, 80, 2061, 716, 2703, 76, 220, 1995, 332, 62, 102, 587, 18, 921, 19, 13, 355, 3641, 102, 587, 27, 653, 19, 13, 355, 1963, 309, 62, 332, 68, 40, 28, 43, 9, 2985, 29248, 1863, 1891, 445, 3678, 332, 1, 12, 730, 2624, 4679, 17, 32, 44, 4215, 2231, 20, 291, 2142, 8369, 3, 594, 9, 319, 337, 617, 4, 352, 6, 6840, 3316, 2624, 3816, 1490, 257, 3210, 3334, 317, 291, 538, 2142, 4544, 3362, 332, 1891, 823, 9, 280, 2306, 332, 2, 135, 73, 5, 2565, 121, 36]",1926.0,22278930,psychological needs adolescent survivors pediatric adequately identified treated,0,0.0

Clin. Oncol.,2012-01-30,"Recent genome-wide screens have identified genetic variations in ARID5B associated with susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We sought to determine the contribution of ARID5B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to racial disparities in ALL susceptibility and treatment outcome. We compared the association between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL susceptibility in whites (> 95% European genetic ancestry; 978 cases and 1,046 controls) versus in Hispanics (> 10% Native American ancestry; 330 cases and 541 controls). We determined the relationships between ARID5B SNP genotype and ALL relapse risk in 1,605 children treated on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9904/9905 clinical trials. Among 49 ARID5B SNPs interrogated, 10 were significantly associated with ALL susceptibility in both whites and Hispanics (P < .05), with risk alleles consistently more frequent in Hispanics than in whites. rs10821936 exhibited the most significant association in both races (P = 8.4 × 10(-20) in whites; P = 1 × 10(-6) in Hispanics), and genotype at this SNP was highly correlated with local Native American genetic ancestry (P = 1.8 × 10(-8)). Multivariate analyses in Hispanics identified an additional SNP associated with ALL susceptibility independent of rs10821936. Eight ARID5B SNPs were associated with both ALL susceptibility and relapse hazard; the alleles related to higher ALL incidence were always linked to poorer treatment outcome and were more frequent in Hispanics.

Children with high-risk ALL were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin alone (n = 100; 75 analyzed) or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane (n = 105; 81 analyzed). Echocardiograms and serial serum measurements of cardiac troponin T (cTnT; cardiac injury biomarker), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; cardiomyopathy biomarker), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; inflammatory biomarker) were obtained before, during, and after treatment. cTnT levels were increased in 12% of children in the doxorubicin group and in 13% of the doxorubicin-dexrazoxane group before treatment but in 47% and 13%, respectively, after treatment (P = .005).

The percentage of children with increased hsCRP levels did not differ between groups at any time. In the first 90 days of treatment, detectable increases in cTnT were associated with abnormally reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness 4 years later (P < .01); increases in NT-proBNP were related to an abnormal LV thickness-to-dimension ratio, suggesting LV remodeling, 4 years later (P = .01).

Pharmacokinetic modeling of an induction regimen for in vivo combined testing of novel drugs against pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-03-29,"Current regimens for induction therapy of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or for re-induction post relapse, use a combination of vincristine (VCR), a glucocorticoid, and L-asparaginase (ASP) with or without an anthracycline. With cure rates now approximately 80%, robust pre-clinical models are necessary to prioritize active new drugs for clinical trials in relapsed/refractory patients, and the ability of these models to predict synergy/antagonism with established therapy is an essential attribute. In this study, we report optimization of an induction-type regimen by combining VCR, dexamethasone (DEX) and ASP (VXL) against ALL xenograft models established from patient biopsies in immune-deficient mice. We demonstrate that the VXL combination was synergistic in vitro against leukemia cell lines as well as in vivo against ALL xenografts. In vivo, VXL treatment caused delays in progression of individual xenografts ranging from 22 to >146 days. The median progression delay of xenografts derived from long-term surviving patients was 2-fold greater than that of xenografts derived from patients who died of their disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that systemic DEX exposure in mice increased 2-fold when administered in combination with VCR and ASP, consistent with clinical findings, which may contribute to the observed synergy between the 3 drugs. Finally, as proof-of-principle we tested the in vivo efficacy of combining VXL with either the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, ABT-737, or arsenic trioxide to provide evidence of a robust in vivo platform to prioritize new drugs for clinical trials in children with relapsed/refractory ALL.",Journal Article,2854.0,31.0,Current regimens induction therapy pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia re-induction post relapse use combination vincristine VCR glucocorticoid L-asparaginase ASP anthracycline cure rates approximately 80 robust pre-clinical models necessary prioritize active new drugs clinical trials relapsed/refractory patients ability models predict synergy/antagonism established therapy essential attribute report optimization induction-type regimen combining VCR dexamethasone DEX ASP VXL xenograft models established patient biopsies immune-deficient mice demonstrate VXL combination synergistic vitro leukemia lines vivo xenografts vivo VXL treatment caused delays progression individual xenografts ranging 22 146 days median progression delay xenografts derived long-term surviving patients 2-fold greater xenografts derived patients died disease Pharmacokinetic revealed systemic DEX exposure mice increased 2-fold administered combination VCR ASP consistent clinical findings contribute observed synergy 3 drugs Finally proof-of-principle tested vivo efficacy combining VXL Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor ABT-737 arsenic trioxide provide evidence robust vivo platform prioritize new drugs clinical trials children relapsed/refractory,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[291, 472, 9, 504, 36, 1, 815, 286, 1275, 62, 15, 9, 1491, 504, 539, 429, 119, 8, 150, 1, 2132, 8886, 8, 5399, 2, 805, 3709, 8501, 5, 15, 187, 35, 2044, 5, 1722, 151, 1134, 705, 493, 1922, 671, 38, 274, 32, 1493, 6, 7716, 544, 217, 600, 9, 38, 143, 4, 591, 430, 7, 2, 3, 801, 1, 46, 274, 6, 678, 3439, 7537, 5, 635, 36, 16, 35, 1452, 13530, 4, 26, 45, 21, 414, 3980, 1, 35, 504, 267, 477, 20, 1525, 8886, 1217, 4844, 2, 8501, 35339, 480, 62, 1330, 274, 635, 29, 69, 1154, 4, 250, 1971, 399, 21, 608, 17, 3, 35339, 150, 10, 1806, 4, 439, 480, 31, 285, 22, 149, 22, 4, 386, 480, 62, 1348, 4, 386, 35339, 24, 1546, 3257, 4, 91, 1, 797, 1348, 2223, 29, 350, 6, 4909, 162, 3, 52, 91, 1984, 1, 1348, 526, 29, 319, 337, 3050, 7, 10, 18, 1116, 378, 76, 17, 1, 1348, 526, 29, 7, 54, 1016, 1, 136, 34, 1456, 65, 553, 17, 403, 4844, 645, 4, 399, 101, 18, 1116, 198, 468, 4, 150, 5, 8886, 2, 8501, 925, 5, 38, 272, 92, 68, 1248, 6, 3, 164, 3439, 59, 3, 27, 600, 1368, 22, 3840, 1, 4968, 21, 650, 3, 4, 386, 209, 1, 1525, 35339, 5, 361, 3, 1044, 18, 1044, 3870, 1044, 5444, 230, 3095, 4933, 15, 3217, 4574, 6, 377, 241, 1, 8, 1922, 4, 386, 2243, 6, 7716, 217, 600, 9, 38, 143, 4, 541, 5, 591, 430, 62]",1619.0,22479469,Pharmacokinetic modeling induction regimen vivo combined testing novel drugs pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts,124,0.1355191256830601
Outcomes after induction failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2012-04-01,"Failure of remission-induction therapy is a rare but highly adverse event in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified induction failure, defined by the persistence of leukemic blasts in blood, bone marrow, or any extramedullary site after 4 to 6 weeks of remission-induction therapy, in 1041 of 44,017 patients (2.4%) 0 to 18 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated by a total of 14 cooperative study groups between 1985 and 2000. We analyzed the relationships among disease characteristics, treatments administered, and outcomes in these patients. Patients with induction failure frequently presented with high-risk features, including older age, high leukocyte count, leukemia with a T-cell phenotype, the Philadelphia chromosome, and 11q23 rearrangement. With a median follow-up period of 8.3 years (range, 1.5 to 22.1), the 10-year survival rate (±SE) was estimated at only 32±1%. An age of 10 years or older, T-cell leukemia, the presence of an 11q23 rearrangement, and 25% or more blasts in the bone marrow at the end of induction therapy were associated with a particularly poor outcome. High hyperdiploidy (a modal chromosome number >50) and an age of 1 to 5 years were associated with a favorable outcome in patients with precursor B-cell leukemia. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation from matched, related donors was associated with improved outcomes in T-cell leukemia. Children younger than 6 years of age with precursor B-cell leukemia and no adverse genetic features had a 10-year survival rate of 72±5% when treated with chemotherapy only. Pediatric ALL with induction failure is highly heterogeneous. Patients who have T-cell leukemia appear to have a better outcome with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation than with chemotherapy, whereas patients who have precursor B-cell leukemia without other adverse features appear to have a better outcome with chemotherapy.

Detectable minimal residual disease before hematopoietic cell transplantation is prognostic but does not preclude cure for children with very-high-risk leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-04-19,"In patients with acute leukemia, detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) correlates with risk of relapse. However, the level of MRD that is most likely to preclude cure by HCT is unclear, and the benefit of further chemotherapy to reduce MRD before HCT is unknown. In 122 children with very-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 64) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 58), higher MRD levels at the time of HCT predicted a poorer survival after HCT (P = .0019); MRD was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (P = .0035). However, the increase in risk of death associated with a similar increment of MRD was greater in ALL than in AML, suggesting that a pretransplantation reduction of leukemia burden would have a higher impact in ALL. At any given MRD level, survival rates were higher for patients treated in recent protocols: the 5-year overall survival for patients with ALL was 49% if MRD was detectable and 88% if it was not and the corresponding rates for patients with AML were 67% and 80%, respectively.

There are now more potent BCR-ABL TKIs approved, which allow for additional options when determining front-line and second-line CML and Ph + ALL treatments.

"Treatment outcomes in black and white children with cancer: results from the SEER database and St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 1992 through 2007.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-04-30,"Treatment outcome for black patients with cancer has been significantly worse than for their white counterparts. We determined whether recent improved treatment had narrowed the gap in outcome between black and white pediatric patients. In a parallel comparison, we analyzed survival by disease category between black and white patients with childhood cancer registered in one of the 17 cancer registries of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program or treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, which provides comprehensive treatment to all patients regardless of their ability to pay, from 1992 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2007. Analysis of the SEER data indicated that in both study periods, black patients had significantly poorer rates of survival than did white patients, with the exception of a few types of cancer. Despite significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients who were treated from 2001 to 2007, the racial difference in survival has actually widened for acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. By contrast, in the cohorts treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, there were no significant differences in survival between black and white patients in either study period, regardless of the cancer type. Importantly, the outcome of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and retinoblastoma has improved in parallel for both races during the most recent study period.

Dose escalation of total marrow irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with advanced acute leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-05-15,"We have demonstrated that toxicities are acceptable with total marrow irradiation (TMI) at 16 Gy without chemotherapy or TMI at 12 Gy and the reduced intensity regimen of fludarabine/melphalan in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This article reports results of a study of TMI combined with higher intensity chemotherapy regimens in 2 phase I trials in patients with advanced acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML/ALL) who would do poorly on standard intent-to-cure HCT regimens. Trial 1 consisted of TMI on Days -10 to -6, etoposide (VP16) on Day -5 (60 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (CY) on Day -3 (100 mg/kg). TMI dose was 12 (n=3 patients), 13.5 (n=3 patients), and 15 (n=6 patients) Gy at 1.5 Gy twice daily. Trial 2 consisted of busulfan (BU) on Days -12 to -8 (800 μM min), TMI on Days -8 to -4, and VP16 on Day -3 (30 mg/kg). TMI dose was 12 (n=18) and 13.5 (n=2) Gy at 1.5 Gy twice daily. Trial 1 had 12 patients with a median age of 33 years. Six patients had induction failures (IF), and 6 had first relapses (1RL), 9 with leukemia blast involvement of bone marrow ranging from 10%-98%, 5 with circulating blasts (24%-85%), and 2 with chloromas. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Eleven patients achieved complete remission at Day 30. With a median follow-up of 14.75 months, 5 patients remained in complete remission from 13.5-37.7 months. Trial 2 had 20 patients with a median age of 41 years. Thirteen patients had IF, and 5 had 1RL, 2 in second relapse, 19 with marrow blasts (3%-100%) and 13 with peripheral blasts (6%-63%). Grade 4 dose-limiting toxicities were seen at 13.5 Gy (stomatitis and hepatotoxicity). Stomatitis was the most frequent toxicity in both trials. TMI dose escalation to 15 Gy is possible when combined with CY/VP16 and is associated with acceptable toxicities and encouraging outcomes. TMI dose escalation is not possible with BU/VP16 due to dose-limiting toxicities. Future efforts will focus on whether further dose escalation with CY/VP16 is safe, with the goal of improving disease control in this high-risk population.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2807.0,31.0,demonstrated toxicities acceptable total marrow irradiation TMI 16 Gy chemotherapy TMI 12 Gy reduced intensity regimen fludarabine/melphalan patients undergoing hematopoietic transplantation HCT article reports TMI combined higher intensity chemotherapy regimens 2 phase trials patients advanced acute myelogenous leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia AML/ALL poorly standard intent-to-cure HCT regimens Trial 1 consisted TMI Days -10 -6 etoposide VP16 Day -5 60 mg/kg cyclophosphamide CY Day -3 100 mg/kg TMI dose 12 n=3 patients 13.5 n=3 patients 15 n=6 patients Gy 1.5 Gy twice daily Trial 2 consisted busulfan BU Days -12 -8 800 μM min TMI Days -8 -4 VP16 Day -3 30 mg/kg TMI dose 12 n=18 13.5 n=2 Gy 1.5 Gy twice daily Trial 1 12 patients median age 33 years patients induction failures 6 relapses 1RL 9 leukemia blast involvement bone marrow ranging 10 -98 5 circulating blasts 24 -85 2 chloromas dose-limiting toxicities observed patients achieved complete remission Day 30 median follow-up 14.75 months 5 patients remained complete remission 13.5-37.7 months Trial 2 20 patients median age 41 years Thirteen patients 5 1RL 2 second relapse 19 marrow blasts 3 -100 13 peripheral blasts 6 -63 Grade 4 dose-limiting toxicities seen 13.5 Gy stomatitis hepatotoxicity Stomatitis frequent toxicity trials TMI dose escalation 15 Gy possible combined CY/VP16 associated acceptable toxicities encouraging outcomes TMI dose escalation possible BU/VP16 dose-limiting toxicities Future efforts focus dose escalation CY/VP16 safe goal improving disease control high-risk population,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 47, 264, 17, 385, 32, 1595, 5, 181, 581, 1104, 11845, 28, 245, 381, 187, 56, 15, 11845, 28, 133, 381, 2, 3, 405, 837, 477, 1, 2027, 2370, 4, 7, 479, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 26, 946, 1198, 99, 1, 8, 45, 1, 11845, 397, 5, 142, 837, 56, 472, 4, 18, 124, 70, 143, 4, 7, 5, 131, 286, 2194, 15, 286, 1275, 329, 62, 54, 688, 1022, 1240, 23, 260, 1697, 6, 1722, 1085, 472, 160, 14, 1695, 1, 11845, 23, 162, 79, 6, 49, 1934, 16396, 23, 218, 33, 335, 81, 503, 2, 1112, 5757, 23, 218, 27, 394, 81, 503, 11845, 61, 10, 133, 78, 27, 7, 233, 33, 78, 27, 7, 2, 167, 78, 49, 7, 381, 28, 14, 33, 381, 936, 391, 160, 18, 1695, 1, 3906, 3667, 23, 162, 133, 6, 66, 2796, 4810, 1538, 11845, 23, 162, 66, 6, 39, 2, 16396, 23, 218, 27, 201, 81, 503, 11845, 61, 10, 133, 78, 203, 2, 233, 33, 78, 18, 381, 28, 14, 33, 381, 936, 391, 160, 14, 42, 133, 7, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 466, 60, 437, 7, 42, 504, 3368, 492, 2, 49, 42, 157, 3713, 39714, 83, 5, 3112, 799, 1, 581, 2223, 29, 79, 1096, 33, 5, 1033, 2438, 259, 772, 2, 18, 5, 35366, 77, 61, 817, 385, 11, 164, 2627, 7, 513, 236, 734, 28, 218, 201, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 213, 481, 53, 33, 7, 958, 4, 236, 734, 29, 233, 33, 567, 67, 53, 160, 18, 42, 179, 7, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 605, 60, 3170, 7, 42, 492, 2, 33, 42, 39714, 18, 4, 419, 429, 326, 5, 581, 2438, 27, 394, 2, 233, 5, 672, 2438, 49, 676, 88, 39, 61, 817, 385, 11, 527, 28, 233, 33, 381, 4486, 2, 6667, 4486, 10, 3, 96, 908, 155, 4, 110, 143, 11845, 61, 1125, 6, 167, 381, 16, 899, 198, 397, 5, 5757, 16396, 2, 16, 41, 5, 1595, 385, 2, 2269, 123, 11845, 61, 1125, 16, 44, 899, 5, 3667, 16396, 520, 6, 61, 817, 385, 508, 1413, 303, 1222, 23, 317, 195, 61, 1125, 5, 5757, 16396, 16, 1165, 5, 3, 1326, 1, 1673, 34, 182, 4, 26, 64, 43, 266]",2013.0,22592050,Dose escalation total marrow irradiation concurrent chemotherapy patients advanced acute leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation,1,0.001092896174863388
Differential effects of radiotherapy on growth and endocrine function among acute leukemia survivors: a childhood cancer survivor study report.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-05-24,"The differential effects of cranial radiotherapy (CRT), spinal radiotherapy (SRT), and total body irradiation (TBI) on growth and endocrine outcomes have rarely been examined in combination among childhood acute leukemia survivors. Self-reported height/weight, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy/live birth were determined among acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia survivors (n = 3,467) participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, an ongoing cohort study of 5-year survivors of pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986. Compared with no radiotherapy, risk estimates were consistent across outcomes (adult short stature, hypothyroidism, absence of pregnancy/live birth) with CRT treatment associated with 2-3-fold increased risks, TBI associated with 5-10 fold increased risks, and CRT + TBI associated with >10 fold increased risks. Exposure to any SRT further increased risk of these outcomes 2-3-fold.

To examine whether intensive insulin therapy could improve outcomes, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy. Intensive insulin did not improve ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes. Hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, with methylprednisolone premedication) chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control). Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level >180 mg/dL on ≥2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled. The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I/C) > 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS. In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0002), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0016), and average glucose level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0236). Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age ≥ 60 years (P = .0008), I/C ≥ 0.175 (P = .0002), high systemic risk (P = .0173) and average glucose level ≥ 180 mg/dL (P = .0249). I/C ≥ 0.175 was the only significant (P = .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration.

Differential impact of structurally different anti-diabetic drugs on proliferation and chemosensitivity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",Cell Cycle,2012-06-15,"Hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Cancer 2004; 100: 1179-85). The optimal clinical strategy to manage hyperglycemia during hyper-CVAD is unclear. To examine whether anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy can influence chemosensitivity of ALL cells, we examined the impacts of different anti-diabetic agents on ALL cell lines and patient samples. Pharmacologically achievable concentrations of insulin, aspart and glargine significantly increased the number of ALL cells, and aspart and glargine did so at lower concentrations than human insulin. In contrast, metformin and rosiglitazone significantly decreased the cell number. Human insulin and analogs activated AKT/mTOR signaling and stimulated ALL cell proliferation (as measured by flow cytometric methods), but metformin and rosiglitazone blocked AKT/mTOR signaling and inhibited proliferation. Metformin 500 μM and rosiglitazone 10 μM were found to sensitize Reh cells to daunorubicin, while aspart, glargine and human insulin (all at 1.25 mIU/L) enhanced chemoresistance. Metformin and rosiglitazone enhanced daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, while insulin, aspart and glargine antagonized daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. In addition, metformin increased etoposide-induced and L-asparaginase-induced apoptosis; rosiglitazone increased etoposide-induced and vincristine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that use of insulins to control hyperglycemia in ALL patients may contribute to anthracycline chemoresistance, while metformin and thiazolidinediones may improve chemosensitivity to anthracycline as well as other chemotherapy drugs through their different impacts on AKT/mTOR signaling in leukemic cells. Our data suggest that the choice of anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy during chemotherapy may influence clinical outcomes in ALL.",Journal Article,2776.0,,Hyperglycemia hyper-CVAD chemotherapy associated poor outcomes acute lymphoblastic leukemia 2004 100 1179-85 optimal clinical strategy manage hyperglycemia hyper-CVAD unclear examine anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy influence chemosensitivity examined impacts different anti-diabetic agents lines patient Pharmacologically achievable concentrations insulin aspart glargine significantly increased number aspart glargine lower concentrations human insulin contrast metformin rosiglitazone significantly decreased number Human insulin analogs activated AKT/mTOR signaling stimulated proliferation measured flow cytometric methods metformin rosiglitazone blocked AKT/mTOR signaling inhibited proliferation Metformin 500 μM rosiglitazone 10 μM sensitize Reh daunorubicin aspart glargine human insulin 1.25 mIU/L enhanced chemoresistance Metformin rosiglitazone enhanced daunorubicin-induced apoptosis insulin aspart glargine antagonized daunorubicin-induced apoptosis addition metformin increased etoposide-induced L-asparaginase-induced apoptosis rosiglitazone increased etoposide-induced vincristine-induced apoptosis suggest use insulins control hyperglycemia patients contribute anthracycline chemoresistance metformin thiazolidinediones improve chemosensitivity anthracycline chemotherapy drugs different impacts AKT/mTOR signaling leukemic suggest choice anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy chemotherapy influence clinical outcomes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3992, 190, 4855, 5574, 56, 16, 41, 5, 334, 123, 1, 286, 1275, 62, 12, 1131, 394, 24966, 772, 3, 665, 38, 692, 6, 4001, 3992, 190, 4855, 5574, 16, 1200, 6, 1004, 317, 312, 5943, 14878, 122, 1054, 5522, 1, 62, 37, 21, 409, 3, 4719, 1, 338, 312, 5943, 183, 23, 62, 31, 285, 2, 69, 347, 7854, 6171, 1003, 1, 1601, 27187, 2, 27186, 97, 101, 3, 207, 1, 62, 37, 2, 27187, 2, 27186, 205, 1743, 28, 280, 1003, 76, 171, 1601, 4, 748, 2791, 2, 9046, 97, 340, 3, 31, 207, 171, 1601, 2, 4063, 735, 649, 873, 314, 2, 2816, 62, 31, 457, 22, 644, 20, 1412, 6226, 636, 84, 2791, 2, 9046, 2582, 649, 873, 314, 2, 879, 457, 2791, 1666, 4810, 2, 9046, 79, 4810, 11, 204, 6, 5745, 23340, 37, 6, 5247, 369, 27187, 27186, 2, 171, 1601, 62, 28, 14, 243, 8356, 805, 651, 3782, 2791, 2, 9046, 651, 5247, 277, 351, 369, 1601, 27187, 2, 27186, 15259, 5247, 277, 351, 4, 352, 2791, 101, 1934, 277, 2, 805, 3709, 277, 351, 9046, 101, 1934, 277, 2, 2132, 277, 351, 4, 1221, 114, 99, 309, 17, 119, 1, 61530, 6, 182, 3992, 4, 62, 7, 68, 1248, 6, 2044, 3782, 369, 2791, 2, 23153, 68, 401, 5522, 6, 2044, 22, 149, 22, 127, 56, 600, 298, 136, 338, 4719, 23, 649, 873, 314, 4, 2015, 37, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3, 1866, 1, 312, 5943, 14878, 190, 56, 68, 1054, 38, 123, 4, 62]",1840.0,22659796,Differential impact structurally different anti-diabetic drugs proliferation chemosensitivity acute lymphoblastic leukemia,4,0.004371584699453552

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of central nervous system directed therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-06-12,"Treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) is an essential therapy component for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Individual patient data from 47 trials addressing 16 CNS treatment comparisons were analyzed. Event-free survival (EFS) was similar for radiotherapy versus intrathecal (IT), and radiotherapy plus IT versus IV methotrexate (IV MTX) plus IT.

How I treat hematologic emergencies in adults with acute leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-06-13,"Acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain devastating diseases. Only approximately 40% of younger and 10% of older adults are long-term survivors. Although curing the leukemia is always the most formidable challenge, complications from the disease itself and its treatment are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Such complications, discussed herein, include tumor lysis, hyperleukocytosis, cytarabine-induced cellebellar toxicity, acute promyelocytic leukemia differentiation syndrome, thrombohemorrhagic syndrome in acute promyelocytic leukemia, L-asparaginase-associated thrombosis, leukemic meningitis, neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis, and transfussion-associated GVHD. Whereas clinical trials form the backbone for the management of acute leukemia, emergent clinical situations, predictable or not, are common and do not readily lend themselves to clinical trial evaluation. Furthermore, practice guidelines are often lacking. Not only are prospective trials impractical because of the emergent nature of the issue at hand, but clinicians are often reluctant to randomize such patients. Extensive practical experience is crucial and, even if there is no consensus, management of such emergencies should be guided by an understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",Case Reports,2778.0,40.0,Acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain devastating diseases approximately 40 younger 10 older adults long-term survivors curing leukemia formidable challenge complications disease treatment associated significant morbidity mortality complications discussed include lysis hyperleukocytosis cytarabine-induced cellebellar toxicity acute promyelocytic leukemia differentiation syndrome thrombohemorrhagic syndrome acute promyelocytic leukemia L-asparaginase-associated thrombosis leukemic meningitis neutropenic fever neutropenic enterocolitis transfussion-associated GVHD clinical trials form backbone management acute leukemia emergent clinical situations predictable common readily lend clinical trial evaluation Furthermore practice guidelines lacking prospective trials impractical emergent nature issue hand clinicians reluctant randomize patients Extensive practical experience crucial consensus management emergencies guided understanding underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 533, 2, 286, 1275, 918, 5778, 1342, 158, 705, 327, 1, 773, 2, 79, 1, 434, 857, 32, 319, 337, 332, 242, 12775, 3, 16, 3763, 3, 96, 11940, 1745, 521, 29, 3, 34, 4045, 2, 211, 24, 32, 41, 5, 93, 787, 2, 282, 225, 521, 1588, 1986, 643, 30, 4783, 15558, 1855, 277, 61572, 155, 286, 4300, 910, 681, 35385, 681, 4, 286, 4300, 805, 3709, 41, 2839, 2015, 10792, 3659, 2775, 3659, 14829, 2, 61573, 41, 1562, 547, 38, 143, 1297, 3, 7066, 9, 3, 284, 1, 286, 4348, 38, 5990, 7639, 15, 44, 32, 186, 2, 1022, 44, 3860, 12248, 5374, 6, 38, 160, 451, 798, 758, 677, 32, 629, 1941, 44, 158, 32, 482, 143, 16835, 408, 1, 3, 4348, 2202, 1, 3, 2537, 28, 2833, 84, 1490, 32, 629, 14770, 6, 26129, 225, 7, 1344, 3320, 730, 16, 2653, 2, 871, 492, 125, 16, 77, 1391, 284, 1, 225, 31618, 257, 40, 1808, 20, 35, 612, 1, 3, 1181, 11575, 483]",1252.0,22700723,treat hematologic emergencies adults acute leukemia,3,0.003278688524590164
Absolute lymphocyte count at day 28 independently predicts event-free and overall survival in adults with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2012-06-22,"We investigated the prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) following induction chemotherapy in newly diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with ALC ≥350 cells/μL at day 28 had a median overall survival (OS) of 47.4 months when compared with 17.6 months for those with an ALC <350 cells/μL (HR = 1.98, P = 0.007). Among patients who achieved a complete remission, median event-free survival (EFS) for those with ALC ≥350 cells/μL on day 28 was 42.1 months when compared with 13.9 months in those with ALC <350 cells/μL (HR = 2.08, P = 0.006). In multivariable analysis, the ALC on day 28 (<350 cells/μL vs. ≥350 cells/μL, P ≤ .0004 for OS and EFS) along with WBC at diagnosis (≤6.0 or >30.0 K/μL vs. >6.0-30.0 K/μL, P ≤ 0.002 for OS and EFS) and cytogenetics (abnormal vs. normal, P = 0.002 for OS and P = 0.02 for EFS) were independent prognostic factors of both OS and EFS.

One hundred sixty-one eligible, previously untreated patients ages 16 to 82 years (median age, 40 years) were enrolled, and 33 (20%) were aged ≥60 years. One hundred twenty-eight patients (80%) achieved complete remission (CR). Dose intensification of daunorubicin and cytarabine was feasible. At a median follow-up of 10.4 years for surviving patients, the 5-year DFS rate was 25% (95% confidence interval, 18%-33%), and the overall survival (OS) rate was 30% (95% confidence interval, 23%-37%).

Fifty-one patients (median age, 36 years; range, 20-64 years) received a matched sibling (n = 24), syngeneic (n = 2), or matched unrelated donor transplant (n = 25) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission (n = 30), second complete remission (n = 13), or active disease (n = 8). More than one-half of the patients had a high-risk cytogenetic profile, as defined by the presence of t(9;22) (n = 17), t(4;11) (n = 3), or complex cytogenetics (n = 7). Clo 40 mg/m(2) was given once daily, with each dose followed by pharmacokinetically dosed Bu infused over 3 hours daily for 4 days, followed by hematopoietic SCT 2 days later. The Bu dose was based on drug clearance, as determined by the patient's response to a 32-mg/m(2) Bu test dose given 48 hours before the high-dose regimen. The target daily area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 5500 μM/min for patients age <60 years and 4000 μM/min for those age ≥60 years. The regimen was well tolerated, with a 100-day nonrelapse mortality rate of 6%.

PACSIN2 polymorphism influences TPMT activity and mercaptopurine-related gastrointestinal toxicity.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2012-07-30,"Treatment-related toxicity can be life-threatening and is the primary cause of interruption or discontinuation of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), leading to an increased risk of relapse. Mercaptopurine is an essential component of continuation therapy in all ALL treatment protocols worldwide. Genetic polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) are known to have a marked effect on mercaptopurine metabolism and toxicity; however, some patients with wild-type TPMT develop toxicity during mercaptopurine treatment for reasons that are not well understood. To identify additional genetic determinants of mercaptopurine toxicity, a genome-wide analysis was performed in a panel of human HapMap cell lines to identify trans-acting genes whose expression and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are related to TPMT activity, then validated in patients with ALL. The highest ranking gene with both mRNA expression and SNPs associated with TPMT activity in HapMap cell lines was protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 (PACSIN2). The association of a PACSIN2 SNP (rs2413739) with TPMT activity was confirmed in patients and knock-down of PACSIN2 mRNA in human leukemia cells (NALM6) resulted in significantly lower TPMT activity. Moreover, this PACSIN2 SNP was significantly associated with the incidence of severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity during consolidation therapy containing mercaptopurine, and remained significant in a multivariate analysis including TPMT and SLCO1B1 as covariates, consistent with its influence on TPMT activity. The association with GI toxicity was also validated in a separate cohort of pediatric patients with ALL. These data indicate that polymorphism in PACSIN2 significantly modulates TPMT activity and influences the risk of GI toxicity associated with mercaptopurine therapy.",Journal Article,2731.0,39.0,Treatment-related toxicity life-threatening primary cause interruption discontinuation chemotherapy acute lymphoblastic leukemia leading increased risk relapse Mercaptopurine essential component continuation therapy treatment protocols worldwide Genetic polymorphisms thiopurine S-methyltransferase TPMT known marked effect mercaptopurine metabolism toxicity patients wild-type TPMT develop toxicity mercaptopurine treatment reasons understood identify additional genetic determinants mercaptopurine toxicity genome-wide performed panel human HapMap lines identify trans-acting expression and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs related TPMT activity validated patients highest ranking mRNA expression SNPs associated TPMT activity HapMap lines kinase C casein kinase substrate neurons 2 PACSIN2 association PACSIN2 SNP rs2413739 TPMT activity confirmed patients knock-down PACSIN2 mRNA human leukemia NALM6 resulted significantly lower TPMT activity PACSIN2 SNP significantly associated incidence severe gastrointestinal GI toxicity consolidation therapy containing mercaptopurine remained significant multivariate including TPMT SLCO1B1 covariates consistent influence TPMT activity association GI toxicity validated separate cohort pediatric patients indicate polymorphism PACSIN2 significantly modulates TPMT activity influences risk GI toxicity associated mercaptopurine therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 139, 155, 122, 40, 358, 3691, 2, 16, 3, 86, 708, 1, 4823, 15, 2007, 1, 56, 9, 286, 1275, 62, 1049, 6, 35, 101, 43, 1, 429, 9223, 16, 35, 1452, 1249, 1, 6870, 36, 4, 62, 62, 24, 2189, 2358, 336, 1203, 4, 14062, 695, 3747, 14852, 32, 440, 6, 47, 8, 2003, 254, 23, 9223, 1600, 2, 155, 137, 476, 7, 5, 955, 267, 14852, 690, 155, 190, 9223, 24, 9, 2325, 17, 32, 44, 149, 1784, 6, 255, 402, 336, 3403, 1, 9223, 155, 8, 898, 1019, 65, 10, 173, 4, 8, 993, 1, 171, 13961, 31, 285, 6, 255, 3437, 5375, 214, 1310, 55, 2, 15, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 32, 139, 6, 14852, 128, 818, 938, 4, 7, 5, 62, 3, 1076, 11185, 145, 5, 110, 956, 55, 2, 1109, 41, 5, 14852, 128, 4, 13961, 31, 285, 10, 178, 216, 256, 2, 18145, 216, 4235, 4, 11930, 18, 32011, 3, 248, 1, 8, 32011, 1845, 61717, 5, 14852, 128, 10, 557, 4, 7, 2, 6252, 1328, 1, 32011, 956, 4, 171, 37, 40068, 627, 4, 97, 280, 14852, 128, 1393, 26, 32011, 1845, 10, 97, 41, 5, 3, 287, 1, 905, 2104, 155, 190, 2173, 36, 1101, 9223, 2, 958, 93, 4, 8, 331, 65, 141, 14852, 2, 13693, 22, 2489, 925, 5, 211, 1054, 23, 14852, 128, 3, 248, 5, 2104, 155, 10, 120, 938, 4, 8, 2282, 180, 1, 815, 7, 5, 62, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 1907, 4, 32011, 97, 5259, 14852, 128, 2, 3859, 3, 43, 1, 2104, 155, 41, 5, 9223, 36]",1799.0,22846425,PACSIN2 polymorphism influences TPMT activity mercaptopurine-related gastrointestinal toxicity,19,0.020765027322404372

Most of these children will achieve a second complete remission, but maintaining this remission remains difficult. Because relapsed ALL is such a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, it is the focus of much research interest. Efforts have been made and continue to focus on understanding the underlying biology that drives relapse.

Functional and structural differences in the hippocampus associated with memory deficits in adult survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-08-08,"Radiation and chemotherapy targeted to the central nervous system (CNS) can cause cognitive impairment, including impaired memory. These memory impairments may be referable to damage to hippocampal structures resulting from CNS treatment. In the present study, we explored episodic memory and its neuroimaging correlates in 10 adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with cranial radiation therapy and both systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy and 10 controls matched for age and sex, using a subsequent memory paradigm after episodic encoding of visual scenes. We report behavioral, structural, and functional changes in the brains of the adult survivors. They demonstrated poorer recognition memory, hippocampal atrophy, and altered blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the hippocampus. Whole brain statistical map analysis revealed increased BOLD signal/activation in several brain regions during unsuccessful encoding in ALL survivors, potentially reflecting ineffective neural recruitment. Individual differences in memory performance in ALL participants were related to magnitude of BOLD response in regions associated with successful encoding.

Association of bone mineral density with incidental renal stone in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2012-09-06,"Our objective was to evaluate the association between low bone mineral density (BMD) and incidental renal stones among long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Adult participants who were 10+ years from their childhood ALL diagnosis and members of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study were recruited between December 2007 and March 2011. During their risk-based medical evaluations, they underwent quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to evaluate BMD. Incidental renal stones were identified by radiologists' review of axial QCT source images. Demographic and dietary information were abstracted from health surveys and the Block Food Frequency questionnaire, respectively. The multivariable logistic regression model was used for analysis. At a median of 26.1 years from diagnosis, BMD Z scores were ≤-2 in 34 of 662 (5.2 %) and renal stones detected in 73 of 662 (11 %) participants.

Genome-wide association study identifies germline polymorphisms associated with relapse of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-09-24,"With the use of risk-directed therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), outcome has improved dramatically in the past 40 years. However, a substantial portion of patients, many of whom have no known risk factors, experience relapse. Taking a genome-wide approach, in the present study, we evaluated the relationships between genotypes at 444 044 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of relapse in 2535 children with newly diagnosed ALL after adjusting for genetic ancestry and treatment regimen. We identified 134 SNPs that were reproducibly associated with ALL relapse. Of 134 relapse SNPs, 133 remained prognostic after adjusting for all known relapse risk factors, including minimal residual disease, and 111 were significant even among patients who were negative for minimal residual disease after remission induction therapy. The C allele at rs7142143 in the PYGL gene was associated with 3.6-fold higher risk of relapse than the T allele (P = 6.7 × 10(-9)).

Population PK/PD model of homocysteine concentrations after high-dose methotrexate treatment in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-25,"Elevated homocysteine concentrations have been associated with methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity. Based on methotrexate and homocysteine plasma concentrations of 494 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high-dose methotrexate in the TOTAL XV study, a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model was built with NONMEM. Several compartment and indirect response models were investigated. The pharmacokinetic disposition of methotrexate was best described by a two-compartment model. Homocysteine concentrations were included by an indirect response model where methotrexate inhibition of the homocysteine elimination rate was described by an E(max) model. The homocysteine baseline level was found to be age-dependent. Simulations revealed that folinate rescue therapy does not affect peak concentrations of homocysteine but leads to a modestly reduced homocysteine exposure.

Treatment of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a focus on emerging investigational and targeted therapies.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2012-09-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is a very challenging disease. Adults tend to present with higher-risk features and are unable to tolerate chemotherapy regimens as intense as those administered to children. The overall treatment plan for adult ALL is modeled after the pediatric paradigm and includes multi-agent chemotherapy in the forms of induction, consolidation, maintenance, and central nervous system prophylaxis. Most patients will go into complete remission but often relapse; relapse is typically indicative of chemotherapy-refractory disease. Salvage therapy generally consists of cytotoxic agents from drug classes the patient has had limited or no exposure to. The results of conventional chemotherapy for relapsed ALL are unacceptable. The goal of therapy in these patients is to achieve a second remission followed by allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Monoclonal antibodies directed at cell-surface antigens offer a targeted approach to treating leukemia and other cancers. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to improve survival when used in the frontline setting. Novel, highly active antibodies directed at CD19 and CD22 are being investigated in the relapsed and refractory settings.

Deep-sequencing approach for minimal residual disease detection in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-10-16,"The persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during therapy is the strongest adverse prognostic factor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We developed a high-throughput sequencing method that universally amplifies antigen-receptor gene segments and identifies all clonal gene rearrangements (ie, leukemia-specific sequences) at diagnosis, allowing monitoring of disease progression and clonal evolution during therapy. In the present study, the assay specifically detected 1 leukemic cell among greater than 1 million leukocytes in spike-in experiments. We compared this method with the gold-standard MRD assays multiparameter flow cytometry and allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) using diagnostic and follow-up samples from 106 patients with ALL. Sequencing detected MRD in all 28 samples shown to be positive by flow cytometry and in 35 of the 36 shown to be positive by ASO-PCR and revealed MRD in 10 and 3 additional samples that were negative by flow cytometry and ASO-PCR, respectively.

Integrative epigenomic analysis identifies biomarkers and therapeutic targets in adult B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2012-10-29,"Genetic lesions such as BCR-ABL1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (MLLr) are associated with unfavorable outcomes in adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Leukemia oncoproteins may directly or indirectly disrupt cytosine methylation patterning to mediate the malignant phenotype. We postulated that DNA methylation signatures in these aggressive B-ALLs would point toward disease mechanisms and useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We therefore conducted DNA methylation and gene expression profiling on a cohort of 215 adult patients with B-ALL enrolled in a single phase III clinical trial (ECOG E2993) and normal control B cells. In BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant cytosine methylation patterning centered around a cytokine network defined by hypomethylation and overexpression of IL2RA(CD25). The E2993 trial clinical data showed that CD25 expression was strongly associated with a poor outcome in patients with ALL regardless of BCR-ABL1 status, suggesting CD25 as a novel prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in B-ALLs. In E2A-PBX1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant DNA methylation patterning was strongly associated with direct fusion protein binding as shown by the E2A-PBX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq), suggesting that E2A-PBX1 fusion protein directly remodels the epigenome to impose an aggressive B-ALL phenotype. MLLr B-ALL featured prominent cytosine hypomethylation, which was linked with MLL fusion protein binding, H3K79 dimethylation, and transcriptional upregulation, affecting a set of known and newly identified MLL fusion direct targets with oncogenic activity such as FLT3 and BCL6. Notably, BCL6 blockade or loss of function suppressed proliferation and survival of MLLr leukemia cells, suggesting BCL6-targeted therapy as a new therapeutic strategy for MLLr B-ALLs. We conducted the first integrative epigenomic study in adult B-ALLs, as a correlative study to the ECOG E2993 phase III clinical trial. This study links for the first time the direct actions of oncogenic fusion proteins with disruption of epigenetic regulation mediated by cytosine methylation. We identify a novel clinically actionable biomarker in B-ALLs: IL2RA (CD25), which is linked with BCR-ABL1 and an inflammatory signaling network associated with chemotherapy resistance. We show that BCL6 is a novel MLL fusion protein target that is required to maintain the proliferation and survival of primary human adult MLLr cells and provide the basis for a clinical trial with BCL6 inhibitors for patients with MLLr.",Journal Article,2640.0,49.0,Genetic lesions BCR-ABL1 E2A-PBX1 MLL rearrangements MLLr associated unfavorable outcomes adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL Leukemia oncoproteins directly indirectly disrupt cytosine methylation patterning mediate malignant phenotype postulated DNA methylation signatures aggressive B-ALLs point disease mechanisms useful biomarkers therapeutic targets conducted DNA methylation expression profiling cohort 215 adult patients B-ALL enrolled single phase III clinical trial ECOG E2993 normal control B BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALLs aberrant cytosine methylation patterning centered cytokine network defined hypomethylation overexpression IL2RA CD25 E2993 trial clinical showed CD25 expression strongly associated poor outcome patients regardless BCR-ABL1 status suggesting CD25 novel prognostic biomarker risk stratification B-ALLs E2A-PBX1-positive B-ALLs aberrant DNA methylation patterning strongly associated direct fusion binding shown E2A-PBX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP sequencing ChIP-seq suggesting E2A-PBX1 fusion directly remodels epigenome impose aggressive B-ALL phenotype MLLr B-ALL featured prominent cytosine hypomethylation linked MLL fusion binding H3K79 dimethylation transcriptional upregulation affecting set known newly identified MLL fusion direct targets oncogenic activity FLT3 BCL6 Notably BCL6 blockade loss function suppressed proliferation survival MLLr leukemia suggesting BCL6-targeted therapy new therapeutic strategy MLLr B-ALLs conducted integrative epigenomic adult B-ALLs correlative ECOG E2993 phase III clinical trial links time direct actions oncogenic fusion disruption epigenetic regulation mediated cytosine methylation identify novel clinically actionable biomarker B-ALLs IL2RA CD25 linked BCR-ABL1 inflammatory signaling network associated chemotherapy resistance BCL6 novel MLL fusion target required maintain proliferation survival primary human adult MLLr provide basis clinical trial BCL6 inhibitors patients MLLr,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[336, 406, 225, 22, 1062, 3557, 15127, 14434, 2, 3049, 2072, 29366, 32, 41, 5, 2483, 123, 4, 780, 132, 31, 2765, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 8241, 68, 1606, 15, 7792, 6619, 6903, 569, 23991, 6, 3367, 3, 393, 1005, 21, 6507, 17, 261, 569, 2210, 4, 46, 571, 132, 10706, 688, 741, 1317, 34, 483, 2, 999, 582, 2, 189, 637, 21, 673, 426, 261, 569, 2, 145, 55, 1080, 23, 8, 180, 1, 6511, 780, 7, 5, 132, 62, 346, 4, 8, 226, 124, 316, 38, 160, 2351, 28928, 2, 295, 182, 132, 37, 4, 1062, 3557, 109, 132, 10706, 1898, 6903, 569, 23991, 4846, 3337, 8, 1675, 1801, 395, 20, 4441, 2, 851, 1, 27229, 4531, 3, 28928, 160, 38, 74, 224, 17, 4531, 55, 10, 1327, 41, 5, 8, 334, 228, 4, 7, 5, 62, 1583, 1, 1062, 3557, 156, 802, 4531, 22, 8, 229, 177, 901, 9, 43, 1541, 4, 132, 10706, 4, 15127, 14434, 109, 132, 10706, 1898, 261, 569, 23991, 10, 1327, 41, 5, 1196, 1212, 178, 791, 22, 443, 20, 3, 15127, 14434, 2287, 4857, 4222, 615, 4222, 4185, 802, 17, 15127, 14434, 1212, 178, 1606, 35464, 3, 10206, 6, 15099, 35, 571, 132, 62, 1005, 29366, 132, 62, 11857, 3689, 6903, 4441, 92, 10, 1199, 5, 3049, 1212, 178, 791, 23715, 25086, 2, 1431, 2218, 2319, 8, 916, 1, 440, 2, 732, 108, 3049, 1212, 1196, 637, 5, 1302, 128, 225, 22, 1224, 2, 8148, 2552, 8148, 1189, 15, 407, 1, 343, 1908, 457, 2, 25, 1, 29366, 37, 802, 8148, 238, 36, 22, 8, 217, 189, 692, 9, 29366, 132, 10706, 21, 426, 3, 157, 4324, 9822, 45, 4, 780, 132, 10706, 22, 8, 3679, 45, 6, 3, 2351, 28928, 124, 316, 38, 160, 26, 45, 6491, 9, 3, 157, 98, 3, 1196, 5592, 1, 1302, 1212, 652, 5, 3220, 1, 1418, 863, 517, 20, 6903, 569, 21, 255, 8, 229, 505, 2856, 901, 4, 132, 10706, 27229, 4531, 92, 16, 1199, 5, 1062, 3557, 2, 35, 1291, 314, 1801, 41, 5, 56, 251, 21, 514, 17, 8148, 16, 8, 229, 3049, 1212, 178, 283, 17, 16, 616, 6, 3040, 3, 457, 2, 25, 1, 86, 171, 780, 29366, 37, 2, 377, 3, 877, 9, 8, 38, 160, 5, 8148, 222, 9, 7, 5, 29366]",2503.0,23107779,Integrative epigenomic identifies biomarkers therapeutic targets adult B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia,11,0.012021857923497269
Trends in transfusion burden among long-term survivors of childhood hematological malignancies.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2012-12-22,"The risk from cumulative erythrocyte transfusions is poorly understood in oncology populations. This analysis among long-term survivors explored variation in transfusional burden over progressive eras of treatment identifying those at risk for iron overload. Transfusion records of 982 survivors of hematological malignancies treated at St. Jude were reviewed. After exclusions, 881 (90%) were assessed for cumulative volume, weight-adjusted volume and transfusion number. Treatment intensity was assigned using the Intensity of Treatment Rating Scale version 3.0 (ITR-3). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant and acute myeloid leukemia survivors had greater transfusional burden than conventional therapy recipients and acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors, respectively. Survivors of 5-10 years were more likely than survivors of > 10 years to receive ≥ 10 transfusions (odds ratio = 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.5-2.8).

Continuous Versus Bolus Infusion of Doxorubicin in Children With ALL: Long-term Cardiac Outcomes.,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,2012-11-19,"Doxorubicin, effective against many malignancies, is limited by cardiotoxicity. Continuous-infusion doxorubicin, compared with bolus-infusion, reduces early cardiotoxicity in adults. Its effectiveness in reducing late cardiotoxicity in children remains uncertain. We determined continuous-infusion doxorubicin cardioprotective efficacy in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 91-01 enrolled pediatric patients between 1991 and 1995. Newly diagnosed high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive a total of 360 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin in 30 mg/m(2) doses every 3 weeks, by either continuous (over 48 hours) or bolus-infusion (within 15 minutes). Echocardiograms at baseline, during, and after doxorubicin therapy were blindly remeasured centrally. Primary outcomes were late left ventricular (LV) structure and function. A total of 102 children were randomized to each treatment group. We analyzed 484 serial echocardiograms from 92 patients (n = 49 continuous; n = 43 bolus) with ≥1 echocardiogram ≥3 years after assignment. Both groups had similar demographics and normal baseline LV characteristics. Cardiac follow-up after randomization (median, 8 years) showed changes from baseline within the randomized groups (depressed systolic function, systolic dilation, reduced wall thickness, and reduced mass) at 3, 6, and 8 years; there were no statistically significant differences between randomized groups. Ten-year ALL event-free survival rates did not differ between the 2 groups (continuous-infusion, 83% versus bolus-infusion, 78%; P = .24). In survivors of childhood high-risk ALL, continuous-infusion doxorubicin, compared with bolus-infusion, provided no long-term cardioprotection or improvement in ALL event-free survival, hence provided no benefit over bolus-infusion.",Comparative Study,2619.0,88.0,Doxorubicin effective malignancies limited cardiotoxicity Continuous-infusion doxorubicin compared bolus-infusion reduces early cardiotoxicity adults effectiveness reducing late cardiotoxicity children remains uncertain determined continuous-infusion doxorubicin cardioprotective efficacy long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Dana-Farber Institute Consortium Protocol 91-01 enrolled pediatric patients 1991 1995 Newly diagnosed high-risk patients randomly assigned receive total 360 mg/m 2 doxorubicin 30 mg/m 2 doses 3 weeks continuous 48 hours bolus-infusion 15 minutes Echocardiograms baseline doxorubicin therapy blindly remeasured centrally Primary outcomes late left ventricular LV structure function total 102 children randomized treatment group 484 serial echocardiograms 92 patients n 49 continuous n 43 bolus ≥1 echocardiogram ≥3 years assignment groups similar demographics normal baseline LV characteristics Cardiac follow-up randomization median 8 years showed changes baseline randomized groups depressed systolic function systolic dilation reduced wall thickness reduced mass 3 6 8 years statistically significant differences randomized groups Ten-year event-free survival rates differ 2 groups continuous-infusion 83 versus bolus-infusion 78 P .24 survivors childhood high-risk continuous-infusion doxorubicin compared bolus-infusion provided long-term cardioprotection improvement event-free survival provided benefit bolus-infusion,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[856, 323, 480, 445, 441, 16, 383, 20, 4404, 1314, 904, 856, 72, 5, 3604, 904, 2389, 191, 4404, 4, 857, 211, 1236, 4, 1818, 807, 4404, 4, 541, 469, 2717, 21, 509, 1314, 904, 856, 17618, 209, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 3, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 62, 2404, 1182, 970, 355, 346, 815, 7, 59, 3372, 2, 2323, 732, 265, 64, 43, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 8, 181, 1, 6739, 81, 188, 18, 1, 856, 4, 201, 81, 188, 18, 415, 454, 27, 244, 20, 361, 1314, 252, 576, 1459, 15, 3604, 904, 262, 167, 2511, 15097, 28, 330, 190, 2, 50, 856, 36, 11, 18490, 42870, 4604, 86, 123, 11, 807, 1712, 4028, 4072, 2772, 2, 343, 8, 181, 1, 2867, 541, 11, 384, 6, 296, 24, 87, 21, 311, 9802, 2108, 15097, 29, 937, 7, 78, 739, 1314, 78, 601, 3604, 5, 3567, 11906, 2608, 60, 50, 4392, 110, 271, 42, 288, 2221, 2, 295, 330, 4072, 374, 166, 126, 50, 3644, 52, 66, 60, 224, 400, 29, 330, 262, 3, 384, 271, 9233, 8109, 343, 8109, 8062, 405, 2397, 2903, 2, 405, 782, 28, 27, 49, 2, 66, 60, 125, 11, 77, 712, 93, 362, 59, 384, 271, 1618, 111, 62, 774, 115, 25, 151, 205, 44, 1505, 59, 3, 18, 271, 1314, 904, 852, 185, 3604, 904, 833, 19, 259, 4, 332, 1, 864, 64, 43, 62, 1314, 904, 856, 72, 5, 3604, 904, 1052, 77, 319, 337, 23760, 15, 767, 4, 62, 774, 115, 25, 3665, 1052, 77, 247, 252, 3604, 904]",1795.0,23166343,Continuous Versus Bolus Infusion Doxorubicin Children Long-term Cardiac Outcomes,0,0.0
"High-dose vincristine sulfate liposome injection for advanced, relapsed, and refractory adult Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-11-19,"Relapsed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with high reinduction mortality, chemotherapy resistance, and rapid progression leading to death. Vincristine sulfate liposome injection (VSLI), sphingomyelin and cholesterol nanoparticle vincristine (VCR), facilitates VCR dose-intensification and densification plus enhances target tissue delivery. We evaluated high-dose VSLI monotherapy in adults with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -negative ALL that was multiply relapsed, relapsed and refractory to reinduction, and/or relapsed after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Sixty-five adults with Ph-negative ALL in second or greater relapse or whose disease had progressed following two or more leukemia therapies were treated in this pivotal phase II, multinational trial. Intravenous VSLI 2.25 mg/m(2), without dose capping, was administered once per week until response, progression, toxicity, or pursuit of HCT. The primary end point was achievement of complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). The CR/CRi rate was 20% and overall response rate was 35%. VSLI monotherapy was effective as third-, fourth-, and fifth-line therapy and in patients refractory to other single- and multiagent reinduction therapies. Median CR/CRi duration was 23 weeks (range, 5 to 66 weeks); 12 patients bridged to a post-VSLI HCT, and five patients were long-term survivors.

Herein, we developed novel milatuzumab-conjugated liposomes as a targeted dexamethasone carrier for therapeutic delivery in CD74(+) B-cell malignancies and explored its effect against the disease. The targeting efficiency of milatuzumab-targeted liposomes to CD74(+) cells was evaluated in vitro. The effect of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was compared with free dexamethasone in primary CLL cells and cell lines in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was evaluated in a Raji-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) xenograft model in vivo. Milatuzumab-targeted liposomes promoted selective incorporation of carrier molecules into transformed CD74-positive B cells as compared with CD74-negative T-cells. The CD74-dexamethasone-targeted liposomes (CD74-IL-DEX) promoted and increased killing in CD74-positive tumor cells and primary CLL cells. Furthermore, the targeted drug liposomes showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy against a CD74-positive B-cell model as compared with free, or non-targeted, liposomal dexamethasone in SCID mice engrafted with Raji cells in vivo.

Prior studies demonstrated that approximately half of these patients had genomic lesions leading to CRLF2 overexpression, with half of such cases harboring somatic mutations in the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2. To determine whether mutations in other tyrosine kinases might also occur in ALL, we sequenced the tyrosine kinome and downstream signaling genes in 45 high-risk pediatric ALL cases with either a Ph-like gene expression profile or other alterations suggestive of activated kinase signaling.

Rare allelic forms of PRDM9 associated with childhood leukemogenesis.,Genome research,Genome Res.,2012-12-05,"One of the most rapidly evolving genes in humans, PRDM9, is a key determinant of the distribution of meiotic recombination events. Mutations in this meiotic-specific gene have previously been associated with male infertility in humans and recent studies suggest that PRDM9 may be involved in pathological genomic rearrangements. In studying genomes from families with children affected by B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we characterized meiotic recombination patterns within a family with two siblings having hyperdiploid childhood B-ALL and observed unusual localization of maternal recombination events. The mother of the family carries a rare PRDM9 allele, potentially explaining the unusual patterns found. From exomes sequenced in 44 additional parents of children affected with B-ALL, we discovered a substantial and significant excess of rare allelic forms of PRDM9. The rare PRDM9 alleles are transmitted to the affected children in half the cases; nonetheless there remains a significant excess of rare alleles among patients relative to controls. We successfully replicated this latter observation in an independent cohort of 50 children with B-ALL, where we found an excess of rare PRDM9 alleles in aneuploid and infant B-ALL patients. PRDM9 variability in humans is thought to influence genomic instability, and these data support a potential role for PRDM9 variation in risk of acquiring aneuploidies or genomic rearrangements associated with childhood leukemogenesis.",Journal Article,2603.0,26.0,rapidly evolving humans PRDM9 key determinant distribution meiotic recombination events meiotic-specific previously associated male infertility humans recent studies suggest PRDM9 involved pathological genomic rearrangements studying genomes families children affected B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL characterized meiotic recombination patterns family siblings hyperdiploid childhood B-ALL observed unusual localization maternal recombination events mother family carries rare PRDM9 allele potentially explaining unusual patterns exomes sequenced 44 additional parents children affected B-ALL discovered substantial significant excess rare allelic forms PRDM9 rare PRDM9 alleles transmitted affected children half cases nonetheless remains significant excess rare alleles patients relative controls successfully replicated observation independent cohort 50 children B-ALL excess rare PRDM9 alleles aneuploid infant B-ALL patients PRDM9 variability humans thought influence genomic instability support potential role PRDM9 variation risk acquiring aneuploidies genomic rearrangements associated childhood leukemogenesis,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[104, 1, 3, 96, 1755, 3276, 214, 4, 3218, 25488, 16, 8, 825, 4372, 1, 3, 1395, 1, 22661, 4017, 281, 138, 4, 26, 22661, 112, 145, 47, 373, 85, 41, 5, 1045, 5901, 4, 3218, 2, 435, 94, 309, 17, 25488, 68, 40, 646, 4, 1301, 572, 2072, 4, 4559, 5085, 29, 1954, 5, 541, 1424, 20, 132, 31, 2765, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 21, 765, 22661, 4017, 764, 262, 8, 607, 5, 100, 2758, 1041, 8847, 864, 132, 62, 2, 164, 4015, 2145, 1, 6039, 4017, 281, 3, 9733, 1, 3, 607, 4942, 8, 622, 25488, 1254, 751, 8290, 3, 4015, 764, 204, 29, 12233, 4040, 4, 584, 402, 2418, 1, 541, 1424, 5, 132, 62, 21, 2747, 8, 1281, 2, 93, 2612, 1, 622, 3861, 2377, 1, 25488, 3, 622, 25488, 2558, 32, 12959, 6, 3, 1424, 541, 4, 1303, 3, 140, 4648, 125, 469, 8, 93, 2612, 1, 622, 2558, 107, 7, 580, 6, 535, 21, 1878, 6714, 26, 3286, 1664, 4, 35, 306, 180, 1, 212, 541, 5, 132, 62, 1257, 21, 204, 35, 2612, 1, 622, 25488, 2558, 4, 11781, 2, 8027, 132, 62, 7, 25488, 1982, 4, 3218, 16, 2739, 6, 1054, 572, 1753, 2, 46, 74, 538, 8, 174, 200, 9, 25488, 1380, 4, 43, 1, 12720, 47526, 15, 572, 2072, 41, 5, 864, 5661]",1478.0,23222848,Rare allelic forms PRDM9 associated childhood leukemogenesis,8,0.008743169398907104
A case of nonleukemic myeloid sarcoma with FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement: an unusual presentation of a rare disease.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-01-01,"Rearrangement of the PDGFRA gene defines a distinct group of hematopoietic neoplasms that commonly present with persistent eosinophilia and are highly sensitive to low-dose imatinib mesylate treatment. Although rare cases of PDGFRA rearrangement-associated acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia can occur, nonleukemic myeloid sarcoma has not been reported, and its sensitivity to imatinib treatment is unknown. Herein, we report a 31-year-old man with nonleukemic myeloid sarcoma and marked peripheral blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that both bone marrow hematopoietic precursors and blasts of the myeloid sarcoma were positive for FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement. The patient consequently received imatinib treatment at a dosage of 100 mg daily.

We estimated methotrexate plasma clearance for 1279 patients with ALL treated with methotrexate (24-hour infusion of a 1 g/m2 dose or 4-hour infusion of a 2 g/m2 dose) on the Children’s Oncology Group P9904 and P9905 protocols. Methotrexate clearance was lower in older children (P = 7 x 10(-7)), girls (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)), and those who received a delayed-intensification phase (P = .0022). A genome-wide analysis showed that methotrexate clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the organic anion transporter gene SLCO1B1 (P = 2.1 x 10(-11)).

The myth of the second remission of acute leukemia in the adult.,Blood,Blood,2012-12-14,"Although the majority of adult patients with both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia achieve remission with upfront chemotherapy, many patients still suffer relapse. Often, the strategy is proposed of treating patients with relapsed leukemia into a second remission (CR2) and then proceeding to allogeneic transplantation as the definitive curative approach. However, the long-term outcomes of such a strategy are poor: the 5-year overall survival from first relapse for patients with acute leukemia is only approximately 10%. This Perspective highlights the fact that most patients do not achieve CR2 and therefore never really have an opportunity for a potential curative therapy. Although patients who undergo transplantation after relapse may be cured, those who do not achieve CR2 are rarely candidates for transplantation; therefore, the overall outcome for patients who relapse is dismal. There is therefore an urgent need not only for more effective upfront therapy to prevent relapse, but also for the development of therapies that can serve as effective bridging treatments between relapse and transplantation. We suggest that more optimal use of minimal residual disease detection during first remission may also improve the chances for successful transplantation therapy via earlier reinduction therapy, allowing transplantation before overt relapse.",Journal Article,2594.0,112.0,majority adult patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myelogenous leukemia achieve remission upfront chemotherapy patients suffer relapse strategy proposed treating patients relapsed leukemia second remission CR2 proceeding allogeneic transplantation definitive curative approach long-term outcomes strategy poor 5-year overall survival relapse patients acute leukemia approximately 10 Perspective highlights fact patients achieve CR2 opportunity potential curative therapy patients undergo transplantation relapse cured achieve CR2 rarely candidates transplantation overall outcome patients relapse dismal urgent need effective upfront therapy prevent relapse development therapies serve effective bridging treatments relapse transplantation suggest optimal use minimal residual disease detection remission improve chances successful transplantation therapy earlier reinduction therapy allowing transplantation overt relapse,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 3, 686, 1, 780, 7, 5, 110, 286, 1275, 2, 286, 2194, 1359, 734, 5, 2941, 56, 445, 7, 1234, 6506, 429, 629, 3, 692, 16, 1587, 1, 1367, 7, 5, 591, 237, 8, 419, 734, 7865, 2, 818, 13053, 6, 1063, 497, 22, 3, 1057, 1075, 353, 137, 3, 319, 337, 123, 1, 225, 8, 692, 32, 334, 3, 33, 111, 63, 25, 29, 157, 429, 9, 7, 5, 286, 16, 158, 705, 79, 26, 3727, 2527, 3, 1991, 17, 96, 7, 1022, 44, 1359, 7865, 2, 673, 1737, 20765, 47, 35, 2666, 9, 8, 174, 1075, 36, 242, 7, 54, 1251, 497, 50, 429, 68, 40, 3733, 135, 54, 1022, 44, 1359, 7865, 32, 2416, 1931, 9, 497, 673, 3, 63, 228, 9, 7, 54, 429, 16, 3929, 125, 16, 673, 35, 5013, 594, 44, 158, 9, 80, 323, 2941, 36, 6, 1682, 429, 84, 120, 9, 3, 193, 1, 235, 17, 122, 1833, 22, 323, 15636, 640, 59, 429, 2, 497, 21, 309, 17, 80, 665, 119, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 638, 190, 157, 734, 68, 120, 401, 3, 10726, 9, 1401, 497, 36, 847, 1677, 10177, 36, 2952, 497, 348, 7192, 429]",1332.0,23243288,myth second remission acute leukemia adult,33,0.036065573770491806
Historical trends in the use of radiation therapy for pediatric cancers: 1973-2008.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2012-12-27,"This study was undertaken to assess historical trends in the use of radiation therapy (RT) for pediatric cancers over the past 4 decades. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the 9 original tumor registries (SEER-9) was queried to identify patients aged 0 to 19 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, bone and joint cancer, cancer of the brain and nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, Wilms tumor, or retinoblastoma from 1973 to 2008. Patients were grouped into 4-year time epochs. The number and percentage of patients who received RT as part of their initial treatment were calculated per epoch by each diagnosis group from 1973 to 2008. RT use for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and retinoblastoma declined sharply from 57%, 57%, and 30% in 1973 to 1976 to 11%, 15%, and 2%, respectively, in 2005 to 2008. Similarly, smaller declines in RT use were also seen in brain cancer (70%-39%), bone cancer (41%-21%), Wilms tumor (75%-53%), and neuroblastoma (60%-25%). RT use curves for Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma were nonlinear with nadirs in 1993 to 1996 at 39% and 19%, respectively. There were minimal changes in RT use for Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia, roughly stable at 72%, 40%, and 11%, respectively. Almost all patients treated with RT were given external beam RT exclusively. However, from 1985 to 2008, treatments involving brachytherapy, radioisotopes, or combination therapy increased in frequency, comprising 1.8%, 4.6%, and 11.9% of RT treatments in brain cancer, soft tissue cancer, and retinoblastoma, respectively. The use of RT is declining over time in 7 of 10 pediatric cancer categories.

For modeling the complexity of the human disease, primary tumor cells are by far superior to established cell lines. As qualified exemplary model, patients' acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells reliably engraft in mice inducing orthotopic disseminated leukemia closely resembling the disease in men. Unfortunately, disease monitoring of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in mice is hampered by lack of a suitable readout parameter. Patients' acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were lentivirally transduced to express the membrane-bound form of Gaussia luciferase. In vivo imaging was established in individual patients' leukemias and extensively validated. Bioluminescence in vivo imaging enabled reliable and continuous follow-up of individual mice. Light emission strictly correlated to post mortem quantification of leukemic burden and revealed a logarithmic, time and cell number dependent growth pattern. Imaging conveniently quantified frequencies of leukemia initiating cells in limiting dilution transplantation assays. Upon detecting a single leukemia cell within more than 10,000 bone marrow cells, imaging enabled monitoring minimal residual disease, time to tumor re-growth and relapse. Imaging quantified therapy effects precisely and with low variances, discriminating treatment failure from partial and complete responses. For the first time, we characterized in detail how in vivo imaging reforms preclinical studies on patient-derived tumors upon increasing monitoring resolution. In the future, in vivo imaging will enable performing precise preclinical studies on a broad range of highly demanding clinical challenges, such as treatment failure, resistance in leukemia initiating cells, minimal residual disease and relapse.",Journal Article,2577.0,27.0,"Xenograft mouse models represent helpful tools preclinical studies human modeling complexity human disease primary far superior established lines qualified exemplary model patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia reliably engraft mice inducing orthotopic disseminated leukemia closely resembling disease men Unfortunately disease monitoring acute lymphoblastic leukemia mice hampered lack suitable readout parameter Patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia lentivirally transduced express membrane-bound form Gaussia luciferase vivo imaging established individual patients leukemias extensively validated Bioluminescence vivo imaging enabled reliable continuous follow-up individual mice Light emission strictly correlated post mortem quantification leukemic burden revealed logarithmic time number dependent growth pattern Imaging conveniently quantified frequencies leukemia initiating limiting dilution transplantation detecting single leukemia 10,000 bone marrow imaging enabled monitoring minimal residual disease time re-growth relapse Imaging quantified therapy effects precisely low variances discriminating treatment failure partial complete responses time characterized vivo imaging reforms preclinical studies patient-derived increasing monitoring resolution future vivo imaging enable performing precise preclinical studies broad range highly demanding clinical challenges treatment failure resistance leukemia initiating minimal residual disease relapse",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1330, 830, 274, 1231, 3951, 1896, 9, 693, 94, 23, 171, 57, 9, 2057, 3, 3082, 1, 3, 171, 34, 86, 30, 37, 32, 20, 3272, 1123, 6, 635, 31, 285, 22, 9575, 31871, 202, 7, 286, 1275, 37, 4092, 12343, 4, 399, 1958, 2157, 3605, 3210, 8855, 3, 34, 4, 325, 3869, 34, 1315, 1, 286, 1275, 4, 399, 16, 6786, 20, 926, 1, 8, 2884, 18589, 4219, 7, 286, 1275, 37, 11, 62285, 5042, 6, 1669, 3, 1905, 2951, 1297, 1, 39321, 3864, 4, 386, 270, 10, 635, 4, 797, 7, 2792, 2, 3576, 938, 7956, 4, 386, 270, 4387, 2450, 2, 1314, 166, 126, 1, 797, 399, 1691, 1799, 10395, 438, 6, 539, 34229, 4752, 1, 2015, 892, 2, 553, 8, 20397, 98, 2, 31, 207, 470, 129, 1177, 270, 23200, 2790, 2722, 1, 2637, 37, 4, 817, 10446, 497, 1013, 1548, 2502, 8, 226, 31, 262, 80, 76, 79, 984, 581, 37, 270, 4387, 1315, 1048, 753, 34, 98, 6, 30, 1491, 129, 2, 429, 270, 2790, 36, 176, 7428, 2, 5, 154, 24607, 8059, 24, 496, 29, 450, 2, 236, 253, 9, 3, 157, 98, 21, 765, 4, 5000, 832, 4, 386, 270, 29388, 693, 94, 23, 69, 526, 57, 1548, 602, 1315, 2125, 4, 3, 508, 4, 386, 270, 303, 3047, 3620, 3260, 693, 94, 23, 8, 2094, 184, 1, 561, 14562, 38, 1427, 225, 22, 24, 496, 251, 4, 2637, 37, 1048, 753, 34, 2, 429]",1728.0,23300782,vivo imaging enables high resolution preclinical trials patients leukemia growing mice,0,0.0
Feasibility of allografting in patients with advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia after salvage therapy with inotuzumab ozogamicin.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2013-01-10,"No highly effective salvage therapy exists for patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) is a CD22 monoclonal antibody attached to calicheamycin that targets B lymphocytes in early stages of development, successfully inducing remission in patients with multiply relapsed ALL. We describe our findings in 26 patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) after treatment with IO between September 2010 and October 2011. Patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 5-70 years) received an allogeneic matched sibling donor (n = 9), matched- or 1-antigen mismatched unrelated donor (n = 16), or cord blood donor SCT (n = 1) while in complete remission (n = 23) or with active disease (n = 3). At the time of SCT, 15 patients were in complete remission without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) measured by multiparameter flow cytometry. Patients were heavily pretreated, including 5 patients who had received previous allogeneic SCT. Patients received a median of 3 courses of IO (range, 1-5 courses) before SCT. Seven patients are alive at a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 5-16 months), with 1-year event-free and overall survival (OS) of 22% and 20%, respectively. Patients without MRD at time of SCT had a markedly better 1-year OS of 42%. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 6 months and 1 year were 40% and 60%, respectively, with 5 deaths attributed to venoocclusive disease (VOD).

We describe the outcome and delineate prognostic factors and optimal post-remission therapy in 85 consecutive patients (median age 38 years) treated uniformly in the prospective trial UKALLXII/ECOG2993. The immunophenotype of this leukemia was pro-B (CD10(NEG)). Immaturity was further suggested by high expression of the stem-cell antigens, CD133 and CD135, although CD34 expression was significantly lower than in t(4;11)-negative patients. Complete remission was achieved in 77 (93%) patients but only 35% survived 5 years (95% CI: 25-45%); the relapse rate was 45% (95% CI: 33-58%). Thirty-one patients underwent allogeneic transplantation in first remission (15 sibling donors and 16 unrelated donors): with 5-year survival rates of 56% and 67% respectively, only 2/31 patients relapsed. This compares with a 24% survival rate and 59% relapse rate in 46 patients who received post-remission chemotherapy. A major determinant of outcome was age with 71% of patients aged <25 years surviving. Younger patients had lower relapse rates (19%) but most received allografts in first complete remission. In conclusion, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate an advantage of allografting over chemotherapy but only five younger patients received chemotherapy. Prospective trials are required to determine whether poor outcomes in older patients can be improved by reduced-intensity conditioning allografts.

Clin. Oncol.,2013-01-28,"We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of dexamethasone and a novel dosing method of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (EC-Asnase) in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients achieving complete remission (CR) on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 were eligible for random assignment to 1) dexamethasone or prednisone, administered as 5-day pulses, every 3 weeks, and 2) weekly EC-Asnase, administered as a 25,000 IU/m(2) fixed dose (FD) or individualized dose (ID) starting at 12,500-IU/m(2), adjusted every 3 weeks based on nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) determinations. Between 2000 and 2004, 492 evaluable patients (ages 1 to 18 years) enrolled; 473 patients (96%) achieved CR. Four hundred eight patients (86%) participated in the corticosteroid randomization and 384 patients (81%) in the EC-Asnase randomization. With 4.9 years of median follow-up, dexamethasone was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 90% v 81% for prednisone; P = .01) but higher rates of infection (P = .03) and, in older children, higher cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis (P = .02) and fracture (P = .06). ID EC-Asnase had superior 5-year EFS (90% v 82% for FD; P = .04), but did not reduce the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity. Multivariable analysis identified both dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase as independent predictors of favorable EFS. There was no overall difference in skeletal toxicity by corticosteroid type; dexamethasone was associated with more infections and, in older children, increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture. There was no difference in asparaginase-related toxicity by EC-Asnase dosing method. Dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase were each associated with superior EFS.

Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2013-02-03,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.",Journal Article,2543.0,190.0,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia aggressive hematological resulting malignant transformation lymphoid progenitors Despite intensive chemotherapy 20 pediatric patients 50 adult patients achieve complete remission relapse intensified chemotherapy making disease relapse resistance therapy substantial challenge treatment disease whole-exome sequencing identify cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II NT5C2 encodes 5'-nucleotidase enzyme responsible inactivation nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs 20/103 19 relapse ALLs 1/35 3 relapse B-precursor ALLs NT5C2 increased nucleotidase activity vitro conferred resistance chemotherapy 6-mercaptopurine 6-thioguanine expressed lymphoblasts support prominent role activating NT5C2 increased nucleoside-analog metabolism disease progression chemotherapy resistance,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 1275, 62, 16, 35, 571, 2890, 30, 1113, 29, 3, 393, 1392, 1, 2303, 4321, 550, 1686, 56, 179, 1, 815, 7, 2, 252, 212, 1, 780, 7, 5, 62, 1022, 44, 1359, 8, 236, 734, 15, 429, 50, 7311, 56, 1079, 34, 429, 2, 251, 6, 36, 3, 96, 1281, 1745, 4, 3, 24, 1, 26, 34, 75, 902, 2865, 615, 21, 255, 138, 4, 3, 7698, 7344, 35141, 215, 145, 17003, 92, 4322, 8, 7344, 35141, 1644, 17, 16, 2327, 9, 3, 2297, 1, 4032, 3497, 56, 600, 4, 179, 3283, 326, 429, 102, 31, 10706, 2, 14, 465, 27, 429, 132, 2765, 10706, 17003, 620, 652, 514, 101, 35141, 128, 4, 439, 2, 3851, 251, 6, 56, 5, 49, 9223, 2, 49, 17598, 198, 570, 4, 62, 10521, 46, 99, 538, 8, 3689, 200, 9, 1616, 138, 4, 17003, 2, 101, 4032, 3497, 1600, 4, 34, 91, 2, 56, 251, 4, 62]",1059.0,23377281,Activating NT5C2 nucleotidase drive chemotherapy resistance relapsed,0,0.0
Lmo2 induces hematopoietic stem cell-like features in T-cell progenitor cells prior to leukemia.,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",Stem Cells,2013-05-01,"LIM domain only 2 (Lmo2) is frequently deregulated in sporadic and gene therapy-induced acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) where its overexpression is an important initiating mutational event. In transgenic and retroviral mouse models, Lmo2 expression can be enforced in multiple hematopoietic lineages but leukemia only arises from T cells. These data suggest that Lmo2 confers clonal growth advantage in T-cell progenitors. We analyzed proliferation, differentiation, and cell death in CD2-Lmo2 transgenic thymic progenitor cells to understand the cellular effects of enforced Lmo2 expression. Most impressively, Lmo2 transgenic T-cell progenitor cells were blocked in differentiation, quiescent, and immortalized in vitro on OP9-DL1 stromal cells. These cellular effects were concordant with a transcriptional signature in Lmo2 transgenic T-cell progenitor cells that is also present in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early T-cell precursor ALL. These results are significant in light of the crucial role of Lmo2 in the maintenance of the HSC.

Diagnostic and therapeutic advances in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: a focus on hematopoietic cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-02-05,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an exceedingly rare disorder categorized under acute myeloid leukemia by the World Health Organization. Phenotypically, malignant cells coexpress CD4(+) and CD56(+) without coexpressing common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers. BPDCN frequently expresses CD123, TCL1, BDCA-2, and CD2AP. Restriction of CD2AP expression to plasmacytoid dendritic cells makes it a useful tool to help confirm diagnosis. Clonal complex chromosome aberrations are described in two-thirds of cases. Eighty percent of BPDCN cases present with nonspecific dermatological manifestations, prompting inclusion in the differential diagnosis of atypical skin rashes refractory to standard treatment. Prognosis is poor, with a median survival of less than 18 months. No prospective randomized data exist to define the most optimal frontline chemotherapy. Current practice considers acute myeloid leukemia-like or acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like regimens acceptable for induction treatment. Unfortunately, responses are short-lived, with second remissions difficult to achieve, underscoring the need to consider hematopoietic cell transplantation early in the disease course.

Slower processing speed after treatment for pediatric brain tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Psycho-oncology,Psychooncology,2013-02-28,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and brain tumor (BT) survivors are at risk for post-treatment IQ declines. The extent to which lower scores represent global cognitive decline versus domain-specific impairment remains unclear. This study examined discrepancies between processing speed and estimated IQ (EIQ) scores and identified clinical characteristics associated with score discrepancies in a sample of pediatric cancer survivors. Survivors (50 ALL, 50 BT) ages 12-17 years completed cognitive testing. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence provided an untimed measure of general reasoning ability (EIQ). The age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale provided a Processing Speed Index (PSI) score. Scores were examined and compared. Survivors' PSI scores were lower than their EIQ scores (BT t(45) =6.3, p<0.001; ALL t(49) =6.9, p<0.001). For BT survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with history of craniospinal irradiation, t(44) =3.3, p<0.01. For ALL survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with male gender, grade retention, and time since diagnosis, F(3, 46) =10.1, p<0.001. Clinically significant EIQ-PSI score discrepancies were identified in 41.3% of BT and 14.0% of ALL survivors. Many pediatric BT and ALL survivors exhibit slower processing speed than expected for age, whereas general reasoning ability remains largely intact. Risk factors associated with larger EIQ-PSI discrepancies include the following: BT diagnosis, craniospinal irradiation (BT only), male gender, and younger age at diagnosis (ALL only). Grade retention was frequent and associated with lower EIQ scores (both groups) and PSI scores (ALL only).

Prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte counts at the end of remission induction in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-03-01,"Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) during treatment have been associated with outcome in children and adults with hematologic malignancies. However, the impact of ALC relative to that of other prognostic factors on the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated in recent trials is unknown. Outcomes of 399 patients aged ≤18 years with newly diagnosed ALL who were enrolled in the Total Therapy XV study at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital were analyzed according to ALC at the end of remission induction therapy. An ALC ≥500 cells/μL was significantly more prevalent among patients with B-lineage ALL, in those with favorable presenting features, and in those who achieved negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status on day 43 of treatment. Both overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were superior among patients with higher ALC, but only the association with OS was statistically significant in a univariate analysis. In multivariable analyses, ALC was not a significant predictor of outcome after controlling for age, leukocyte count, lineage, risk group, and MRD status at the end of induction (P > .1 for all comparisons). However, among MRD-negative patients, those with low ALC had a 5-year OS rate of 84.2% ± 8.9% versus 97.3% ± 1.0% for patients with higher ALC (P = .036).

Novel susceptibility variants at 10p12.31-12.2 for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in ethnically diverse populations.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2013-03-19,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and the incidence of ALL varies by ethnicity. Although accumulating evidence indicates inherited predisposition to ALL, the genetic basis of ALL susceptibility in diverse ancestry has not been comprehensively examined. We performed a multiethnic genome-wide association study in 1605 children with ALL and 6661 control subjects after adjusting for population structure, with validation in three replication series of 845 case subjects and 4316 control subjects. Association was tested by two-sided logistic regression. A novel ALL susceptibility locus at 10p12.31-12.2 (BMI1-PIP4K2A, rs7088318, P = 1.1 × 10(-11)) was identified in the genome-wide association study, with independent replication in European Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans (P = .001, .009, and .04, respectively). Association was also validated at four known ALL susceptibility loci: ARID5B, IKZF1, CEBPE, and CDKN2A/2B. Associations at ARID5B, IKZF1, and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants were consistent across ethnicity, with multiple independent signals at IKZF1 and BMI1-PIP4K2A loci. The frequency of ARID5B and BMI1-PIP4K2A variants differed by ethnicity, in parallel with ethnic differences in ALL incidence.

CD19-targeted T cells rapidly induce molecular remissions in adults with chemotherapy-refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2013-03-01,"Adults with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have a dismal prognosis. Only those patients able to achieve a second remission with no minimal residual disease (MRD) have a hope for long-term survival in the context of a subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We have treated five relapsed B-ALL subjects with autologous T cells expressing a CD19-specific CD28/CD3ζ second-generation dual-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) termed 19-28z. All patients with persistent morphological disease or MRD(+) disease upon T cell infusion demonstrated rapid tumor eradication and achieved MRD(-) complete remissions as assessed by deep sequencing polymerase chain reaction. Therapy was well tolerated, although significant cytokine elevations, specifically observed in those patients with morphologic evidence of disease at the time of treatment, required lymphotoxic steroid therapy to ameliorate cytokine-mediated toxicities. Indeed, cytokine elevations directly correlated to tumor burden at the time of CAR-modified T cell infusions. Tumor cells from one patient with relapsed disease after CAR-modified T cell therapy, who was ineligible for additional allo-HSCT or T cell therapy, exhibited persistent expression of CD19 and sensitivity to autologous 19-28z T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which suggests potential clinical benefit of additional CAR-modified T cell infusions. These results demonstrate the marked antitumor efficacy of 19-28z CAR-modified T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL and the reliability of this therapy to induce profound molecular remissions, forming a highly effective bridge to potentially curative therapy with subsequent allo-HSCT.",Clinical Trial,2517.0,1042.0,Adults relapsed B acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL dismal prognosis patients able achieve second remission minimal residual disease MRD hope long-term survival context subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation allo-HSCT treated relapsed B-ALL subjects autologous expressing CD19-specific CD28/CD3ζ second-generation dual-signaling chimeric antigen receptor CAR termed 19-28z patients persistent morphological disease MRD disease infusion demonstrated rapid eradication achieved MRD complete remissions assessed deep sequencing polymerase chain reaction Therapy tolerated significant cytokine elevations specifically observed patients morphologic evidence disease time treatment required lymphotoxic steroid therapy ameliorate cytokine-mediated toxicities cytokine elevations directly correlated burden time CAR-modified infusions patient relapsed disease CAR-modified therapy ineligible additional allo-HSCT therapy exhibited persistent expression CD19 sensitivity autologous 19-28z cell-mediated cytotoxicity suggests potential clinical benefit additional CAR-modified infusions demonstrate marked antitumor efficacy 19-28z CAR-modified patients relapsed/refractory B-ALL reliability therapy induce profound molecular remissions forming highly effective bridge potentially curative therapy subsequent allo-HSCT,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[857, 5, 591, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 47, 8, 3929, 356, 158, 135, 7, 1665, 6, 1359, 8, 419, 734, 5, 77, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 47, 8, 3045, 9, 319, 337, 25, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 8, 706, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 2564, 1703, 21, 47, 73, 365, 591, 132, 62, 976, 5, 1028, 102, 37, 1046, 8, 3158, 112, 5603, 27267, 419, 914, 1828, 314, 2897, 448, 153, 1881, 4183, 326, 19130, 62, 7, 5, 1882, 4268, 34, 15, 2029, 34, 1548, 102, 31, 904, 264, 1321, 30, 5173, 2, 513, 2029, 236, 3166, 22, 275, 20, 2369, 615, 1451, 1260, 1329, 36, 10, 149, 421, 242, 93, 1675, 4712, 1225, 164, 4, 135, 7, 5, 2815, 241, 1, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 24, 616, 62599, 3853, 36, 6, 9179, 1675, 517, 385, 4462, 1675, 4712, 1606, 438, 6, 30, 892, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1881, 1230, 102, 31, 3435, 30, 37, 29, 104, 69, 5, 591, 34, 50, 1881, 1230, 102, 31, 36, 54, 10, 3773, 9, 402, 2564, 1703, 15, 102, 31, 36, 1416, 1882, 55, 1, 3158, 2, 485, 6, 1028, 326, 19130, 102, 31, 517, 1408, 92, 844, 174, 38, 247, 1, 402, 1881, 1230, 102, 31, 3435, 46, 99, 608, 3, 2003, 579, 209, 1, 326, 19130, 1881, 1230, 102, 37, 4, 7, 5, 591, 430, 132, 62, 2, 3, 4217, 1, 26, 36, 6, 1290, 4399, 219, 3166, 4525, 8, 561, 323, 7728, 6, 751, 1075, 36, 5, 706, 2564, 1703]",1692.0,23515080,CD19-targeted rapidly induce molecular remissions adults chemotherapy-refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia,14,0.015300546448087432
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults: encouraging developments on the way to higher cure rates.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2013-06-21,"Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not adequate to cure most patients of the disease. Complete remission is achieved in the majority of patients, but responses are often not durable. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is used for patients with high risk features, including those who are positive for minimal residual disease after induction and consolidation therapy. Nevertheless, transplant is a toxic intervention, and does not guarantee long-term disease-free survival. Monoclonal antibodies target surface antigens present on leukemic blasts, with the aim of minimizing off-target toxicity. Rituximab, an antibody directed against CD20, prolongs the survival of younger adults with ALL when added to chemotherapy in the frontline setting. Novel agents, such as the cytotoxin-antibody conjugate inotuzumab, and the bispecific T-cell engaging compound blinatumomab, have exhibited marked antileukemic activity in the relapsed setting. As these agents continue in clinical development, it will be important to eventually incorporate them in the frontline treatment approach.

This population has unique genetic, immunophenotypic, and clinical features, differing from both pediatric and older adult patients, with outcomes somewhere between these two populations. However, it has been suggested that outcomes (event-free and overall survival) for these patients are better when they are treated with pediatric-inspired therapeutic regimens. This has been attributed to increased dose and frequency of non-myelosuppressive therapy, earlier and more frequent central nervous system prophylaxis, and longer maintenance therapy.

Evaluation of memory impairment in aging adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with cranial radiotherapy.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2013-04-12,"Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) is a known risk factor for neurocognitive impairment in survivors of childhood cancer and may increase risk for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in adulthood. We performed a cross-sectional evaluation of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with 18 Gy (n = 127) or 24 Gy (n = 138) CRT. Impairment (age-adjusted score >1 standard deviation below expected mean, two-sided exact binomial test) on the Wechsler Memory Scale IV (WMS-IV) was measured. A subset of survivors (n = 85) completed structural and functional neuroimaging. Survivors who received 24 Gy, but not 18 Gy, CRT had impairment in immediate (impairment rate = 33.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.9% to 42.4%; P < .001) and delayed memory (impairment rate = 30.2%, 95% CI = 22.6% to 38.6%; P < .001). The mean score for long-term narrative memory among survivors who received 24 Gy CRT was equivalent to that for individuals older than 69 years. Impaired immediate memory was associated with smaller right (P = .02) and left (P = .008) temporal lobe volumes, and impaired delayed memory was associated with thinner parietal and frontal cortices. Lower hippocampal volumes and increased functional magnetic resonance imaging activation were observed with memory impairment.

CD19 CAR-targeted T cells induce long-term remission and B Cell Aplasia in an immunocompetent mouse model of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-04-09,"Although many adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are induced into remission, most will relapse, underscoring the dire need for novel therapies for this disease. We developed murine CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and an immunocompetent mouse model of B-ALL that recapitulates the disease at genetic, cellular, and pathologic levels. Mouse T cells transduced with an all-murine CD3ζ/CD28-based CAR that is equivalent to the one being used in our clinical trials, eradicate B-ALL in mice and mediate long-term B cell aplasias. In this model, we find that increasing conditioning chemotherapy increases tumor eradication, B cell aplasia, and CAR-modified T cell persistence. Quantification of recipient B lineage cells allowed us to estimate an in vivo effector to endogenous target ratio for B cell aplasia maintenance. In mice exhibiting a dramatic B cell reduction we identified a small population of progenitor B cells in the bone marrow that may serve as a reservoir for long-term CAR-modified T cell stimulation. Lastly, we determine that infusion of CD8+ CAR-modified T cells alone is sufficient to maintain long-term B cell eradication.

Defective K-Ras oncoproteins overcome impaired effector activation to initiate leukemia in vivo.,Blood,Blood,2013-05-01,"Reversing the aberrant biochemical output of oncogenic Ras proteins is one of the great challenges in cancer therapeutics; however, it is uncertain which Ras effectors are required for tumor initiation and maintenance. To address this question, we expressed oncogenic K-Ras(D12) proteins with ""second site"" amino acid substitutions that impair PI3 kinase/Akt or Raf/MEK/ERK activation in bone marrow cells and transplanted them into recipient mice. In spite of attenuated signaling properties, defective K-Ras oncoproteins initiated aggressive clonal T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Murine T-ALLs expressing second site mutant proteins restored full oncogenic Ras activity through diverse mechanisms, which included acquiring novel somatic third site Kras(D12) mutations and silencing PTEN. T-ALL cell lines lacking PTEN had elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt, a gene expression pattern similar to human early T-cell precursor ALL, and were resistant to the potent and selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Our data, which demonstrate strong selective pressure to overcome the defective activation of PI3 kinase/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK, implicate both Ras effector pathways as drivers of aberrant growth in T-ALL and further suggest that leukemia cells will deploy multiple mechanisms to develop resistance to targeted inhibitors in vivo.",Journal Article,2456.0,20.0,Reversing aberrant biochemical output oncogenic Ras great challenges therapeutics uncertain Ras effectors required initiation maintenance address question expressed oncogenic K-Ras D12 `` second site '' amino acid substitutions impair PI3 kinase/Akt Raf/MEK/ERK activation bone marrow transplanted recipient mice spite attenuated signaling properties defective K-Ras oncoproteins initiated aggressive clonal T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL Murine T-ALLs expressing second site restored oncogenic Ras activity diverse mechanisms included acquiring novel somatic site Kras D12 silencing PTEN T-ALL lines lacking PTEN elevated levels phosphorylated Akt expression pattern similar human early T-cell precursor resistant potent selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901 demonstrate strong selective pressure overcome defective activation PI3 kinase/Akt Raf/MEK/ERK implicate Ras effector pathways drivers aberrant growth T-ALL suggest leukemia deploy multiple mechanisms develop resistance targeted inhibitors vivo,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9953, 3, 1898, 1487, 6911, 1, 1302, 1102, 652, 16, 104, 1, 3, 2797, 1427, 4, 12, 1943, 137, 192, 16, 2717, 92, 1102, 4926, 32, 616, 9, 30, 1118, 2, 1146, 6, 1539, 26, 2840, 21, 570, 1302, 1634, 1102, 47730, 652, 5, 419, 606, 522, 3078, 971, 7646, 17, 6267, 6892, 216, 649, 15, 2212, 1693, 1819, 363, 4, 581, 37, 2, 4600, 1370, 237, 5783, 399, 4, 9018, 1, 2656, 314, 1571, 4552, 1634, 1102, 8241, 1917, 571, 1946, 102, 2542, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 1471, 102, 10706, 1046, 419, 606, 620, 652, 4138, 1647, 1302, 1102, 128, 298, 1867, 483, 92, 159, 12720, 229, 1119, 1282, 606, 723, 47730, 138, 2, 2077, 820, 102, 62, 31, 285, 1941, 820, 42, 804, 148, 1, 2365, 649, 8, 145, 55, 1177, 288, 6, 171, 191, 102, 31, 2765, 62, 2, 11, 436, 6, 3, 1157, 2, 1094, 1693, 230, 17885, 114, 74, 92, 608, 1082, 1094, 3738, 6, 1768, 3, 4552, 363, 1, 6892, 216, 649, 2, 2212, 1693, 1819, 5545, 110, 1102, 2070, 460, 22, 3391, 1, 1898, 129, 4, 102, 62, 2, 195, 309, 17, 37, 303, 39686, 232, 483, 6, 690, 251, 6, 238, 222, 4, 386]",1312.0,23637129,Defective K-Ras oncoproteins overcome impaired effector activation initiate leukemia vivo,0,0.0
Epigenetic inactivation of Notch-Hes pathway in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-04-26,"The Notch pathway can have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles, depending on cell context. For example, Notch signaling promotes T cell differentiation and is leukemogenic in T cells, whereas it inhibits early B cell differentiation and acts as a tumor suppressor in B cell leukemia where it induces growth arrest and apoptosis. The regulatory mechanisms that contribute to these opposing roles are not understood. Aberrant promoter DNA methylation and histone modifications are associated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes and have been implicated in leukemogenesis. Using methylated CpG island amplification (MCA)/DNA promoter microarray, we identified Notch3 and Hes5 as hypermethylated in human B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We investigated the methylation status of other Notch pathway genes by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Notch3, JAG1, Hes2, Hes4 and Hes5 were frequently hypermethylated in B leukemia cell lines and primary B-ALL, in contrast to T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. Aberrant methylation of Notch3 and Hes5 in B-ALL was associated with gene silencing and was accompanied by decrease of H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation and gain of H3K9 trimethylation and H3K27 trimethylation. 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment restored Hes5 expression and decreased promoter hypermethylation in most leukemia cell lines and primary B-ALL samples. Restoration of Hes5 expression by lentiviral transduction resulted in growth arrest and apoptosis in Hes5 negative B-ALL cells but not in Hes5 expressing T-ALL cells.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-04-30,"For patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), treatment options are limited, and the clinical course and prognostic factors affecting outcome have not been well characterized. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 123 adult patients with ALL who relapsed after a first HSCT performed at our center between 1993 and 2011. First-line salvage included second HSCT (n = 19), donor lymphocyte infusion with or without prior chemotherapy (n = 11), radiation therapy (n = 6), cytoreductive chemotherapy (n = 30), mild chemotherapy (n = 27), or palliative care (n = 23), with median postrelapse overall survival (OS) of 10 months, 6.5 months, 3 months, 4 months, 4 months, and 1 month, respectively. Despite a complete remission rate of 38% after first-line salvage in the treated patients, the OS rate remained limited with 1- and 2- year OS rates of 17% (95% confidence interval, 13 to 29) and 10% (95% confidence interval, 6 to 20), respectively. On univariate analysis, adverse factors for OS included active disease at the time of first HSCT and short time to progression from first HSCT (<6 months). There was no difference in the 6-month survival postrelapse in patients with isolated extramedullary relapse (44%) compared with combined extramedullary and bone marrow relapse (29%) or those with isolated bone marrow relapse (34%) (P = .8).

Genetic mediators of neurocognitive outcomes in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-05-06,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at increased risk for neurocognitive problems, with significant interindividual variability in outcome. This study examined genetic polymorphisms associated with variability in neurocognitive outcome. Neurocognitive outcomes were evaluated at the end of therapy in 243 survivors treated on an institutional protocol featuring risk-adapted chemotherapy without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Polymorphisms in genes related to pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents, drug metabolism, oxidative stress, and attention problems in noncancer populations were examined as predictors of outcome, using multiple general linear models and controlling for age at diagnosis, sex, race, and treatment intensity. Compared with national norms, the cohort demonstrated significantly higher rates of problems on direct assessment of sustained attention (P = .01) and on parent ratings of attention problems (P = .02). Children with the A2756G polymorphism in methionine synthase (MS) were more likely to demonstrate deficits in attentiveness (P = .03) and response speed (P = .02), whereas those with various polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase demonstrated increased performance variability (P = .01) and reduced attentiveness (P = .003). Polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase (T1460CA) were associated with increased attention variability (P = .03). Parent-reported attention problems were more common in children with the Cys112Arg polymorphism in apoliopoprotein E4 (P = .01). These results are consistent with our previous report of association between attention problems and MS in an independent cohort of long-term survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy only.

Cytokine release syndrome after blinatumomab treatment related to abnormal macrophage activation and ameliorated with cytokine-directed therapy.,Blood,Blood,2013-05-15,"Blinatumomab is a CD19/CD3-bispecific T-cell receptor-engaging (BiTE) antibody with efficacy in refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Some patients treated with blinatumomab and other T cell-activating therapies develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We hypothesized that patients with more severe toxicity may experience abnormal macrophage activation triggered by the release of cytokines by T-cell receptor-activated cytotoxic T cells engaged by BiTE antibodies and leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We prospectively monitored a patient during blinatumomab treatment and observed that he developed HLH. He became ill 36 hours into the infusion with fever, respiratory failure, and circulatory collapse. He developed hyperferritinemia, cytopenias, hypofibrinogenemia, and a cytokine profile diagnostic for HLH. The HLH continued to progress after discontinuation of blinatumomab; however, he had rapid improvement after IL-6 receptor-directed therapy with tocilizumab. Patients treated with T cell-activating therapies, including blinatumomab, should be monitored for HLH, and cytokine-directed therapy may be considered in cases of life-threatening CRS.

Prognostic relevance of integrated genetic profiling in adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2013-05-17,"Adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic tumor associated with poor outcome. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic relevance of genetic alterations, immunophenotypic markers, and microarray gene expression signatures in a panel of 53 adult T-ALL patients treated in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E2993 clinical trial. An early immature gene expression signature, the absence of bi-allelic TCRG deletion, CD13 surface expression, heterozygous deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17, and mutations in IDH1/IDH2 and DNMT3A genes are associated with poor prognosis in this series. In contrast, expression of CD8 or CD62L, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations, and mutations or deletions in the BCL11B tumor suppressor gene were associated with improved overall survival.

We analyzed data on risk factors and outcomes of 642 children with SMNs occurring after treatment for ALL from 18 collaborative study groups between 1980 and 2007. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 186), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 69), and nonmeningioma brain tumor (n = 116) were the most common types of SMNs and had the poorest outcome (5-year survival rate, 18.1% ± 2.9%, 31.1% ± 6.2%, and 18.3% ± 3.8%, respectively). Five-year survival estimates for AML were 11.2% ± 2.9% for 125 patients diagnosed before 2000 and 34.1% ± 6.3% for 61 patients diagnosed after 2000 (P < .001); 5-year survival estimates for MDS were 17.1% ± 6.4% (n = 36) and 48.2% ± 10.6% (n = 33; P = .005). Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation failed to improve outcome of secondary myeloid malignancies after adjusting for waiting time to transplantation. Five-year survival rates were above 90% for patients with meningioma, Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and parotid gland tumor, and 68.5% ± 6.4% for those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighty-nine percent of patients with brain tumors had received cranial irradiation. Solid tumors were associated with cyclophosphamide exposure, and myeloid malignancy was associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors and starting doses of methotrexate of at least 25 mg/m(2) per week and mercaptopurine of at least 75 mg/m(2) per day. Myeloid malignancies with monosomy 7/5q- were associated with high hyperdiploid ALL karyotypes, whereas 11q23/MLL-rearranged AML or MDS was associated with ALL harboring translocations of t(9;22), t(4;11), t(1;19), and t(12;21) (P = .03).

Connective tissue growth factor regulates adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells and facilitates leukemia bone marrow engraftment.,Blood,Blood,2013-06-05,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a major component of the leukemia bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is highly expressed in MSCs, but its role in the BM stroma is unknown. Therefore, we knocked down (KD) CTGF expression in human BM-derived MSCs by CTGF short hairpin RNA. CTGF KD MSCs exhibited fivefold lower proliferation compared with control MSCs and had markedly fewer S-phase cells. CTGF KD MSCs differentiated into adipocytes at a sixfold higher rate than controls in vitro and in vivo. To study the effect of CTGF on engraftment of leukemia cells into BM, an in vivo model of humanized extramedullary BM (EXM-BM) was developed in NOD/SCID/IL-2rg(null) mice. Transplanted Nalm-6 or Molm-13 human leukemia cells engrafted at a threefold higher rate in adipocyte-rich CTGF KD MSC-derived EXM-BM than in control EXM-BM. Leptin was found to be highly expressed in CTGF KD EXM-BM and in BM samples of patients with acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas it was not expressed in normal controls. Given the established role of the leptin receptor in leukemia cells, the data suggest an important role of CTGF in MSC differentiation into adipocytes and of leptin in homing and progression of leukemia.

We report change in intelligence for 102 adult survivors of childhood ALL (age range, 26.6-54.7 years) during a median interval of 28.5 years. Survivors demonstrated lower Performance intelligence (mean, 95.3; standard deviation, 16.5; P = .005) but not Verbal IQ (mean, 97.4; standard deviation, 15.44; P = .09) at initial testing.

Between-course targeting of methotrexate exposure using pharmacokinetically guided dosage adjustments.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2013-06-13,"It is advantageous to individualize high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) to maintain adequate exposure while minimizing toxicities. Previously, we accomplished this through within-course dose adjustments. In this study, we evaluated a strategy to individualize HDMTX based on clearance of each individual's previous course of HDMTX in 485 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Doses were individualized to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration (Cpss) of 33 or 65 μM (approximately 2.5 or 5 g/m(2)/day) for low- and standard-/high-risk patients, respectively. Individualized doses resulted in 70 and 63 % of courses being within 20 % of the targeted Cpss in the low- and standard-/high-risk arms, respectively, compared to 60 % (p < 0.001) and 61 % (p = 0.43) with conventionally dosed therapy. Only 1.3 % of the individualized courses in the standard-/high-risk arm had a Cpss greater than 50 % above the target compared to 7.3 % (p < 0.001) in conventionally dosed therapy. We observed a low rate (8.5 % of courses) of grade 3-4 toxicities. The odds of gastrointestinal toxicity were related to methotrexate plasma concentrations in both the low (p = 0.021)- and standard-/high-risk groups (p = 0.003).

Preclinical and clinical evaluation of forodesine in pediatric and adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2013-06-15,"The discovery that purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency leads to T-cell lymphopenia was the basis for introducing PNP inhibitors for T-cell leukemias. Forodesine is an orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor with picomolar potency. Because T lymphoblasts and indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics to accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), forodesine demonstrated promising activity in preclinical and clinical settings for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and B-cell CLL (B-CLL). However, the use of forodesine in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is unknown. Leukemic blasts obtained from pediatric patients with de novo B-ALL (n = 10) were incubated with forodesine and deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and the biological end points of apoptosis, intracellular dGTP accumulation, and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis were measured. Additionally, adult patients with B-ALL (n = 2) were intravenously infused with 80 mg/m(2)/d daily for 5 days. After therapy, clinical response, toxicity, laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition, and plasma forodesine, dGuo, and intracellular dGTP levels were analyzed. Our in vitro investigations demonstrated that forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation and induced modest apoptosis in de novo B-ALL lymphoblasts. There was time-dependent accumulation of dGTP and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. During therapy, neither patient achieved a complete response (CR), but there was disease stabilization for several weeks in both patients. There was significant maintained inhibition of PNP enzyme in red blood cells, accumulation of forodesine and dGuo in plasma, and intracellular dGTP accumulation in both patients. Our preclinical and clinical investigations suggest that forodesine has activity in B-ALL. However, it needs to be either infused with dGuo or combined with established chemotherapeutic agents based on mechanistic rationale.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2411.0,8.0,discovery purine nucleoside phosphorylase PNP deficiency leads T-cell lymphopenia basis introducing PNP inhibitors T-cell leukemias Forodesine orally bioavailable PNP inhibitor picomolar potency lymphoblasts indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL B inherently elicit favorable pharmacokinetics accumulate deoxyguanosine triphosphate dGTP forodesine demonstrated promising activity preclinical clinical settings patients T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL B-cell CLL B-CLL use forodesine B-cell B-ALL unknown Leukemic blasts obtained pediatric patients novo B-ALL n 10 incubated forodesine deoxyguanosine dGuo end points apoptosis intracellular dGTP accumulation inhibition RNA DNA synthesis measured Additionally adult patients B-ALL n 2 intravenously infused 80 mg/m 2 /d daily 5 days therapy clinical response toxicity laboratory biomarkers including PNP enzyme inhibition plasma forodesine dGuo intracellular dGTP levels vitro investigations demonstrated forodesine treatment inhibited proliferation induced modest apoptosis novo B-ALL lymphoblasts time-dependent accumulation dGTP inhibition RNA DNA synthesis therapy patient achieved complete response CR disease stabilization weeks patients significant maintained inhibition PNP enzyme red blood accumulation forodesine dGuo plasma intracellular dGTP accumulation patients preclinical clinical investigations suggest forodesine activity B-ALL needs infused dGuo combined established chemotherapeutic agents based mechanistic rationale,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1574, 17, 5006, 4032, 10658, 13133, 2299, 1940, 6, 102, 31, 3655, 10, 3, 877, 9, 11165, 13133, 222, 9, 102, 31, 2792, 10483, 16, 35, 1428, 6582, 13133, 230, 5, 28450, 3593, 408, 102, 10521, 2, 2316, 442, 1193, 552, 132, 37, 11183, 5487, 913, 1159, 6, 7859, 17863, 7345, 16319, 10483, 264, 721, 128, 4, 693, 2, 38, 1947, 9, 7, 5, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 2, 132, 31, 552, 132, 552, 137, 3, 119, 1, 10483, 4, 132, 31, 62, 132, 62, 16, 860, 2015, 2438, 683, 29, 815, 7, 5, 1566, 2018, 132, 62, 78, 79, 11, 8303, 5, 10483, 2, 17863, 17864, 2, 3, 1037, 396, 862, 1, 351, 2087, 16319, 1835, 2, 297, 1, 893, 2, 261, 2525, 11, 644, 1724, 780, 7, 5, 132, 62, 78, 18, 11, 1672, 4524, 5, 493, 81, 188, 18, 427, 391, 9, 33, 162, 50, 36, 38, 51, 155, 1624, 582, 141, 13133, 1644, 297, 2, 554, 10483, 17864, 2, 2087, 16319, 148, 11, 311, 114, 4, 439, 2492, 264, 17, 10483, 24, 879, 457, 2, 277, 1721, 351, 4, 1566, 2018, 132, 62, 10521, 125, 10, 98, 470, 1835, 1, 16319, 2, 297, 1, 893, 2, 261, 2525, 190, 36, 2174, 69, 513, 8, 236, 51, 684, 84, 125, 10, 34, 3184, 9, 392, 244, 4, 110, 7, 125, 10, 93, 1955, 297, 1, 13133, 1644, 4, 3422, 315, 37, 1835, 1, 10483, 2, 17864, 4, 554, 2, 2087, 16319, 1835, 4, 110, 7, 114, 693, 2, 38, 2492, 309, 17, 10483, 71, 128, 4, 132, 62, 137, 192, 1891, 6, 40, 361, 4524, 5, 17864, 15, 397, 5, 635, 1573, 183, 90, 23, 2716, 1728]",1902.0,23773454,Preclinical clinical evaluation forodesine pediatric adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,230,0.25136612021857924
Dexamethasone exposure and memory function in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A report from the SJLIFE cohort.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-06-18,"Dexamethasone is used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, though long-term impact on central nervous system (CNS) function is unclear. As glucocorticoids influence hippocampal function, we investigated memory networks in survivors of childhood ALL treated with dexamethasone or prednisone. Neurocognitive assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted in 38 adult survivors randomly recruited from cohorts treated on one of two standard treatment protocols, which differed primarily in the glucocorticoid administered during continuation therapy (dexamethasone [n = 18] vs. prednisone [n = 20]). Groups did not differ in age at diagnosis, age at evaluation, or cumulative intravenous or intrathecal methotrexate exposure. Survivors treated with dexamethasone demonstrated lower performance on multiple memory-dependent measures, including story memory (P = 0.01) and word recognition (P = 0.04), compared to survivors treated with only prednisone.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-18,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can achieve durable remissions in a number of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Little is known about the safety of HSCT in patients age 70 or older. Consecutive patients (n = 54) age 70 or older underwent HSCT between 2007 and 2012. Diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 25), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 4), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1). Median follow-up for survivors was 21 months. All patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, primarily busulfan/fludarabine. All patients received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts: 44 from 8/8 matched unrelated donors, 8 from matched related donors, and 2 from 7/8 matched unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor-based in all patients. The median age at transplantation was 71 years (range, 70 to 76); the median HCT comorbidity index score was 1 (range, 0 to 5). Two patients died before hematopoietic recovery (1 with graft failure and 1 with disease progression), and 1 patient relapsed before hematopoietic recovery; otherwise, all engrafted with median donor chimerism of 94% at 1 month. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 13% and of grades III to IV acute GVHD, 9.3%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 36%, progression-free survival was 39%, overall survival was 39%, and relapse was 56%. Nonrelapse mortality was 3.7% at day +100 and 5.6% at 2 years.

Unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is underused as a curative therapy in eligible patients from the United States.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-25,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a curative therapy for hematologic disorders including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. To determine the utilization of alloHCT from unrelated donors (URDs) in the United States, we calculated the number of patients diagnosed with hematologic disorders age 20 to 74 years based on 2004 to 2008 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results and 2007 US Census data, estimated the percentage of patients who would be eligible for URD alloHCT after discounting the mortality rate during induction therapy and the rate of severe comorbidities, and compared these with the actual 2007 alloHCTs facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. We found that the number of URD alloHCT as a percentage of the estimated potential transplantations ranged from 11% for multiple myeloma to 54% for chronic myeloid leukemia, with an average percentage of 26% for all the disorders considered. In an analysis stratified by age groups (20 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 to 74 years), the utilization of URD alloHCT was higher in younger patients than in older patients for all disorders. Of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patients, approximately 66% underwent URD alloHCT later in the course of their disease (in second or greater complete remission). URD alloHCT is likely underused for potentially curable hematologic disorders, particularly in older patients. Understanding the reasons for low use of alloHCT may lead to strategies to expand the use of this curative therapy for more patients with hematologic disorders.

We compared neuropsychological outcomes for patients treated on DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01, which included a randomized comparison of the two steroid preparations during post-induction therapy in children and adolescents with ALL. Between 2000 and 2005, 408 children with standard-risk or high-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 00-01 were randomly assigned to prednisone or dexamethasone administered as 5-day pulses every 3 weeks for 2 years, beginning at week 7 of treatment. Blinded neuropsychological testing was completed for 170 randomized patients (prednisone, N = 76; dexamethasone, N = 94), all of whom were in continuous complete remission after completion of therapy. Outcomes were comparable for most variables, although patients on the dexamethasone arm performed more poorly on a measure of fluid reasoning (P = 0.02). They also tended to be more likely to be enrolled in special education (dexamethasone, 33% vs. prednisone, 20%, P = 0.09). Dexamethasone has well documented benefit in treatment of ALL.

One hundred fifteen (94%) achieved complete remission (CR) including 101 patients who achieved it with only 1 induction course and had at least 1 minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment; 25 patients underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in first CR and were excluded, leaving 76 patients as the subject of this report. MRD monitoring by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at the end of induction and at ~3-month intervals thereafter. Median age was 54 years (range, 21-84 years). There was no difference in survival by achievement of at least a major molecular response (MMR; BCR-ABL/ABL < 0.1%) at CR (P = .22).

Impact of hemochromatosis gene mutations on cardiac status in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood high-risk leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2013-07-16,"Doxorubicin is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, possibly through the formation of doxorubicin-iron complexes leading to free-radical injury. The authors determined the frequency of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis and their relationship with doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Peripheral blood was tested for 2 common HFE allelic variants: C282Y and H63D. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are biomarkers of cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively, were assayed during therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed with echocardiography. A total of 184 patients had DNA results for at least 1 variant, and 167 had DNA results for both: 24% carried H63D and 10% carried C282Y. Heterozygous C282Y genotype was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations (P = .039), but not NT-proBNP. At a median of 2.2 years (range, 1.0 years-3.6 years) after diagnosis, the mean Z-scores for LV fractional shortening (-0.71 [standard error (SE), 0.25]; P = .008), mass (-0.84 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001), and end-systolic (-4.36 [SE, 0.26], P < .001) and end-diastolic (-0.68 [SE, 0.25]; P = .01) posterior wall thickness were found to be abnormal in children with either allele (n = 32). Noncarriers (n = 63) also were found to have below-normal LV mass (-0.45 [SE, 0.15]; P = .006) and end-systolic posterior wall thickness (-4.06 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001). Later follow-up demonstrated similar results. Doxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with C282Y HFE carriers. Although LV mass and wall thickness were found to be abnormally low overall, they were even lower in HFE carriers, who also had reduced LV function.

Glycovariant anti-CD37 monospecific protein therapeutic exhibits enhanced effector cell-mediated cytotoxicity against chronic and acute B cell malignancies.,mAbs,MAbs,2013-06-07,"TRU-016 is a SMIP(TM) (monospecific protein therapeutic) molecule against the tetraspanin transmembrane family protein CD37 that is currently in Phase 2 trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). In an attempt to enhance the ADCC function of SMIP-016, the chimeric version of TRU-016, SMIP-016(GV) was engineered with a modification in a glycosylation site in the Fc domain. The wild-type and glycovariant SMIP proteins mediate comparable Type I antibody-like direct cytotoxicity in the presence of anti-human Fc crosslinker and show a similar tyrosine phosphorylation pattern post-treatment. However, NK cells stimulated with the SMIP-016(GV) exhibit enhanced activation and release 3-fold more interferon-γ compared with SMIP-016. SMIP-016(GV) shows enhanced ADCC function against cells expressing CD37 with NK cell effectors derived from both normal and CLL-affected individuals. Enhanced ADCC is observed against CLL cells and is sustained at concentrations of SMIP-016(GV) as low at 5E(-6) µg/mL on cells expressing minimal CD37 antigen. In support of the biological relevance of this, SMIP-016(GV) mediates effective ADCC against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with low surface expression of CD37. Collectively, these data suggest potential use of the novel therapeutic agent SMIP-016(GV) with enhanced effector function for B cell malignancies, including CLL and ALL therapy.

Bim polymorphisms: influence on function and response to treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-08-01,"Corticosteroids induce apoptosis in the malignant lymphoid cells and are critical component of combination therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several genome-wide microarray studies showed major implication of proapoptotic Bim in mediating corticosteroid-related resistance in leukemia cells. We investigated Bim gene polymorphisms and their association with childhood ALL outcome, and the mechanism underlying the observed finding. Lower overall survival (OS) was associated with Bim C29201T located in Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain (P = 0.01). An association remained significant in multivariate model (P = 0.007), was more apparent in high-risk patients (P = 0.004) and patients treated with dexamethasone (P = 0.009), and was subsequently confirmed in the replication patient cohort (P = 0.03). RNA analysis revealed that C29201T affects generation of γ isoforms (γ1) that lack proapoptotic BH3 domain.

Integrated genetic and epigenetic analysis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2013-06-10,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the commonest childhood malignancy and is characterized by recurring structural genetic alterations. Previous studies of DNA methylation suggest epigenetic alterations may also be important, but an integrated genome-wide analysis of genetic and epigenetic alterations in ALL has not been performed. We analyzed 137 B-lineage and 30 T-lineage childhood ALL cases using microarray analysis of DNA copy number alterations and gene expression, and genome-wide cytosine methylation profiling using the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) assay. We found that the different genetic subtypes of ALL are characterized by distinct DNA methylation signatures that exhibit significant correlation with gene expression profiles. We also identified an epigenetic signature common to all cases, with correlation to gene expression in 65% of these genes, suggesting that a core set of epigenetically deregulated genes is central to the initiation or maintenance of lymphoid transformation. Finally, we identified aberrant methylation in multiple genes also targeted by recurring DNA copy number alterations in ALL, suggesting that these genes are inactivated far more frequently than suggested by structural genomic analyses alone. Together, these results demonstrate subtype- and disease-specific alterations in cytosine methylation in ALL that influence transcriptional activity, and are likely to exert a key role in leukemogenesis.

Leukemic cells from all affected individuals in both families exhibited 9p deletion, with loss of heterozygosity and retention of the mutant PAX5 allele at 9p13. Two additional sporadic ALL cases with 9p loss harbored somatic PAX5 substitutions affecting Gly183.

Impact of promoter polymorphisms in key regulators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway on the outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-09-13,"The introduction of multiagent treatment protocols has led to a remarkable increase in survival rates for children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, yet for a subpopulation of patients, resistance to chemotherapeutics remains an obstacle to successful treatment. Here we investigate the role of the mitochondrial (or intrinsic) apoptosis pathway in modulating the onset and outcomes of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cell death is a highly regulated process that plays an essential role in regulating cell homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high intrinsic proliferating capacity such as the hematopoietic system. Following the underlying paradigm that cis-acting genetic variation can influence disease risk and outcomes by modulating gene expression, we performed a systematic analysis of the proximal promoter regions of 21 genes involved in apoptosis. Using gene reporter assays, we show that promoter variations in 11 intrinsic apoptosis genes, including ADPRT, APAF1, BCL2, BAD, BID, MCL1, BIRC4, BCL2L1, ENDOG, YWHAB, and YWHAQ, influence promoter activity in an allele-specific manner. We also show that correlated promoter variation and increased expression of MCL1 is associated with reduced overall survival among high-risk patients receiving higher doses of corticosteroid, suggesting that increased expression of this anti-apoptosis gene could lead to reduced cell death and influence treatment response in a disease- and dose-responsive manner.

Current treatment and outcome for childhood acute leukemia in Tanzania.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-08-26,"In order to understand the disparity in childhood leukemia survival in low-income countries (LICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs), we evaluated the resources available at Tanzania's national pediatric oncology ward, and clinical characteristics, disease course and outcomes of children diagnosed with acute leukemia from 2008 through 2010. A chart review and assessment of services was performed to assess childhood leukemia diagnoses, treatment, and outcomes in Tanzania at the Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. Results were compared to those from a 2005 evaluation that showed only one of 20 children with leukemia surviving at 1 year. During the study period, 106 patients presented with leukemia, including 81 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 25 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Forty-nine of 58 (84%) patients with ALL, and six of 17 (35%) with AML who received therapy and had complete data, achieved complete remission. Estimated 2-year event-free survival for all patients with ALL was 33%; for AML it was 0%. Ten patients died prior to initiation of therapy, 19 died of toxicity, and eight abandoned therapy. Though leukemia survival in Tanzania remains far below that in HICs, survival rates for ALL have significantly improved in recent years due to standardization of treatment regimens and better staff, though AML outcome remains dismal.

Unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first and second complete remission: a comparison with allografts from adult unrelated donors.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-09-20,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has an established role in the treatment of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose survival when recipients of grafts from adult unrelated donors approaches that of recipients of grafts from sibling donors. Our aim was to determine the role of mismatched unrelated cord blood grafts in transplantation for 802 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission. Using Cox regression we compared outcomes after 116 mismatched single or double cord blood transplants, 546 peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants and 140 bone marrow transplants. The characteristics of the recipients and their diseases were similar except cord blood recipients were younger, more likely to be non-Caucasians and more likely to have a low white blood cell count at diagnosis. There were differences in donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen-match depending on the source of the graft. Most adult donor transplants were matched at the allele-level considering human leukocyte antigens-A, -B, -C and -DRB1. In contrast, most cord blood transplants were mismatched and considered antigen-level matching; 57% were mismatched at two loci and 29% at one locus whereas only 29% of adult donor transplants were mismatched at one locus and none at two loci. There were no differences in the 3-year probabilities of survival between recipients of cord blood (44%), matched adult donor (44%) and mismatched adult donor (43%) transplants. Cord blood transplants engrafted slower and were associated with less grade 2-4 acute but similar chronic graft-versus-host disease, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. The survival of cord blood graft recipients was similar to that of recipients of matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor grafts and so cord blood should be considered a valid alternative source of stem cells for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the absence of a matched unrelated adult donor.

Global chromatin profiling reveals NSD2 mutations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2013-09-29,"Epigenetic dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancers. We developed a high-information-content mass spectrometry approach to profile global histone modifications in human cancers. When applied to 115 lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, this approach identified distinct molecular chromatin signatures. One signature was characterized by increased histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation, exhibited by several lines harboring translocations in NSD2, which encodes a methyltransferase. A previously unknown NSD2 p.Glu1099Lys (p.E1099K) variant was identified in nontranslocated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines sharing this signature. Ectopic expression of the variant induced a chromatin signature characteristic of NSD2 hyperactivation and promoted transformation. NSD2 knockdown selectively inhibited the proliferation of NSD2-mutant lines and impaired the in vivo growth of an NSD2-mutant ALL xenograft. Sequencing analysis of >1,000 pediatric cancer genomes identified the NSD2 p.E1099K alteration in 14% of t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1-containing ALLs.

Autologous transplantation for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieves outcomes similar to allogeneic transplantation: results of CALGB Study 10001 (Alliance).,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-09-27,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the standard approach to Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We hypothesized that imatinib plus sequential chemotherapy will result in significant leukemia cell cytoreduction in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, allowing collection of normal hematopoietic stem cells uncontaminated by residual BCR/ABL1(+) lymphoblasts and thus reduce the likelihood of relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation for patients under 60 years of age without sibling donors. We enrolled 58 patients; 19 underwent autologous and 15 underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation on study. Imatinib plus sequential chemotherapy resulted in reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-negative stem cells in 9 patients and remained minimally positive in 4 (6 were not evaluable).

Efficacy of glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase g2) in patients with acute kidney injury after high-dose methotrexate therapy.,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,2013-10-17,"Because the incidence rate of renal impairment is 2-10% for patients treated with high-dose methotrexate and renal impairment develops in 0-12.4% of patients treated for osteosarcoma, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of glucarpidase, a recently approved drug that rapidly hydrolyzes methotrexate to inactive metabolites, which allows for nonrenal clearance in patients with delayed renal methotrexate elimination. Pooled analysis of efficacy data from four multicenter single-arm compassionate-use clinical trials using protocols from 1993 to 2007. Of 476 patients with renal toxicity and delayed methotrexate elimination who were treated with intravenous glucarpidase for rescue after high-dose methotrexate, 169 patients had at least one preglucarpidase (baseline) plasma methotrexate concentration greater than 1 μmol/L and one postglucarpidase methotrexate concentration measurement by high-performance liquid chromatography and were included in the efficacy analysis; renal recovery was assessed in 436 patients who had at least one recorded preglucarpidase and postglucarpidase serum creatinine concentration measurement. Efficacy was defined as rapid and sustained clinically important reduction (RSCIR) in plasma methotrexate concentration, with a concentration of 1 μmol/L or lower at all postglucarpidase determinations. Median age of efficacy-evaluable patients was 20 years (range 5 weeks-84 years). Osteosarcoma (36%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20%) were the most frequent underlying diagnoses. Median preglucarpidase serum methotrexate was 11.7 μmol/L. At the first (median 15 minutes) through the last (median 40 hours) postglucarpidase measurement, plasma methotrexate concentrations demonstrated consistent 99% median reduction. RSCIR was achieved by 83 (59%) of 140 patients. A total of 64% of patients with renal impairment greater than or equal to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 recovered to grade 0 or 1 at a median of 12.5 days after glucarpidase administration.

However, the role of inherited genetic variation in Ph-like ALL pathogenesis remains unknown. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 511 ALL cases and 6,661 non-ALL controls, we identified a susceptibility locus for Ph-like ALL (GATA3, rs3824662; P = 2.17 × 10(-14), odds ratio (OR) = 3.85 for Ph-like ALL versus non-ALL; P = 1.05 × 10(-8), OR = 3.25 for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL), with independent validation. The rs3824662 risk allele was associated with somatic lesions underlying Ph-like ALL (CRLF2 rearrangement, JAK gene mutation and IKZF1 deletion) and with variation in GATA3 expression. Finally, genotype at the GATA3 SNP was also associated with early treatment response and risk of ALL relapse.

Targeting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia preclinical models: anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody attenuates leukemia growth.,Annals of hematology,Ann. Hematol.,2013-10-24,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is involved in extracellular matrix production, tumor cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that CTGF expression is elevated in precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and that increased expression of CTGF is associated with inferior outcome in B-ALL. In this study, we characterized the functional role and downstream signaling pathways of CTGF in ALL cells. First, we utilized lentiviral shRNA to knockdown CTGF in RS4;11 and REH ALL cells expressing high levels of CTGF mRNA. Silencing of CTGF resulted in significant suppression of leukemia cell growth compared to control vector, which was associated with AKT/mTOR inactivation and increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. CTGF knockdown sensitized ALL cells to vincristine and methotrexate. Treatment with an anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody, FG-3019, significantly prolonged survival of mice injected with primary xenograft B-ALL cells when co-treated with conventional chemotherapy (vincristine, L-asparaginase and dexamethasone). Data suggest that CTGF represents a targetable molecular aberration in B-ALL, and blocking CTGF signaling in conjunction with administration of chemotherapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for ALL patients.

Neurocognitive outcomes decades after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the St Jude lifetime cohort study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-11-04,"To determine rates, patterns, and predictors of neurocognitive impairment in adults decades after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Survivors of childhood ALL treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who were still alive at 10 or more years after diagnosis and were age ≥ 18 years were recruited for neurocognitive testing. In all, 1,014 survivors were eligible, 738 (72.8%) agreed to participate, and 567 (76.8%) of these were evaluated. Mean age was 33 years; mean time since diagnosis was 26 years. Medical record abstraction was performed for data on doses of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and cumulative chemotherapy. Multivariable modeling was conducted and glmulti package was used to select the best model with minimum Akaike information criterion. Impairment rates across neurocognitive domains ranged from 28.6% to 58.9%, and those treated with chemotherapy only demonstrated increased impairment in all domains (all P values < .006). In survivors who received no CRT, dexamethasone was associated with impaired attention (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.03) and executive function (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.91). The impact of CRT was dependent on young age at diagnosis for intelligence, academic, and memory functions. Risk for executive function problems increased with survival time in a CRT dose-dependent fashion.

Targeted radiosensitization of ETS fusion-positive prostate cancer through PARP1 inhibition.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2013-10-01,"ETS gene fusions, which result in overexpression of an ETS transcription factor, are considered driving mutations in approximately half of all prostate cancers. Dysregulation of ETS transcription factors is also known to exist in Ewing's sarcoma, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We previously discovered that ERG, the predominant ETS family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in human prostate cancer specimens. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ERG-PARP1 interaction may confer radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this radio-resistance could be reversed through PARP1 inhibition. Using lentiviral approaches, we established isogenic models of ERG overexpression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, ERG overexpression increased clonogenic survival following radiation by 1.25 (±0.07) fold (mean ± SEM) and also resulted in increased PARP1 activity. PARP1 inhibition with olaparib preferentially radiosensitized ERG-positive cells by a factor of 1.52 (±0.03) relative to ERG-negative cells (P < .05). Neutral and alkaline COMET assays and immunofluorescence microscopy assessing γ-H2AX foci showed increased short- and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was preferentially reversed by PARP1 inhibition. These findings were verified in an in vivo xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that ERG overexpression confers radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through inhibition of PARP1. These results motivate the use of PARP1 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with localized ETS fusion-positive cancers.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome: a retrospective analysis from the Ponte di Legno study group.,Blood,Blood,2013-11-12,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased risk of B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The prognostic factors and outcome of DS-ALL patients treated in contemporary protocols are uncertain. We studied 653 DS-ALL patients enrolled in 16 international trials from 1995 to 2004. Non-DS BCP-ALL patients from the Dutch Child Oncology Group and Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster were reference cohorts. DS-ALL patients had a higher 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse (26% ± 2% vs 15% ± 1%, P < .001) and 2-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) (7% ± 1% vs 2.0% ± <1%, P < .0001) than non-DS patients, resulting in lower 8-year event-free survival (EFS) (64% ± 2% vs 81% ± 2%, P < .0001) and overall survival (74% ± 2% vs 89% ± 1%, P < .0001). Independent favorable prognostic factors include age <6 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58, P = .002), white blood cell (WBC) count <10 × 10(9)/L (HR = 0.60, P = .005), and ETV6-RUNX1 (HR = 0.14, P = .006) for EFS and age (HR = 0.48, P < .001), ETV6-RUNX1 (HR = 0.1, P = .016) and high hyperdiploidy (HeH) (HR = 0.29, P = .04) for relapse-free survival. TRM was the major cause of death in ETV6-RUNX1 and HeH DS-ALLs. Thus, while relapse is the main contributor to poorer survival in DS-ALL, infection-associated TRM was increased in all protocol elements, unrelated to treatment phase or regimen. Future strategies to improve outcome in DS-ALL should include improved supportive care throughout therapy and reduction of therapy in newly identified good-prognosis subgroups.

UKALLXII/ECOG2993: addition of imatinib to a standard treatment regimen enhances long-term outcomes in Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2013-11-25,"The Philadelphia chromosome positive arm of the UKALLXII/ECOG2993 study for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) enrolled 266 patients between 1993 and 2003 (pre-imatinib cohort). In 2003 imatinib was introduced as a single-agent course following induction (N = 86, late imatinib). In 2005 imatinib was added to the second phase of induction (N = 89, early imatinib). The complete remission (CR) rate was 92% in the imatinib cohort vs 82% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .004). At 4 years, the overall survival (OS) of all patients in the imatinib cohort was 38% vs 22% in the preimatinib cohort (P = .003). The magnitude of the difference between the preimatinib and imatinib cohorts in event-free survival (EFS), OS, and relapse-free survival (RFS) seen in univariate analysis was even greater in the multivariate analysis. In the preimatinib cohort, 31% of those starting treatment achieved hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) compared with 46% in the imatinib cohort. A Cox multivariate analysis taking alloHSCT into account showed a modest additional benefit to imatinib (hazard ratio for EFS = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.93, P = .02), but no significant benefit for OS and RFS. Adding imatinib to standard therapy improves CR rate and long-term OS for adults with ALL. A proportion of the OS benefit derives from the fact that imatinib facilitates alloHSCT.

Mechanistically, AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR3C1 at position S134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo.",Journal Article,2246.0,116.0,Glucocorticoid resistance major driver therapeutic failure acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL identify AKT1 kinase major negative regulator NR3C1 glucocorticoid receptor activity driving glucocorticoid resistance T-ALL Mechanistically AKT1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced expression direct phosphorylation NR3C1 position S134 blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation nucleus demonstrate loss PTEN consequent AKT1 activation effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis induce resistance glucocorticoid therapy Conversely pharmacologic inhibition AKT MK2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR3C1 translocation nucleus increases response T-ALL glucocorticoid therapy effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance vitro vivo,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5399, 251, 16, 8, 458, 2228, 1, 189, 496, 4, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 467, 21, 255, 3, 4958, 216, 22, 8, 458, 199, 2452, 1, 3, 29479, 5399, 153, 178, 128, 4057, 5399, 251, 4, 102, 62, 4187, 4958, 8312, 5399, 277, 145, 55, 20, 1196, 982, 1, 29479, 28, 3559, 63673, 2, 2521, 5399, 277, 29479, 2006, 6, 3, 4262, 1393, 21, 608, 17, 407, 1, 820, 2, 8436, 4958, 363, 122, 1856, 2381, 5399, 277, 351, 2, 1290, 251, 6, 5399, 36, 3154, 2788, 297, 1, 649, 5, 13434, 1856, 8489, 5399, 277, 29479, 2006, 6, 3, 4262, 1106, 3, 51, 1, 102, 62, 37, 6, 5399, 36, 2, 1856, 10984, 5399, 251, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386]",899.0,24291004,Direct reversal glucocorticoid resistance AKT inhibition acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0

We demonstrated rapid induction of deep molecular remissions in adults, which has been recently confirmed in a case report involving a child with B-ALL.

c-Myc inhibition prevents leukemia initiation in mice and impairs the growth of relapsed and induction failure pediatric T-ALL cells.,Blood,Blood,2014-01-06,"Although prognosis has improved for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), 20% to 30% of patients undergo induction failure (IF) or relapse. Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are hypothesized to be resistant to chemotherapy and to mediate relapse. We and others have shown that Notch1 directly regulates c-Myc, a known regulator of quiescence in stem and progenitor populations, leading us to examine whether c-Myc inhibition results in efficient targeting of T-ALL-initiating cells. We demonstrate that c-Myc suppression by small hairpin RNA or pharmacologic approaches prevents leukemia initiation in mice by eliminating LIC activity.

RAG-mediated recombination is the predominant driver of oncogenic rearrangement in ETV6-RUNX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2014-01-12,"The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene, found in 25% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, is acquired in utero but requires additional somatic mutations for overt leukemia. We used exome and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing to characterize secondary events associated with leukemic transformation. RAG-mediated deletions emerge as the dominant mutational process, characterized by recombination signal sequence motifs near breakpoints, incorporation of non-templated sequence at junctions, ∼30-fold enrichment at promoters and enhancers of genes actively transcribed in B cell development and an unexpectedly high ratio of recurrent to non-recurrent structural variants. Single-cell tracking shows that this mechanism is active throughout leukemic evolution, with evidence of localized clustering and reiterated deletions. Integration of data on point mutations and rearrangements identifies ATF7IP and MGA as two new tumor-suppressor genes in ALL. Thus, a remarkably parsimonious mutational process transforms ETV6-RUNX1-positive lymphoblasts, targeting the promoters, enhancers and first exons of genes that normally regulate B cell differentiation.

Targeting STAT5 in hematologic malignancies through inhibition of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain protein BRD2.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2014-01-16,"The transcription factor signal STAT5 is constitutively activated in a wide range of leukemias and lymphomas, and drives the expression of genes necessary for proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. Thus, targeting STAT5 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for hematologic malignancies. Given the importance of bromodomain-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation, we considered the hypothesis that a pharmacologic bromodomain inhibitor could inhibit STAT5-dependent gene expression. We found that the small-molecule bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 decreases STAT5-dependent (but not STAT3-dependent) transcription of both heterologous reporter genes and endogenous STAT5 target genes. JQ1 reduces STAT5 function in leukemia and lymphoma cells with constitutive STAT5 activation, or inducibly activated by cytokine stimulation. Among the BET bromodomain subfamily of proteins, it seems that BRD2 is the critical mediator for STAT5 activity. In experimental models of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias, where activated STAT5 contributes to leukemia cell survival, Brd2 knockdown or JQ1 treatment shows strong synergy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated form umbilical cord blood, which is enriched in normal hematopoietic precursor cells, were unaffected by these combinations. These findings indicate a unique functional association between BRD2 and STAT5, and suggest that combinations of JQ1 and TKIs may be an important rational strategy for treating leukemias and lymphomas driven by constitutive STAT5 activation.",Journal Article,2196.0,38.0,transcription factor signal STAT5 constitutively activated wide range leukemias lymphomas drives expression necessary proliferation survival self-renewal targeting STAT5 appealing therapeutic strategy hematologic malignancies Given importance bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulation considered hypothesis pharmacologic bromodomain inhibitor inhibit STAT5-dependent expression small-molecule bromodomain extra-terminal BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 decreases STAT5-dependent STAT3-dependent transcription heterologous reporter endogenous STAT5 target JQ1 reduces STAT5 function leukemia lymphoma constitutive STAT5 activation inducibly activated cytokine stimulation BET bromodomain subfamily BRD2 critical mediator STAT5 activity experimental models acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias activated STAT5 contributes leukemia survival Brd2 knockdown JQ1 treatment shows strong synergy tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKI inducing apoptosis leukemia contrast mononuclear isolated form umbilical cord blood enriched normal hematopoietic precursor unaffected combinations findings indicate unique functional association BRD2 STAT5 suggest combinations JQ1 TKIs important rational strategy treating leukemias lymphomas driven constitutive STAT5 activation,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 866, 161, 1235, 5517, 16, 2818, 735, 4, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 2792, 2, 1557, 2, 5267, 3, 55, 1, 214, 1493, 9, 457, 25, 2, 1074, 4495, 631, 529, 5517, 16, 35, 9458, 189, 692, 9, 813, 441, 447, 3, 1187, 1, 7904, 1101, 652, 4, 1431, 863, 21, 515, 3, 1492, 17, 8, 2788, 7904, 230, 359, 1433, 5517, 470, 145, 55, 21, 204, 17, 3, 302, 1354, 7904, 2, 3420, 2158, 4661, 7904, 230, 10635, 2140, 5517, 470, 84, 44, 1439, 470, 866, 1, 110, 15488, 3674, 214, 2, 2682, 5517, 283, 214, 10635, 2389, 5517, 343, 4, 2, 37, 5, 3178, 5517, 363, 15, 26188, 735, 20, 1675, 2503, 107, 3, 4661, 7904, 13989, 1, 652, 192, 2744, 17, 22827, 16, 3, 740, 3810, 9, 5517, 128, 4, 1560, 274, 1, 286, 102, 31, 1275, 2792, 1257, 735, 5517, 2444, 6, 31, 25, 22827, 1563, 15, 10635, 24, 1949, 1082, 3439, 5, 564, 216, 222, 1379, 4, 1958, 351, 4, 37, 4, 748, 3041, 37, 1355, 1297, 5998, 1885, 315, 92, 16, 2220, 4, 295, 1007, 2765, 37, 11, 4585, 20, 46, 1247, 46, 272, 1008, 8, 991, 583, 248, 59, 22827, 2, 5517, 2, 309, 17, 1247, 1, 10635, 2, 1671, 68, 40, 35, 305, 2696, 692, 9, 1367, 2792, 2, 1557, 1621, 20, 3178, 5517, 363]",1584.0,24435449,Targeting STAT5 hematologic malignancies inhibition bromodomain extra-terminal BET bromodomain BRD2,0,0.0
Safety profile of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi in a large compassionate-use trial.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-01-16,"L-Asparaginase is an integral component of standard chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Clinical hypersensitivity, a common reason for treatment discontinuation, has been reported in 10-30% of patients receiving Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase. After hypersensitivity, E. coli-derived asparaginase should be discontinued and an alternative asparaginase preparation, such as asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi, may be initiated. We conducted a compassionate-use study to collect additional safety information on asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi and to support FDA approval of the product. Patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL; N = 1368) who developed a hypersensitivity reaction (grade ≥2) to an E. coli-derived asparaginase participated in this trial. The recommended asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi dose was 25,000 IU/m(2) three days per week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) for two consecutive weeks for each missed pegylated E. coli-derived asparaginase dose and 25,000 IU/m(2) for each missed nonpegylated asparaginase dose for the completion of their planned asparaginase treatment. Adverse event reports and/or case report forms were completed for 940 patients. The most common adverse event (AE) was hypersensitivity (13.6%). Eighteen patients (1.9%) died during the study.

Phase I and extension study of clofarabine plus cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2013-12-17,"Clofarabine is a nucleoside analogue with activity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Based on the hypothesis that clofarabine inhibits DNA repair after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, we designed a phase I and extension study to evaluate the combination of clofarabine and cyclophosphamide in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. The continual reassessment method (CRM) was used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Fifty patients with a median age of 30 years (range, 21-72 years) were enrolled, 30 of whom were part of the phase I group. Clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) intravenously daily × 3 days and cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m(2) intravenously every 12 hours × 3 days were established as the MTDs. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) included diarrhea, transaminase elevations, and skin rashes. The response rate of the whole study group was 14%, including 10% of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp). Three responses occurred in patients with primary refractory disease. Early mortality (< 30 days) was 6%. The median duration of response was 69 days (range, 5-315 days). Median overall survival was about 3 months.

Eating behavior and BMI in adolescent survivors of brain tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,2014-01-22,"Elevated body mass index (BMI) has been reported in pediatric cancer survivors. It is unclear whether this is related to altered energy intake (via disordered eating), decreased energy expenditure (via limited exercise), or treatment-related direct/indirect changes. The aims of this study are to describe the occurrence of overweight and obesity, exercise frequency, and the extent of disordered eating patterns in this sample of survivors, and to examine relationships among BMI, eating patterns, exercise frequency, and demographic and disease and treatment-related variables to identify those survivors most at risk for overweight/obesity. This cross-sectional study recruited 98 cancer survivors (50 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 48 brain tumor [BT]), aged 12 to 17 years and ≥12 months posttreatment from a large pediatric oncology hospital. Survivors completed health behavior measures assessing disordered eating patterns and physical activity. Clinical variables were obtained through medical record review. Univariate analyses were conducted to make comparisons on health behaviors by diagnosis, gender, treatment history, and BMI category. Fifty-two percent of ALL survivors and 41.7% of BT survivors were classified as overweight/obese. Overweight/obesity status was associated with higher cognitive restraint (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.1). Only 12% of ALL survivors and 8.3% of BT survivors met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical activity. Males reported more physical activity, t(96) = 2.2, P < .05.

"Aberrant expression of SALL4 in acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia: mechanism, function, and implication for a potential novel therapeutic target.",Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2014-01-23,"Treatment for high-risk pediatric and adult acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains challenging. Exploring novel pathways in B-ALL could lead to new therapy. Our previous study has shown that stem cell factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in B-ALL, but its functional roles and the mechanism that accounts for its upregulation in B-ALL remain unexplored. To address this question, we first surveyed the existing B-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples for SALL4 expression. We then selected the B-ALL cell lines with the highest SALL4 expression for functional studies. RNA interference was used to downregulate SALL4 expression in these cell lines. When compared with control cells, SALL4 knockdown cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis in vitro, and decreased engraftment in a xenotransplant model in vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that in SALL4 knockdown B-ALL cells, multiple caspase members involved in cell apoptosis pathway were upregulated. Next, we explored the mechanisms of aberrant SALL4 expression in B-ALL. We found that hypomethylation of the SALL4 CpG islands was correlated with its high expression. Furthermore, treatment of low SALL4-expressing B-ALL cell lines with DNA methylation inhibitor led to demethylation of the SALL4 CpG and increased SALL4 expression. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to show that the aberrant expression of SALL4 in B-ALL is associated with hypomethylation, and that SALL4 plays a key role in B-ALL cell survival and could be a potential novel target in B-ALL treatment.",Clinical Trial,2189.0,15.0,Treatment high-risk pediatric adult acute B lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL remains challenging Exploring novel pathways B-ALL lead new therapy previous shown stem factor SALL4 aberrantly expressed B-ALL functional roles mechanism accounts upregulation B-ALL remain unexplored address question surveyed existing B-ALL lines primary patient SALL4 expression selected B-ALL lines highest SALL4 expression functional studies RNA interference downregulate SALL4 expression lines compared control SALL4 knockdown exhibited decreased proliferation increased apoptosis vitro decreased engraftment xenotransplant model vivo expression showed SALL4 knockdown B-ALL multiple caspase members involved apoptosis pathway upregulated explored mechanisms aberrant SALL4 expression B-ALL hypomethylation SALL4 CpG islands correlated high expression Furthermore treatment low SALL4-expressing B-ALL lines DNA methylation inhibitor led demethylation SALL4 CpG increased SALL4 expression summary knowledge aberrant expression SALL4 B-ALL associated hypomethylation SALL4 plays key role B-ALL survival potential novel target B-ALL treatment,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 9, 64, 43, 815, 2, 780, 286, 132, 31, 1275, 132, 62, 469, 1950, 4378, 229, 460, 4, 132, 62, 359, 1122, 6, 217, 36, 114, 698, 45, 71, 443, 17, 452, 31, 161, 16439, 16, 5619, 570, 4, 132, 62, 84, 211, 583, 1790, 2, 3, 670, 17, 4162, 9, 211, 2218, 4, 132, 62, 918, 8398, 6, 1539, 26, 2840, 21, 157, 3696, 3, 1692, 132, 62, 31, 285, 2, 86, 69, 347, 9, 16439, 55, 21, 818, 715, 3, 132, 62, 31, 285, 5, 3, 1076, 16439, 55, 9, 583, 94, 893, 3182, 10, 95, 6, 10261, 16439, 55, 4, 46, 31, 285, 198, 72, 5, 182, 37, 16439, 1563, 37, 1416, 340, 31, 457, 101, 351, 4, 439, 2, 340, 2881, 4, 8, 28800, 202, 4, 386, 145, 55, 65, 224, 17, 4, 16439, 1563, 132, 62, 37, 232, 1469, 1684, 646, 4, 31, 351, 308, 11, 2684, 1305, 21, 1443, 3, 483, 1, 1898, 16439, 55, 4, 132, 62, 21, 204, 17, 4441, 1, 3, 16439, 2075, 6046, 10, 438, 5, 211, 64, 55, 798, 24, 1, 154, 16439, 1046, 132, 62, 31, 285, 5, 261, 569, 230, 836, 6, 6800, 1, 3, 16439, 2075, 2, 101, 16439, 55, 4, 1962, 6, 114, 922, 21, 32, 3, 157, 6, 514, 17, 3, 1898, 55, 1, 16439, 4, 132, 62, 16, 41, 5, 4441, 2, 17, 16439, 1698, 8, 825, 200, 4, 132, 62, 31, 25, 2, 359, 40, 8, 174, 229, 283, 4, 132, 62, 24]",1550.0,24463278,Aberrant expression SALL4 acute B lymphoblastic leukemia mechanism function implication potential novel therapeutic target,4,0.004371584699453552
Incidental detection of late subsequent intracranial neoplasms with magnetic resonance imaging among adult survivors of childhood cancer.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2014-02-02,"Survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms. In long-term survivors of childhood malignancies treated with and without cranial radiation therapy (CRT), undergoing unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, we estimated detection of intracranial neoplasms. To investigate neurocognitive outcomes, 219 survivors of childhood cancer underwent unenhanced screening MRI of the brain. Of the survivors, 164 had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (125 received CRT) and 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (none received CRT). MRI examinations were reviewed and systematically coded by a single neuroradiologist. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared for survivors with and without subsequent neoplasms. Nineteen of the 219 survivors (8.7 %) had a total of 31 subsequent intracranial neoplasms identified by neuroimaging at a median time of 25 years (range 12-46 years) from diagnosis. All neoplasms occurred after CRT, except for a single vestibular schwannoma within the cervical radiation field in a HL survivor. The prevalence of subsequent neoplasms after CRT exposure was 14.4 % (18 of 125). By noncontrast MRI, intracranial neoplasms were most suggestive of meningiomas. Most patients presented with no specific, localizing neurological complaints. In addition to the schwannoma, six tumors were resected based on results of MRI screening, all of which were meningiomas on histologic review. Unenhanced brain MRI of long-term survivors of childhood cancer detected a substantial number of intracranial neoplasms. Screening for early detection of intracranial neoplasms among aging survivors of childhood cancer who received CRT should be evaluated. The high prevalence of incidentally detected subsequent intracranial neoplasms after CRT in long-term survivors of childhood cancer and the minimal symptoms reported by those with intracranial tumors in our study indicate that brain MRI screening of long-term survivors who received CRT may be warranted.

Impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on minimal residual disease and outcome in childhood Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-02-05,"Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve the outcome of patients with childhood Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when they are incorporated into postremission induction chemotherapy. To date, no data are available on the impact of TKIs on minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of induction therapy among patients who have a poor early response to 2 weeks of induction therapy that does not include TKIs. The authors analyzed the early response to TKIs during remission induction in children with Ph-positive ALL who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. MRD was measured on days 15 and 42 of induction. TKIs were incorporated into induction therapy on day 22 in the post-TKI era.

Pharmacokinetic evaluation of vincristine for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,2014-02-10,"Vincristine is a key agent for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other lymphoid malignancies. The strong antineoplastic activity of vincristine has been limited by its pharmacological characteristics. This paper reviews the role of vincristine in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. This review summarizes its efficacy and toxicity, and focuses on the pharmacokinetic features of vincristine that affect clinical outcomes. As a single agent, vincristine is associated with brief and incomplete responses, but in combination with other agents, vincristine has dramatically improved the outcomes of lymphoid malignancies such as ALL. Vincristine is a key drug of hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone, an intensive chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of ALL, and of cyclophosphamid, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone, which has been used extensively in the treatment of patients with aggressive or indolent lymphomas and Richter syndrome. The strong antileukemic activity of vincristine has been limited by its variable and unpredictable pharmacological characteristics, narrow therapeutic index and neurotoxicity profile. These characteristics prompted the development of liposomal vincristine, which has optimized its clinical application.

Pharmacokinetics-based integration of multiple doses of intravenous pegaspargase in a pediatric regimen for adults with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-02-10,"Asparaginase treatment is standard in all pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens, whereas in adults, it is either excluded or administered for a shorter duration. Several adult ALL protocols are adapting pediatric regimens, but the optimal implementation of asparaginase is not well studied, considering its potential higher toxicity. We studied a pegaspargase dosing strategy based on its pharmacokinetic characteristics in adults. Between 2004 and 2009, 51 adults age 18 to 57 years with newly diagnosed ALL were treated with a regimen adapted from a pediatric trial that included six doses of intravenous pegaspargase at 2,000 IU/m(2) per dose. Intervals between doses were longer than 4 weeks and rationally synchronized with other chemotherapy drugs to prevent overlapping toxicities. Pegaspargase was administered with steroids to reduce hypersensitivity. Asparaginase-related toxicities were monitored after 173 pegaspargase doses. The most common grade 3/4 asparaginase-related toxicities were lengthy hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis, occasionally resulting in subsequent treatment delays. All toxicities resolved spontaneously. Forty-five percent of patients were able to receive all six doses of pegaspargase, and 61% received ≥ three doses. In only 20% of patients, the drug was discontinued after pegaspargase-related serious toxicity. Ninety-six percent achieved complete remission, almost all within 4 weeks, and a low induction death rate was seen. Seven-year disease-free and overall survival were 58% and 51%, respectively.

Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity and leukoencephalopathy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-02-18,"Methotrexate (MTX) can cause significant clinical neurotoxicity and asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy. We sought to identify clinical, pharmacokinetic, and genetic risk factors for these MTX-related toxicities during childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy and provide data on safety of intrathecal and high-dose MTX rechallenge in patients with neurotoxicity. Prospective brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at four time points for 369 children with ALL treated in a contemporary study that included five courses of high-dose MTX and 13 to 25 doses of triple intrathecal therapy. Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate clinical and pharmacokinetic factors, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify germline polymorphisms for their association with neurotoxicities. Fourteen patients (3.8%) developed MTX-related clinical neurotoxicity. Of 13 patients rechallenged with intrathecal and/or high-dose MTX, 12 did not experience recurrence of neurotoxicity. Leukoencephalopathy was found in 73 (20.6%) of 355 asymptomatic patients and in all symptomatic patients and persisted in 74% of asymptomatic and 58% of symptomatic patients at the end of therapy. A high 42-hour plasma MTX to leucovorin ratio (measure of MTX exposure) was associated with increased risk of leukoencephalopathy in multivariable analysis (P = .038). GWAS revealed polymorphisms in genes enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways with plausible mechanistic roles in neurotoxicity. MTX-related clinical neurotoxicity is transient, and most patients can receive subsequent MTX without recurrence of acute or subacute symptoms. All symptomatic patients and one in five asymptomatic patients develop leukoencephalopathy that can persist until the end of therapy.

Efficacy and toxicity management of 19-28z CAR T cell therapy in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2014-02-01,"We report on 16 patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that we treated with autologous T cells expressing the 19-28z chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific to the CD19 antigen. The overall complete response rate was 88%, which allowed us to transition most of these patients to a standard-of-care allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). This therapy was as effective in high-risk patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) disease as in those with relapsed disease after previous allo-SCT. Through systematic analysis of clinical data and serum cytokine levels over the first 21 days after T cell infusion, we have defined diagnostic criteria for a severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS), with the goal of better identifying the subset of patients who will likely require therapeutic intervention with corticosteroids or interleukin-6 receptor blockade to curb the sCRS.

We compared changes in survival after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among children (n = 981), AYAs (n = 1218), and older adults (n = 469) who underwent transplantation over 3 time periods: 1990 to 1995, 1996 to 2001, and 2002 to 2007. Five-year survival varied inversely with age group. Survival improved over time in AYAs and paralleled that seen in children; however, overall survival did not change over time for older adults. Survival improvements were primarily related to lower rates of early treatment-related mortality in the most recent era. For all cohorts, relapse rates did not change over time. A subset of 222 AYAs between the ages of 15 and 25 at 46 pediatric or 49 adult centers were also analyzed to describe differences by center type.

Inhibition of calcineurin combined with dasatinib has direct and indirect anti-leukemia effects against BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2014-06-19,"Treatment of BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia has been revolutionized with the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, patients with BCR-ABL1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia and subsets of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia are at high risk of relapse despite kinase inhibition therapy, necessitating novel treatment strategies. We previously reported synthetic lethality in BCR-ABL1(+) leukemia cells by blocking both calcineurin/NFAT signaling and BCR-ABL1, independent of drug efflux inhibition by cyclosporine. Here, using RNA-interference we confirm that calcineurin inhibition sensitizes BCR-ABL1(+) cells to tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro. However, when we performed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of dasatinib and cyclosporine in mice, we found that co-administration of cyclosporine increases peak concentrations and the area under the curve of dasatinib, which contributes to the enhanced disease control. We also report the clinical experience of two subjects in whom we observed more hematopoietic toxicity than expected while enrolled in a Phase Ib trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of adding cyclosporine to dasatinib in humans. Thus, the anti-leukemia benefit of co-administration of cyclosporine and dasatinib is mechanistically pleiotropic, but may not be tolerable, at least as administered in this trial. These data highlight some of the challenges associated with combining targeted agents to treat leukemia.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",2042.0,8.0,Treatment BCR-ABL1 leukemia revolutionized development tyrosine kinase inhibitors patients BCR-ABL1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia subsets patients chronic myeloid leukemia high risk relapse despite kinase inhibition therapy necessitating novel treatment strategies previously reported synthetic lethality BCR-ABL1 leukemia blocking calcineurin/NFAT signaling BCR-ABL1 independent drug efflux inhibition cyclosporine RNA-interference confirm calcineurin inhibition sensitizes BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibition vitro performed pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies dasatinib cyclosporine mice co-administration cyclosporine increases peak concentrations area curve dasatinib contributes enhanced disease control report clinical experience subjects observed hematopoietic toxicity expected enrolled Phase Ib trial designed assess safety tolerability adding cyclosporine dasatinib humans anti-leukemia benefit co-administration cyclosporine dasatinib mechanistically pleiotropic tolerable administered trial highlight challenges associated combining targeted agents treat leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 1, 1062, 3557, 71, 85, 5746, 5, 3, 193, 1, 564, 216, 222, 137, 7, 5, 1062, 3557, 286, 1275, 2, 1890, 1, 7, 5, 442, 533, 32, 28, 64, 43, 1, 429, 550, 216, 297, 36, 8365, 229, 24, 422, 21, 373, 210, 3273, 3266, 4, 1062, 3557, 37, 20, 2521, 110, 12028, 19518, 314, 2, 1062, 3557, 306, 1, 234, 7043, 297, 20, 9112, 467, 75, 893, 3182, 21, 1843, 17, 12028, 297, 6229, 1062, 3557, 37, 6, 564, 216, 297, 4, 439, 137, 198, 21, 173, 1456, 2, 2424, 94, 1, 1674, 2, 9112, 4, 399, 21, 204, 17, 1269, 634, 1, 9112, 1106, 2944, 1003, 2, 3, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 1, 1674, 92, 2444, 6, 3, 651, 34, 182, 21, 120, 414, 3, 38, 730, 1, 100, 976, 4, 953, 21, 164, 80, 1007, 155, 76, 1336, 369, 346, 4, 8, 124, 3180, 160, 1114, 6, 423, 3, 367, 2, 1543, 1, 2726, 9112, 6, 1674, 4, 3218, 631, 3, 312, 2647, 247, 1, 1269, 634, 1, 9112, 2, 1674, 16, 4187, 7872, 84, 68, 44, 40, 2668, 28, 506, 22, 468, 4, 26, 160, 46, 74, 1817, 476, 1, 3, 1427, 41, 5, 1525, 238, 183, 6, 943]",1394.0,24891015,Inhibition calcineurin combined dasatinib direct indirect anti-leukemia effects BCR-ABL1 leukemia,4,0.004371584699453552
Polymorphisms of asparaginase pathway and asparaginase-related complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-06-06,"Asparaginase (ASNase) is a standard and critical component in the therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but it is also associated with several toxicities. We recently reported the results of an association study between ASNase pathway genes and event-free survival (EFS) in childhood patients with ALL. The same polymorphisms were interrogated here in relation to allergies, pancreatitis, and thrombotic events following treatment with E. coli ASNase. Among patients of the discovery group, allergies, and pancreatitis were more frequent in individuals who are homozygous for the triple-repeat allele (3R) of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene, resulting in remarkably higher risk of these toxicities associated with 3R3R genotype [OR for allergies, 14.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.6-58.7; P < 0.0005 and OR for pancreatitis, 8.6; 95% CI, 2.0-37.3; P = 0.01]. In contrast, the ASNS haplotype *1 harboring double-repeat (2R) allele had protective effect against these adverse reactions (P ≤ 0.01). The same haplotype was previously reported to confer reduction in EFS. The risk effect of 3R3R genotype was not replicated in the validation cohort, whereas the protective effect of haplotype *1 against allergies was maintained (P ≤ 0.002). Analysis with additional polymorphisms in ASNS locus in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed that haplotype *1 is diversified in several subtypes of which one was associated with reduced in vitro sensitivity to ASNase (rs10486009, P = 0.01) possibly explaining an association seen in clinical setting. This finding might have implication for treatment individualization in ALL and other cancers using asparagine depletion strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 21(2); 329-34. ©2014 AACR.

The poison oligonucleotide F10 is highly effective against acute lymphoblastic leukemia while sparing normal hematopoietic cells.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2014-06-01,"F10 is an oligonucleotide based on the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitory 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolite, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate. We sought to determine the activity of F10 against preclinical models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). F10 treatment resulted in robust induction of apoptosis that could not be equaled by 100 fold more 5-FU. F10 was more potent than Ara-C and doxorubicin against a panel of murine and human ALL cells with an average IC50 value of 1.48 nM (range 0.07 to 5.4 nM). F10 was more than 1000 times more potent than 5-FU. In vivo, F10 treatment significantly increased survival in 2 separate syngeneic ALL mouse models and 3 separate xenograft models. F10 also protected mice from leukemia-induced weight loss. In ALL cells made resistant to Ara-C, F10 remained highly active in vitro and in vivo. Using labeled F10, uptake by the ALL cell lines DG75 and SUP-B15 was rapid and profoundly temperature-dependent. Both cell lines demonstrated increased uptake compared to normal murine lineage- depleted marrow cells. Consistent with this decreased uptake, F10 treatment did not alter the ability of human hematopoietic stem cells to engraft in immunodeficient mice.

Maturation stage of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia determines BCL-2 versus BCL-XL dependence and sensitivity to ABT-199.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2014-07-03,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy derived from immature B-lymphoid and T-lymphoid cells (T-ALL). In T-ALL, there is an early T-cell progenitor (ETP) subgroup that has a very high risk for relapse. In this study, we used mitochondrial BH3 profiling to determine antiapoptotic protein dependencies in T-ALL. We found that T-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples are dependent upon BCL-XL, except when the cancer bears an ETP phenotype, in which case it is BCL-2 dependent. These distinctions directly relate to differential sensitivity to the BH3 mimetics ABT-263 and ABT-199, both in vitro and in vivo. We thus describe for the first time a change of antiapoptotic protein dependence that is related to the differentiation stage of the leukemic clone.

The Sox4/Tcf7l1 axis promotes progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2014-07-04,"The transcription factor Sox4 plays an indispensable role in the development of early progenitor B cells from hematopoietic stem cells. However, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant counterpart of normal progenitor B cells, is not fully understood. Here we show that SOX4 is highly expressed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To systematically study the function of Sox4 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we established a genetically defined mouse leukemia model by transforming progenitor B cells carrying a floxed Sox4 allele and inducing deletion of the allele by the self-excising Cre recombinase. This model allowed us to work with two groups of leukemic cells that had either one copy or both copies of Sox4 deleted. We found that depletion of Sox4 in transformed cells in vitro reduced cell growth in vitro and the progression of leukemia in vivo. Moreover, depletion of Sox4 in leukemic cells in vivo prolonged the survival of the mice, suggesting that it could be a potential target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Our microarray and bioChIP studies revealed that Tcf7l1 was the key gene directly regulated by Sox4. Knockdown of Tcf7l1 reduced cell proliferation, just as did knockout of Sox4, and ectopic expression of Tcf7l1 could reverse the effect of Sox4 knockout on cell proliferation. These data suggest that Sox4 and Tcf7l1 form a functional axis that promotes the progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

This study investigated neurologic morbidity and its effect on quality of life in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. Prospective, single institution, cross-sectional, institutional review board-approved study of long-term ALL survivors. Participants were recruited from institutional clinics. Participants answered an investigator-administered questionnaire followed by evaluation by a neurologist. Quality of life (QOL) was also assessed. Of the 162 participants recruited over a 3-year period, 83.3% reported at least one neurologic symptom of interest, 16.7% had single symptom, 11.1% had two symptoms, and 55.6% had three or more symptoms. Symptoms were mild and disability was low in the majority of participants with neurologic symptoms. Median age at ALL diagnosis was 3.9 years (0.4-18.6), median age at study enrollment was 15.7 years (6.9-28.9), and median time from completion of ALL therapy was 7.4 years (1.9-20.3). On multivariable analyses, female sex correlated with presence of dizziness, urinary incontinence, constipation, and neuropathy; use of ≥10 doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy correlated with urinary incontinence, back pain, and neuropathy; cranial radiation with ataxia; history of ALL relapse with fatigue; and CNS leukemia at diagnosis with seizures. Decline in mental QOL was associated with migraine and tension type headaches, while physical QOL was impaired by presence of dizziness and falls. Overall, good QOL and physical function was maintained by a majority of participants. Neurologic symptoms were present in 83% long-term ALL survivors.

Central nervous system relapse in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-07-10,"Central nervous system (CNS) relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) confers a poor prognosis in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Preventing CNS relapse after HSCT remains a therapeutic challenge, and criteria for post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis have not been addressed. In a 3-center retrospective analysis, we reviewed the data for 457 adult patients with ALL who received a first allogeneic HSCT in first or second complete remission (CR). All patients received CNS prophylaxis as part of their upfront therapy for ALL, but post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis practice varied by institution and was administered to 48% of the patients. Eighteen patients (4%) developed CNS relapse after HSCT (isolated CNS relapse, n = 8; combined bone marrow and CNS relapse, n = 10). Patients with a previous history of CNS involvement with leukemia had a significantly higher rate for CNS relapse (P = .002), and pretransplantation CNS involvement was the only risk factor for post-transplantation CNS relapse found in this study. We failed to find a significant effect of post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis to prevent relapse after transplantation. Furthermore, no benefit for post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis could be detected when a subgroup analysis of patients with (P = .10) and without previous CNS involvement (P = .52) was performed. Finally, we could not find any significant effect for intensity of the transplantation conditioning regimen on CNS relapse after HSCT. In conclusion, CNS relapse is an uncommon event after HSCT for patients with ALL in CR1 or CR2, but with higher risk among patients with CNS involvement before transplantation. Furthermore, neither the use of post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis nor the intensity of the HSCT conditioning regimen made a significant difference in the rate of post-HSCT CNS relapse.",Journal Article,2021.0,19.0,Central nervous CNS relapse allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation HSCT confers poor prognosis adult patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia Preventing CNS relapse HSCT remains therapeutic challenge criteria post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis addressed 3-center retrospective reviewed 457 adult patients received allogeneic HSCT second complete remission CR patients received CNS prophylaxis upfront therapy post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis practice varied institution administered 48 patients Eighteen patients 4 developed CNS relapse HSCT isolated CNS relapse n 8 combined bone marrow CNS relapse n 10 Patients previous history CNS involvement leukemia significantly higher rate CNS relapse P .002 pretransplantation CNS involvement risk factor post-transplantation CNS relapse failed significant effect post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis prevent relapse transplantation Furthermore benefit post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis detected subgroup patients P .10 previous CNS involvement P .52 performed Finally significant effect intensity transplantation conditioning regimen CNS relapse HSCT CNS relapse uncommon event HSCT patients CR1 CR2 higher risk patients CNS involvement transplantation Furthermore use post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis intensity HSCT conditioning regimen significant difference rate post-HSCT CNS relapse,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[854, 1880, 398, 1025, 429, 50, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 4020, 8, 334, 356, 4, 780, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 3017, 1025, 429, 50, 1703, 469, 8, 189, 1745, 2, 371, 9, 539, 1703, 1025, 2049, 47, 44, 85, 2814, 4, 8, 27, 574, 459, 65, 21, 446, 3, 74, 9, 13372, 780, 7, 5, 62, 54, 103, 8, 157, 1063, 1703, 4, 157, 15, 419, 236, 734, 684, 62, 7, 103, 1025, 2049, 22, 760, 1, 136, 2941, 36, 9, 62, 84, 539, 497, 1025, 2049, 758, 2051, 20, 731, 2, 10, 468, 6, 576, 1, 3, 7, 3195, 7, 39, 276, 1025, 429, 50, 1703, 1355, 1025, 429, 78, 66, 397, 581, 2, 1025, 429, 78, 79, 7, 5, 8, 698, 532, 1, 1025, 799, 5, 42, 8, 97, 142, 116, 9, 1025, 429, 19, 1111, 2, 9367, 1025, 799, 10, 3, 158, 43, 161, 9, 539, 497, 1025, 429, 204, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1551, 6, 2469, 8, 93, 254, 1, 539, 497, 1025, 2049, 6, 1682, 429, 50, 497, 798, 77, 247, 9, 539, 497, 1025, 2049, 359, 40, 530, 198, 8, 1363, 65, 1, 7, 5, 19, 79, 2, 187, 698, 1025, 799, 19, 653, 10, 173, 1368, 21, 359, 44, 2469, 500, 93, 254, 9, 837, 1, 3, 497, 1933, 477, 23, 1025, 429, 50, 1703, 4, 1221, 1025, 429, 16, 35, 2052, 774, 50, 1703, 9, 7, 5, 62, 4, 4516, 15, 7865, 84, 5, 142, 43, 107, 7, 5, 1025, 799, 348, 497, 798, 2174, 3, 119, 1, 539, 1703, 1025, 2049, 2110, 3, 837, 1, 3, 1703, 1933, 477, 1229, 8, 93, 523, 4, 3, 116, 1, 539, 1703, 1025, 429]",1800.0,25017763,Central nervous relapse adults acute lymphoblastic leukemia allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation,2,0.002185792349726776
"Skeletal, neuromuscular and fitness impairments among children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2014-08-20,"This study describes skeletal, neuromuscular and fitness impairments among 109 children (median age 10 [range 4-18] years, 65.1% male, 63.3% white) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Outcomes were measured 7-10 days after diagnosis and compared to age- and sex-specific expected values. Associations between function and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were evaluated with logistic regression. Children with ALL had sub-optimal bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score/height (mean ± standard error: - 0.53 ± 0.16 vs. 0.00 ± 0.14, p < 0.01), body mass index percentile (57.6 ± 3.15 vs. 50.0 ± 3.27%, p = 0.02), quadriceps strength (201.9 ± 8.3 vs. 236.1 ± 5.4 N, p < 0.01), 6 min walk distance (385.0 ± 13.1 vs. 628.2 ± 7.1 m, p < 0.001) and Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency scores (23 ± 2.5 vs. 50 ± 3.4%, p < 0.01).

Augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster therapy in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-17,"Various trials have reported improved outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received treatment with pediatric-based regimens. Those reports prompted the current investigation of the pediatric augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (ABFM) regimen in AYA patients. The results were compared with those from a similar population that received the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen. Eighty-five patients ages 12 to 40 years who had Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL received the ABFM regimen from October 2006 through April 2012. Their outcome was compared with outcomes in 71 historic AYA patients who received hyper-CVAD from the authors' institution. Patient and disease characteristics, as well as minimal residual disease status, were analyzed for their impact on outcomes. The complete response rate with ABFM was 94%. The 3-year complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 70% and 74%, respectively. For patients aged ≤21 years, the 3-year CRD and OS rates were 72% and 85%, respectively; and, for patients ages 21 to 40 years, the respective rates were 69% and 60%. The initial white blood cell count was an independent predictive factor of OS and CRD. The minimal residual disease status on days 29 and 84 of therapy also were predictive of long-term outcomes. Severe regimen toxicities included transient hepatotoxicity in 35% to 39% of patients, pancreatitis in 11% of patients, osteonecrosis in 11% of patients, and thrombosis in 22% of patients. The 3-year OS rate was 74% in the ABFM group versus 71% in the hyper-CVAD group, and the corresponding 3-year CRD rate was 70% versus 66%, respectively. ABFM was tolerable in AYA patients with ALL but was not associated with significant improvements in CRD and OS compared with hyper-CVAD.",Journal Article,2014.0,49.0,trials reported improved outcomes adolescents young adults AYAs acute lymphoblastic leukemia received treatment pediatric-based regimens reports prompted current investigation pediatric augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster ABFM regimen AYA patients compared similar population received hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin dexamethasone hyper-CVAD regimen Eighty-five patients ages 12 40 years Philadelphia chromosome Ph -negative received ABFM regimen October 2006 April 2012 outcome compared outcomes 71 historic AYA patients received hyper-CVAD authors institution Patient disease characteristics minimal residual disease status impact outcomes complete response rate ABFM 94 3-year complete remission duration CRD overall survival OS rates 70 74 respectively patients aged ≤21 years 3-year CRD OS rates 72 85 respectively patients ages 21 40 years respective rates 69 60 initial white blood count independent predictive factor OS CRD minimal residual disease status days 29 84 therapy predictive long-term outcomes Severe regimen toxicities included transient hepatotoxicity 35 39 patients pancreatitis 11 patients osteonecrosis 11 patients thrombosis 22 patients 3-year OS rate 74 ABFM group versus 71 hyper-CVAD group corresponding 3-year CRD rate 70 versus 66 respectively ABFM tolerable AYA patients associated significant improvements CRD OS compared hyper-CVAD,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[747, 143, 47, 210, 231, 123, 9, 3101, 2, 1169, 857, 6145, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 54, 103, 24, 5, 815, 90, 472, 135, 1198, 4140, 3, 291, 940, 1, 3, 815, 4277, 20405, 23389, 26350, 20857, 477, 4, 4598, 7, 3, 99, 11, 72, 5, 135, 29, 8, 288, 266, 17, 103, 3, 6201, 1112, 2132, 856, 2, 1217, 4855, 5574, 477, 2207, 365, 7, 2165, 133, 6, 327, 60, 54, 42, 3006, 1170, 2058, 199, 62, 103, 3, 20857, 477, 29, 2551, 1324, 298, 2292, 1195, 136, 228, 10, 72, 5, 123, 4, 792, 6875, 4598, 7, 54, 103, 4855, 5574, 29, 3, 738, 731, 69, 2, 34, 374, 22, 149, 22, 1048, 753, 34, 156, 11, 311, 9, 136, 345, 23, 123, 3, 236, 51, 116, 5, 20857, 10, 960, 3, 27, 111, 236, 734, 654, 9366, 2, 63, 25, 118, 151, 11, 431, 2, 794, 106, 9, 7, 1032, 22725, 60, 3, 27, 111, 9366, 2, 118, 151, 11, 720, 2, 772, 106, 2, 9, 7, 2165, 239, 6, 327, 60, 3, 3847, 151, 11, 790, 2, 335, 3, 388, 886, 315, 31, 1276, 10, 35, 306, 464, 161, 1, 118, 2, 9366, 3, 1048, 753, 34, 156, 23, 162, 462, 2, 874, 1, 36, 120, 11, 464, 1, 319, 337, 123, 905, 477, 385, 159, 2473, 6667, 4, 465, 6, 587, 1, 7, 4535, 4, 175, 1, 7, 5404, 4, 175, 1, 7, 2, 2839, 4, 350, 1, 7, 3, 27, 111, 118, 116, 10, 794, 4, 3, 20857, 87, 185, 792, 4, 3, 4855, 5574, 87, 2, 3, 1734, 27, 111, 9366, 116, 10, 431, 185, 700, 106, 20857, 10, 2668, 4, 4598, 7, 5, 62, 84, 10, 44, 41, 5, 93, 1474, 4, 9366, 2, 118, 72, 5, 4855, 5574]",1828.0,25042398,Augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster therapy adolescents young adults AYAs acute lymphoblastic leukemia,8,0.008743169398907104
Outcomes of children with BCR-ABL1–like acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with risk-directed therapy based on the levels of minimal residual disease.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-09-01,"BCR-ABL1–like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a recently identified B-cell ALL (B-ALL)subtype with poor outcome that exhibits a gene expression profile similar to BCR-ABL1-positive ALL but lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. We examined the outcome of children with BCR-ABL1–like ALL treated with risk-directed therapy based on minimal residual disease (MRD) levels during remission induction. Among 422 patients with B-ALL enrolled onto the Total Therapy XV study between 2000 and 2007, 344 had adequate samples for gene expression profiling. Next-generation sequencing and/or analysis of genes known to be altered in B-ALL were performed in patients with BCR-ABL1–likeALL who had available material. Outcome was compared between patients with and those without BCR-ABL1–like ALL. Forty (11.6%) of the 344 patients had BCR-ABL1–like ALL. They were significantly more likely to be male, have Down syndrome, and have higher MRD levels on day 19 and at the end of induction than did other patients with B-ALL. Among 25 patients comprehensively studied for genetic abnormalities, 11 harbored a genomic rearrangement of CRLF2, six had fusion transcripts responsive to ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors or JAK inhibitors, and seven had mutations involving the Ras signaling pathway. There were no significant differences in event-free survival (90.0% +/- 4.7% [SE] v. 88.4% +/- .9% at 5 years; P = .41or in overall survival (92.5% +/- 4.2% v. 95.1% +/- 1.3% at 5 years; P = .41) between patients with and without BCR-ABL1–like ALL.

We compared total hospital length of stay in the first 100 days after HCT in 1577 patients with acute leukemia in remission who underwent HCT with an umbilical cord blood (UCB), matched unrelated donor (MUD), or mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) graft between 2008 and 2011. To ensure a relatively homogenous study population, the analysis was limited to patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission who underwent HCT in the United States. To account for early deaths, we compared the number of days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days post-transplantation. For children who received myeloablative conditioning, the median time alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days was 50 days for single UCB recipients, 54 days for double UCB recipients, and 60 days for MUD bone marrow (BM) recipients. In multivariate analysis, use of UCB was significantly associated with fewer days alive and out of the hospital compared with MUD BM. For adults who received myeloablative conditioning, the median time alive and out of the hospital in first 100 days was 52 days for single UCB recipients, 55 days for double UCB recipients, 69 days for MUD BM recipients, 75 days for MUD peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) recipients, 63 days for MMUD BM recipients, and 67 days for MMUD PBSC recipients. In multivariate analysis, UCB and MMUD BM recipients had fewer days alive and out of the hospital compared with recipients of other graft sources. For adults who received a reduced-intensity preparative regimen, the median time alive and out of the hospital during the first 100 days was 65 days for single UCB recipients, 63 days for double UCB recipients, 79 days for MUD PBSC recipients, and 79 days for MMUD PBSC recipients. Similar to the other 2 groups, receipt of UCB was associated with a fewer days alive and out of the hospital. In conclusion, length of stay in the first 100 days post-transplantation varies by graft source and is longer for UCB HCT recipients. These data provide insight into the resource needs of patients who undergo HCT with these various graft sources.",Comparative Study,2008.0,21.0,studies shown comparable survival outcomes different graft sources relative resource needs hematopoietic transplantation HCT graft source studied compared total hospital length stay 100 days HCT 1577 patients acute leukemia remission underwent HCT umbilical cord blood UCB matched unrelated donor MUD mismatched unrelated donor MMUD graft 2008 2011 ensure relatively homogenous population limited patients acute myelogenous leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia second complete remission underwent HCT United States account early deaths compared number days alive hospital 100 days post-transplantation children received myeloablative conditioning median time alive hospital 100 days 50 days single UCB recipients 54 days double UCB recipients 60 days MUD bone marrow BM recipients multivariate use UCB significantly associated fewer days alive hospital compared MUD BM adults received myeloablative conditioning median time alive hospital 100 days 52 days single UCB recipients 55 days double UCB recipients 69 days MUD BM recipients 75 days MUD peripheral blood stem PBSC recipients 63 days MMUD BM recipients 67 days MMUD PBSC recipients multivariate UCB MMUD BM recipients fewer days alive hospital compared recipients graft sources adults received reduced-intensity preparative regimen median time alive hospital 100 days 65 days single UCB recipients 63 days double UCB recipients 79 days MUD PBSC recipients 79 days MMUD PBSC recipients Similar 2 groups receipt UCB associated fewer days alive hospital length stay 100 days post-transplantation varies graft source longer UCB HCT recipients provide insight resource needs patients undergo HCT graft sources,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[392, 94, 47, 443, 1279, 25, 123, 5, 338, 1599, 3375, 84, 3, 580, 3069, 1891, 1, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 20, 1599, 2353, 47, 44, 85, 149, 656, 21, 72, 181, 702, 1318, 1, 2020, 4, 3, 157, 394, 162, 50, 1085, 4, 46906, 7, 5, 286, 4, 734, 54, 208, 1085, 5, 35, 5998, 1885, 315, 4056, 655, 2092, 1488, 7070, 15, 5095, 2092, 1488, 17047, 1599, 59, 1375, 2, 1132, 6, 3478, 8, 1352, 10408, 45, 266, 3, 65, 10, 383, 6, 7, 5, 286, 2194, 2, 286, 1275, 4, 157, 15, 419, 236, 734, 54, 208, 1085, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 6, 1967, 9, 191, 1043, 21, 72, 3, 207, 1, 162, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 4, 3, 157, 394, 162, 539, 497, 9, 541, 54, 103, 3246, 1933, 3, 52, 98, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 4, 3, 157, 394, 162, 10, 212, 162, 9, 226, 4056, 2190, 667, 162, 9, 1627, 4056, 2190, 2, 335, 162, 9, 7070, 581, 1246, 2190, 4, 331, 65, 119, 1, 4056, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1497, 162, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 72, 5, 7070, 1246, 9, 857, 54, 103, 3246, 1933, 3, 52, 98, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 4, 157, 394, 162, 10, 653, 162, 9, 226, 4056, 2190, 614, 162, 9, 1627, 4056, 2190, 790, 162, 9, 7070, 1246, 2190, 481, 162, 9, 7070, 672, 315, 452, 31, 6368, 2190, 676, 162, 9, 17047, 1246, 2190, 2, 598, 162, 9, 17047, 6368, 2190, 4, 331, 65, 4056, 2, 17047, 1246, 2190, 42, 1497, 162, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 72, 5, 2190, 1, 127, 1599, 3375, 9, 857, 54, 103, 8, 405, 837, 6085, 477, 3, 52, 98, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 190, 3, 157, 394, 162, 10, 556, 162, 9, 226, 4056, 2190, 676, 162, 9, 1627, 4056, 2190, 842, 162, 9, 7070, 6368, 2190, 2, 842, 162, 9, 17047, 6368, 2190, 288, 6, 3, 127, 18, 271, 1699, 1, 4056, 10, 41, 5, 8, 1497, 162, 1701, 2, 1205, 1, 3, 702, 4, 1221, 1318, 1, 2020, 4, 3, 157, 394, 162, 539, 497, 4037, 20, 1599, 2353, 2, 16, 589, 9, 4056, 1085, 2190, 46, 74, 377, 2670, 237, 3, 3069, 1891, 1, 7, 54, 1251, 1085, 5, 46, 747, 1599, 3375]",2286.0,25064747,Hospital length stay 100 days allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation acute leukemia remission comparison alternative graft sources,4,0.004371584699453552
Polymorphisms of the vincristine pathway and response to treatment in children with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,2014-06-01,"Vincristine (VCR) is a standard component in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). VCR cytotoxicity is primarily due to its ability to disrupt the formation of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Seventeen polymorphisms in regulatory and coding regions of genes controlling VCR targets (TUBB1, MAP4, ACTG1 and CAPG) or potentially influencing VCR levels (ABCB1 and CYP3A5) were investigated for an association with peripheral neuropathy and outcome in childhood ALL patients. High-grade neurotoxicity was more frequent in carriers of the A allele of synonymous (Ala310) G to A (rs1135989) variation in the ACTG1 gene. Substitution (rs4728709) in the promoter of the ABCB1 gene had a protective effect against lower grade neurotoxicity and C to A variation (rs3770102) located 17 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site had a protective effect against high-grade neurotoxicity. Patients with the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had lower event-free survival; the association with event-free survival was not supported by the analysis in the replication patient set. The polymorphisms in the ACTG1, CAPG and ABCB1 genes may modulate VCR-related neurotoxicity, whereas the risk of relapse seems not to be affected by the genes of the VCR pathway.",Journal Article,2060.0,31.0,Vincristine VCR standard component treatment childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia VCR cytotoxicity primarily ability disrupt formation microtubules mitotic spindle Seventeen polymorphisms regulatory coding regions controlling VCR targets TUBB1 MAP4 ACTG1 CAPG potentially influencing VCR levels ABCB1 CYP3A5 investigated association peripheral neuropathy outcome childhood patients High-grade neurotoxicity frequent carriers allele synonymous Ala310 G rs1135989 variation ACTG1 Substitution rs4728709 promoter ABCB1 protective effect lower grade neurotoxicity C variation rs3770102 located 17 nucleotides upstream transcription start site protective effect high-grade neurotoxicity Patients ABCB1 3435TT genotype lower event-free survival association event-free survival supported replication patient set polymorphisms ACTG1 CAPG ABCB1 modulate VCR-related neurotoxicity risk relapse affected VCR pathway,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2132, 8886, 16, 8, 260, 1249, 4, 3, 24, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 8886, 1408, 16, 1561, 520, 6, 211, 801, 6, 6619, 3, 1264, 1, 9870, 1, 3, 2346, 4052, 3591, 1203, 4, 1253, 2, 3097, 1374, 1, 214, 1893, 8886, 637, 64695, 35860, 40795, 2, 32075, 15, 751, 4743, 8886, 148, 6560, 2, 10071, 11, 565, 9, 35, 248, 5, 672, 1751, 2, 228, 4, 864, 62, 7, 64, 88, 3561, 10, 80, 908, 4, 1316, 1, 3, 8, 1254, 1, 9287, 64696, 499, 6, 8, 64697, 1380, 4, 3, 40795, 145, 5029, 64698, 4, 3, 973, 1, 3, 6560, 145, 42, 8, 2864, 254, 480, 280, 88, 3561, 2, 256, 6, 8, 1380, 64699, 2308, 269, 11381, 3988, 29, 3, 866, 2435, 606, 42, 8, 2864, 254, 480, 64, 88, 3561, 7, 5, 3, 6560, 64700, 1183, 42, 280, 774, 115, 25, 3, 248, 5, 774, 115, 25, 10, 44, 2708, 20, 3, 65, 4, 3, 2079, 69, 916, 3, 1203, 4, 3, 40795, 32075, 2, 6560, 214, 68, 3319, 8886, 139, 3561, 547, 3, 43, 1, 429, 2744, 44, 6, 40, 1424, 20, 3, 214, 1, 3, 8886, 308]",1237.0,25084203,Polymorphisms vincristine pathway response treatment children childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,137,0.14972677595628414

Inhibition of leukemia cell engraftment and disease progression in mice by osteoblasts.,Blood,Blood,2014-08-18,"The bone marrow niche is thought to act as a permissive microenvironment required for emergence or progression of hematologic cancers. We hypothesized that osteoblasts, components of the niche involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, influence the fate of leukemic blasts. We show that osteoblast numbers decrease by 55% in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia patients. Further, genetic depletion of osteoblasts in mouse models of acute leukemia increased circulating blasts and tumor engraftment in the marrow and spleen leading to higher tumor burden and shorter survival. Myelopoiesis increased and was coupled with a reduction in B lymphopoiesis and compromised erythropoiesis, suggesting that hematopoietic lineage/progression was altered. Treatment of mice with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia with a pharmacologic inhibitor of the synthesis of duodenal serotonin, a hormone suppressing osteoblast numbers, inhibited loss of osteoblasts. Maintenance of the osteoblast pool restored normal marrow function, reduced tumor burden, and prolonged survival. Leukemia prevention was attributable to maintenance of osteoblast numbers because inhibition of serotonin receptors alone in leukemic blasts did not affect leukemia progression. These results suggest that osteoblasts play a fundamental role in propagating leukemia in the marrow and may be a therapeutic target to induce hostility of the niche to leukemia blasts.",Journal Article,1982.0,56.0,bone marrow niche thought act permissive microenvironment required emergence progression hematologic hypothesized osteoblasts components niche involved hematopoietic stem HSC function influence fate leukemic blasts osteoblast numbers decrease 55 myelodysplasia acute myeloid leukemia patients genetic depletion osteoblasts mouse models acute leukemia increased circulating blasts engraftment marrow spleen leading higher burden shorter survival Myelopoiesis increased coupled reduction B lymphopoiesis compromised erythropoiesis suggesting hematopoietic lineage/progression altered Treatment mice acute myeloid lymphoblastic leukemia pharmacologic inhibitor synthesis duodenal serotonin hormone suppressing osteoblast numbers inhibited loss osteoblasts Maintenance osteoblast pool restored normal marrow function reduced burden prolonged survival Leukemia prevention attributable maintenance osteoblast numbers inhibition serotonin receptors leukemic blasts affect leukemia progression suggest osteoblasts play fundamental role propagating leukemia marrow therapeutic target induce hostility niche leukemia blasts,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 581, 4385, 16, 2739, 6, 2559, 22, 8, 11080, 995, 616, 9, 3397, 15, 91, 1, 813, 163, 21, 1237, 17, 5965, 1628, 1, 3, 4385, 646, 4, 1007, 452, 31, 5596, 343, 1054, 3, 7878, 1, 2015, 2438, 21, 514, 17, 7418, 1870, 775, 20, 614, 4, 6128, 2, 286, 533, 7, 195, 336, 2286, 1, 5965, 4, 830, 274, 1, 286, 101, 1033, 2438, 2, 30, 2881, 4, 3, 581, 2, 4071, 1049, 6, 142, 30, 892, 2, 985, 25, 23233, 101, 2, 10, 3332, 5, 8, 628, 4, 132, 30689, 2, 4867, 10297, 802, 17, 1007, 2542, 91, 10, 1495, 24, 1, 399, 5, 286, 533, 15, 1275, 5, 8, 2788, 230, 1, 3, 2525, 1, 4748, 8306, 8, 785, 4669, 7418, 1870, 879, 407, 1, 5965, 1146, 1, 3, 7418, 6545, 4138, 295, 581, 343, 405, 30, 892, 2, 1069, 25, 1070, 10, 2971, 6, 1146, 1, 7418, 1870, 408, 297, 1, 8306, 1186, 279, 4, 2015, 2438, 205, 44, 1158, 91, 46, 99, 309, 17, 5965, 1343, 8, 4595, 200, 4, 14999, 4, 3, 581, 2, 68, 40, 8, 189, 283, 6, 1290, 39440, 1, 3, 4385, 6, 2438]",1358.0,25139351,Inhibition leukemia engraftment disease progression mice osteoblasts,0,0.0
Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch increases mortality after myeloablative unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2014-08-26,"We examined current outcomes of unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to determine the clinical implications of donor-recipient HLA matching. Adult and pediatric patients who had first undergone myeloablative-unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome between 1999 and 2011 were included. All had high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Of the total (n = 8003), cases were 8/8 (n = 5449), 7/8 (n = 2071), or 6/8 (n = 483) matched. HLA mismatch (6-7/8) conferred significantly increased risk for grades II to IV and III to IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall mortality compared with HLA-matched cases (8/8). Type (allele/antigen) and locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1) of mismatch were not associated with overall mortality. Among 8/8 matched cases, HLA-DPB1 and -DQB1 mismatch resulted in increased acute GVHD, and HLA-DPB1 mismatch had decreased relapse.

Targetable kinase-activating lesions in Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2014-09-01,"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is characterized by a gene-expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, alterations of lymphoid transcription factor genes, and a poor outcome. The frequency and spectrum of genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL and its responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibition are undefined, especially in adolescents and adults. We performed genomic profiling of 1725 patients with precursor B-cell ALL and detailed genomic analysis of 154 patients with Ph-like ALL. We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL. Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 91% of patients with Ph-like ALL; rearrangements involving ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B, TSLP, or TYK2 and sequence mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, or SH2B3 were most common. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib. Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL are needed to assess whether adding tyrosine kinase inhibitors to current therapy will improve the survival of patients with this type of leukemia.

Utility of the N-back task in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,2014-09-25,"The N-back task is often used in functional brain imaging studies to activate working memory networks; however, limited information is available on its association to clinical outcomes in children or cancer survivors. A total of 137 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; mean current age = 14.3 years, SD = 4.8; time since diagnosis = 7.6 years, SD = 1.6) completed the N-back task and comprehensive neurocognitive testing, including standardized measures of attention, processing speed, and working memory. Results indicated that females demonstrated significantly slower reaction times (0-back p = .02; 1-back p = .03) than males. Survivors <15 years old at the time of testing demonstrated a significant decrease in accuracy as working memory load increased compared to survivors ≥15 years old (p < .001). Performance on the N-back task was associated with nonverbal working memory (rs = .56, p < .001) in survivors ≥15 years of age. For younger survivors, N-back performance was more strongly associated with attention skills. Results suggest the N-back assesses different cognitive constructs at younger compared to older childhood ages.

NK cell genotype and phenotype at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia correlate with postinduction residual disease.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-10-03,"Not all natural killer (NK) cells are equally cytotoxic against leukemia because of differences in receptor gene content and surface expression. We correlated NK cell genotype and phenotype at diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction chemotherapy. The NK cells and leukemia blasts of 244 patients were analyzed at diagnosis by killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) typing and immunophenotyping. The results were correlated statistically with postinduction MRD status. The odds of being MRD positive in patients with KIR telomeric (Tel)-A/B genotype were 2.85 times the odds in those with Tel-A/A genotype (P = 0.035). MRD-positive patients were more likely to have KIR2DL5A (P = 0.006) and expressed less activating receptor NKp46 and FASL on their NK cells (P = 0.0074 and P = 0.029, respectively). The odds of being MRD positive increased by 2.01-fold for every percentage increase in NK cells expressing KIR2DL1 in the presence of HLA-C2 ligand (P = 0.034). The quantity of granzyme B inhibitor PI-9 in the leukemia blasts was greater in patients who were MRD positive (P = 0.038). Collectively, five NK cell-related factors (Tel-B-associated KIR2DL5A, NKp46, FASL, granzyme B, and PI-9) are strongly associated with MRD positivity at the end of induction with 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity.

Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia after multiple myeloma in the era of novel agents.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2014-11-03,"Survival for patients with multiple myeloma has increased. Both melphalan and lenalidomide are associated with subsequent development of myelodysplasia. We reviewed the cases of all patients with multiple myeloma who had subsequent development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) during a 12-year period in three centers. Of 55 patients identified, two received only lenalidomide before myelodysplasia developed. The median time between the diagnoses of multiple myeloma and MDS/ANLL was 52.7 months. Median survival after the diagnosis of MDS or ANLL was 6.7 months.

"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: update on molecular biology, diagnosis, and therapy.",Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,2014-10-01,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare hematological malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. Most patients with BPDCN have skin lesions and simultaneous involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. A search of PubMed and Medline was conducted for English-written articles relating to BPDCN, CD4(+)CD56(+) hematodermic neoplasm, and blastic natural killer cell lymphoma. Data regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment were analyzed. BPDCN is derived from precursor plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The diagnosis of BPDCN is based on the characteristic cytology and immunophenotype of malignant cells coexpressing CD4, CD56, CD123, blood dendritic cell antigens 2 and 4, and CD2AP markers. Multiple chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations previously reported in patients with myeloid and selected lymphoid neoplasms were identified in approximately 60% of patients with BPDCN. Prospectively controlled studies to guide treatment decisions are lacking. The overall response rate with aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type induction regimens was as high as 90%, but the durability of response was short. Median survival rates ranged between 12 and 16 months. Patients with relapsed disease may respond to L-asparaginase-containing regimens. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, particularly when performed during the first remission, may produce durable remissions in selected adults. BPDCN is a rare aggressive disease that typically affects elderly patients. The most commonly affected nonhematopoietic organ is the skin. Although BPDCN is initially sensitive to conventional chemotherapy regimens, this response is relatively short and long-term prognosis is poor.

Regional brain glucose metabolism and neurocognitive function in adult survivors of childhood cancer treated with cranial radiation.,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",J. Nucl. Med.,2014-10-14,"The objective of this study was to examine associations between regional brain metabolism, as measured by (18)F-FDG PET, and neurocognitive outcomes in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with cranial radiation. Thirty-eight adult survivors of ALL were randomly selected from a large cohort treated with cranial radiation therapy (19 with 18 Gy and 19 with 24 Gy of exposure). At a mean age of 26.4 (range, 22.3-37.4) years, and 23.5 (range, 20.4-32.8) years since diagnosis, patients underwent comprehensive neurocognitive evaluations and brain (18)F-FDG PET imaging during a resting condition. (18)F-FDG PET images were analyzed stereotactically, and pixel values were normalized to global activity. Predefined region-of-interest and voxel-based correlation analyses were performed. Compared with national norms, survivors demonstrated lower vocabulary (P < 0.001), reading (P < 0.001), mathematics (P < 0.001), working memory (P < 0.001), oral naming speed (P < 0.001), and cognitive flexibility (P < 0.001). Metabolic activity was higher in basal gangliar structures for those treated with 24 Gy of cranial radiation therapy (P = 0.04). Metabolic activity was positively correlated with oral naming speed in both lateral frontal lobes (ρ = 0.48 and 0.47 for right and left frontal regions, respectively, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with cognitive flexibility in the sections of the basal ganglia (P < 0.01 for both caudate and putamen).

We conducted a retrospective study of 209 consecutive adult patients transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 138), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 28), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 43) using PTCy as sole GVHD prophylaxis after myeloablative conditioning and HLA-matched-related or -unrelated T-cell-replete allografting. At alloBMT, 30% of patients were not in morphologic complete remission. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III to IV acute GVHD at 100 days and chronic GVHD at 2 years were 45%, 11%, and 13%, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients did not require immunosuppression for any reason beyond PTCy. At 3 years, relapse cumulative incidence was 36%, disease-free survival was 46%, survival free of disease and chronic GVHD was 39%, and overall survival was 58%. Lack of remission at alloBMT, adverse cytogenetics, and low allograft nucleated cell dose were associated with inferior survival for AML patients. Minimal residual disease but not t(9;22) was associated with inferior outcomes for ALL patients.

Combination therapy with nilotinib for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant BCR-ABL-positive leukemia and other malignancies.,Archives of toxicology,Arch. Toxicol.,2014-10-21,"Despite the clinical efficacy achieved with frontline therapies for BCR-ABL-positive disease, such as imatinib and second-generation ABL inhibitors like nilotinib or dasatinib that were originally designed to override insensitivity to imatinib, drug resistance still remains a challenge, especially for patients with advanced-stage chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The discovery of BCR-ABL point mutations has been a great asset to furthering our understanding of a major cause of drug resistance, as has discovery of multidrug resistance proteins, dysregulation of signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, and insights into the underlying causes of stromal-mediated chemoresistance.

Structure-guided development of deoxycytidine kinase inhibitors with nanomolar affinity and improved metabolic stability.,Journal of medicinal chemistry,J. Med. Chem.,2014-11-07,"Recently, we have shown that small molecule dCK inhibitors in combination with pharmacological perturbations of de novo dNTP biosynthetic pathways could eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in animal models. However, our previous lead compound had a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we set out to develop dCK inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We delineated the sites of the inhibitor for modification, guided by crystal structures of dCK in complex with the lead compound and with derivatives. Crystal structure of the complex between dCK and the racemic mixture of our new lead compound indicated that the R-isomer is responsible for kinase inhibition. This was corroborated by kinetic analysis of the purified enantiomers, which showed that the R-isomer has >60-fold higher affinity than the S-isomer for dCK. This new lead compound has significantly improved metabolic stability, making it a prime candidate for dCK-inhibitor based therapies against hematological malignancies and, potentially, other cancers.

Sixty-one patients diagnosed with MPAL using either European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukaemias (EGIL) criteria or 2008 WHO criteria were included in this study. Sixteen patients (26%) diagnosed with acute biphenotypic leukemia using EGIL criteria did not fulfill 2008 WHO criteria for MPAL. Cytogenetic data were available for 32 patients, and the most common abnormality was t(9;22) (five of 32 cases). Clinical outcome data suggested that younger patients with MPAL (≤21 years) had better overall survival (OS) in both the EGIL and WHO groups (EGIL, P = .0403; WHO, P = .0601). Compared with 177 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MPAL patients had better OS (P = .0003) and progression-free survival (P = .0001). However, no difference in OS between MPAL and 387 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was present (P = .599).

Oncogene regulation. An oncogenic super-enhancer formed through somatic mutation of a noncoding intergenic element.,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Science,2014-11-13,"In certain human cancers, the expression of critical oncogenes is driven from large regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, that recruit much of the cell's transcriptional apparatus and are defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac). In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation. Thus, this study identifies a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of oncogenic super-enhancers in malignant cells.

Decreased induction morbidity and mortality following modification to induction therapy in infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled on AALL0631: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-11-18,"Infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a poor prognosis. Intensification of therapy has resulted in fewer relapses but increased early deaths, resulting in failure to improve survival. AALL0631 is a Phase 3 study for infants (<366 days of age) with newly diagnosed ALL. Induction initially (Cohort 1) consisted of 3 weeks of therapy based on COG P9407. Due to excessive early mortality, induction was amended to a less intensive 5 weeks of therapy based on Interfant-99. Additionally, enhanced supportive care guidelines were incorporated with hospitalization during induction until evidence of marrow recovery and recommendations for prevention/treatment of infections (Cohort 2). Induction mortality was significantly lower for patients in Cohort 2 (2/123, 1.6%) versus Cohort 1 (4/26, 15.4%; P = 0.009). All induction deaths were infection related except one due to progressive disease (Cohort 2). Sterile site infections were lower for patients in Cohort 2 (24/123, 19.5%) versus Cohort 1 (15/26, 57.7%; P = 0.0002), with a significantly lower rate of Gram positive infections during induction for patients in Cohort 2, P = 0.0002.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to comprehensively identify inherited genetic variants associated with susceptibility to AYA ALL. In the discovery GWAS, we compared genotype frequency at 635 297 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 308 AYA ALL cases and 6,661 non-ALL controls by using a logistic regression model with genetic ancestry as a covariate. SNPs that reached P ≤ 5 × 10(-8) in GWAS were tested in an independent cohort of 162 AYA ALL cases and 5,755 non-ALL controls. We identified a single genome-wide significant susceptibility locus in GATA3: rs3824662, odds ratio (OR), 1.77 (P = 2.8 × 10(-10)) and rs3781093, OR, 1.73 (P = 3.2 × 10(-9)). These findings were validated in the replication cohort. The risk allele at rs3824662 was most frequent in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like ALL but also conferred susceptibility to non-Ph-like ALL in AYAs. In 1,827 non-selected ALL cases, the risk allele frequency at this SNP was positively correlated with age at diagnosis (P = 6.29 × 10(-11)).

mTOR kinase inhibitors synergize with histone deacetylase inhibitors to kill B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2015-02-01,"High activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is associated with poor prognosis in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), suggesting that inhibiting mTOR might be clinically useful. However, emerging data indicate that mTOR inhibitors are most effective when combined with other target agents. One strategy is to combine with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, since B-ALL is often characterized by epigenetic changes that silence the expression of pro-apoptotic factors. Here we tested combinations of mTOR and pan-HDAC inhibitors on B-ALL cells, including both Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and non-Ph cell lines. We found that mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) synergize with HDAC inhibitors to cause apoptosis in B-ALL cells and the effect is greater when compared to rapamycin plus HDAC inhibitors. The combination of TOR-KIs with the clinically approved HDAC inhibitor vorinostat increased apoptosis in primary pediatric B-ALL cells in vitro.

Enhancing antitumor efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells through constitutive CD40L expression.,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,Mol. Ther.,2015-01-13,"Adoptive cell therapy with genetically modified T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a promising therapy for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, CAR-modified T cells (CAR T cells) have mostly failed in patients with solid tumors or low-grade B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia with bulky lymph node involvement. Herein, we enhance the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells through the constitutive expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154). T cells genetically modified to constitutively express CD40L (CD40L-modified T cells) demonstrated increased proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory TH1 cytokines. Further, CD40L-modified T cells augmented the immunogenicity of CD40(+) tumor cells by the upregulated surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), adhesion molecules (CD54, CD58, and CD70), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules (Class I and HLA-DR), and the Fas-death receptor (CD95). Additionally, CD40L-modified T cells induced maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Finally, tumor-targeted CD19-specific CAR/CD40L T cells exhibited increased cytotoxicity against CD40(+) tumors and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a xenotransplant model of CD19(+) systemic lymphoma. This preclinical data supports the clinical application of CAR T cells additionally modified to constitutively express CD40L with anticipated enhanced antitumor efficacy.

How I treat mixed-phenotype acute leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-01-20,"Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) encompasses a heterogeneous group of rare leukemias in which assigning a single lineage of origin is not possible. A variety of different terms and classification systems have been used historically to describe this entity. MPAL is currently defined by a limited set of lineage-specific markers proposed in the 2008 World Health Organization monograph on classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. In adult patients, MPAL is characterized by relative therapeutic resistance that may be attributed in part to the high proportion of patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. No prospective, controlled trials exist to guide therapy. The limited available data suggest that an ""acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like"" regimen followed by allogeneic stem-cell transplant may be advisable; addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with t(9;22) translocation is recommended.

Utility of early screening magnetic resonance imaging for extensive hip osteonecrosis in pediatric patients treated with glucocorticoids.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-01-20,"Hip osteonecrosis frequently complicates treatment with glucocorticoids.

This prospective cohort magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening study included all consecutive children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on a single protocol. Hip MRI was performed at 6.5 and 9 months from diagnosis (early screening) and at completion of chemotherapy (final evaluation) to determine whether screening could identify extensive hip osteonecrosis before symptom development. Of 498 patients, 462 underwent screening MRI. Extensive asymptomatic osteonecrosis was identified by early screening in 26 patients (41 hips); another four patients (seven hips) were detected after the screening period, such that screening sensitivity was 84.1% and specificity was 99.4%. The number of joints screened to detect one lesion was 20.1 joints for all patients, 4.4 joints for patients older than 10 years, and 198 joints for patients ≤ 10 years old (P < .001). Of the 40 extensive lesions in patients older than 10 years, 19 required total hip arthroplasty and none improved. Of eight extensive lesions in younger patients, none required arthroplasty and four improved. In patients age 10 years old or younger who require prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, screening for extensive hip osteonecrosis is unnecessary because their risk is low and lesions tend to heal.

Overall survival in this group remains a relatively poor 20-40%. Modern research has focused on improved pharmacokinetics, novel pharmacogenetics and personalized principles to optimize the efficacy of the treatment while reducing toxicity. Here we review the pharmacogenetics of medications used in the management of patients with ALL, including l-asparaginase, glucocorticoids, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, vincristine and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Inherited NUDT15 variant is a genetic determinant of mercaptopurine intolerance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-01-26,"Mercaptopurine (MP) is the mainstay of curative therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify comprehensively the genetic basis of MP intolerance in children with ALL. The discovery GWAS and replication cohorts included 657 and 371 children from two prospective clinical trials. MP dose intensity was a marker for drug tolerance and toxicities and was defined as prescribed dose divided by the planned protocol dose during maintenance therapy; its association with genotype was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model. MP dose intensity varied by race and ethnicity and was negatively correlated with East Asian genetic ancestry (P < .001). The GWAS revealed two genome-wide significant loci associated with dose intensity: rs1142345 in TPMT (Tyr240Cys, present in *3A and *3C variants; P = 8.6 × 10(-9)) and rs116855232 in NUDT15 (P = 8.8 × 10(-9)), with independent replication. Patients with TT genotype at rs116855232 were exquisitely sensitive to MP, with an average dose intensity of 8.3%, compared with those with TC and CC genotypes, who tolerated 63% and 83.5% of the planned dose, respectively.

Myelopathy following intrathecal chemotherapy in adults: a single institution experience.,Journal of neuro-oncology,J. Neurooncol.,2015-02-10,"Methotrexate and cytarabine arabinoside are frequently administered intrathecally in the prophylaxis and treatment of patients with hematological malignancies. Myelopathy as a complication of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is rare in adults, with most of the cases described in the literature occurring in the pediatric population. Between January 2010 and March 2014, 587 newly diagnosed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 24 chronic myeloid leukemia lymphoid blast phase patients were seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This case series discusses seven adult cases deemed to have IT chemotherapy-induced myelopathy between 2010 and 2014 at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Five out of the seven patients had T2 abnormalities involving the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. An elevated myelin basic protein level was noted in the two patients in whom it was checked. The wide range of dosage and timing with respect to IT chemotherapy administration suggests an idiosyncratic reaction or individual threshold to the development of myelopathy. By describing the largest case series of myelopathy in adults, we aim to raise awareness about this rare albeit devastating complication. Based on the seven cases described we would recommend-MRI of the spine with T2-weighted imaging in the sagittal and axial planes in leukemia patients with unexplained myelopathy and consideration to delay IT chemotherapy until after an extensive work-up to rule out CNS leukemia.

Using gene therapy to manipulate the immune system in the fight against B-cell leukemias.,Expert opinion on biological therapy,Expert Opin Biol Ther,2015-02-09,"Over 20 years ago, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were created to endow T cells with new antigen-specificity and create a therapy that could eradicate cancer and provide life-long protection against recurrence. Steady progress has led to significant improvements with CAR design and CAR T-cell production, allowing evaluation of CAR T cells in patients. The initial trials have targeted CD19, which is expressed on normal and malignant B cells. We review data from trials for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In addition, we discuss the on-target toxicities, B-cell aplasia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is uniquely associated with T-cell immunotherapies. We compare the results when targeting the same antigen in CLL or B-ALL and speculate on reasons for outcome differences and future directions to enhance outcomes. Furthermore, the dramatic results targeting B-ALL require further analysis in Phase II trials, and we discuss important components of these future trials. We also suggest a management scheme for CRS. The next several years will be critical and may lead to the first clinical indication of a gene-engineered cell therapy for cancer.",Journal Article,1807.0,5.0,20 years ago chimeric antigen receptors CARs created endow new antigen-specificity create therapy eradicate provide life-long protection recurrence Steady progress led significant improvements CAR design CAR T-cell production allowing evaluation CAR patients initial trials targeted CD19 expressed normal malignant B review trials patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL addition discuss on-target toxicities B-cell aplasia cytokine release syndrome CRS uniquely associated T-cell immunotherapies compare targeting antigen CLL B-ALL speculate reasons outcome differences future directions enhance outcomes Furthermore dramatic targeting B-ALL require Phase II trials discuss important components future trials suggest management scheme CRS years critical lead clinical indication gene-engineered therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[252, 179, 60, 5028, 2897, 448, 1186, 7441, 11, 2466, 6, 20817, 102, 37, 5, 217, 448, 1121, 2, 3736, 8, 36, 17, 359, 5650, 12, 2, 377, 358, 319, 3525, 480, 146, 4152, 1466, 71, 836, 6, 93, 1474, 5, 1881, 771, 2, 1881, 102, 31, 1529, 2952, 451, 1, 1881, 102, 37, 4, 7, 3, 388, 143, 47, 238, 3158, 92, 16, 570, 23, 295, 2, 393, 132, 37, 21, 206, 74, 29, 143, 9, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 2, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 4, 352, 21, 1139, 3, 23, 283, 385, 132, 31, 12307, 2, 1675, 2008, 681, 3115, 92, 16, 7089, 41, 5, 102, 31, 2811, 21, 932, 3, 99, 198, 529, 3, 827, 448, 4, 552, 15, 132, 62, 2, 11778, 23, 2325, 9, 228, 362, 2, 508, 3540, 6, 1304, 123, 798, 3, 3079, 99, 529, 132, 62, 1353, 195, 65, 4, 124, 215, 143, 2, 21, 1139, 305, 1628, 1, 46, 508, 143, 21, 120, 309, 8, 284, 4633, 9, 3115, 3, 1305, 392, 60, 303, 40, 740, 2, 68, 1122, 6, 3, 157, 38, 3607, 1, 8, 145, 2794, 31, 36, 9, 12]",1188.0,25666545,therapy manipulate immune fight B-cell leukemias,3,0.003278688524590164
Final report of a phase II study of imatinib mesylate with hyper-CVAD for the front-line treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2015-02-14,"We have previously reported on the efficacy and tolerability of hyper-CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone) and imatinib followed by imatinib-based consolidation/maintenance therapy in 20 patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we present the 13-year follow up of our study. Fifty-four patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia were enrolled: 39 (72%) with de novo disease, 6 (11%) whose disease was primary refractory after induction (without a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and 9 (17%) in complete remission after one course of induction therapy (without tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Forty-two (93%) of the 45 patients treated for active disease achieved complete remission, one achieved complete remission with incomplete recovery of platelets, one achieved partial remission and one died during induction. Nineteen (35%) patients are alive and 18 are in complete remission. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 43%. Significant negative predictors of overall survival were age over 60 years, p190 molecular transcript, and active disease at enrollment. Sixteen (30%) patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median overall survival was not significantly greater for patients who underwent transplant. Patients with residual molecular disease at three months had improved complete remission duration with transplant. The median time to hematologic recovery and severe toxicities with combination were not significantly different from those observed with conventional chemotherapy. Only one patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity. HyperCVAD chemotherapy and imatinib is an effective regimen for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Phase I/II study of the hypoxia-activated prodrug PR104 in refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2015-02-14,"We previously demonstrated vast expansion of hypoxic areas in the leukemic microenvironment and provided a rationale for using hypoxia-activated prodrugs. PR104 is a phosphate ester that is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding alcohol PR-104A and further reduced to the amine and hydroxyl-amine nitrogen mustards that induce DNA cross-linking in hypoxic cells under low oxygen concentrations. In this phase I/II study, patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (n=40) after 1 or 2 prior treatments or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=10) after any number of prior treatments received PR104; dose ranged from 1.1 to 4 g/m(2). The most common treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were myelosuppression (anemia 62%, neutropenia 50%, thrombocytopenia 46%), febrile neutropenia (40%), infection (24%), and enterocolitis (14%). Ten of 31 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (32%) and 2 of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20%) who received 3 g/m(2) or 4 g/m(2) had a response (complete response, n=1; complete response without platelet recovery, n=5; morphological leukemia-free state, n=6). The extent of hypoxia was evaluated by the hypoxia tracer pimonidazole administered prior to a bone marrow biopsy and by immunohistochemical assessments of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha and carbonic anhydrase IX. A high fraction of leukemic cells expressed these markers, and PR104 administration resulted in measurable decrease of the proportions of hypoxic cells.

Balancing cure and long-term risks in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2014-11-18,"Cure rates for children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically over the last few decades. With this success has come increasing recognition of the adverse late effects of treatment. The significant long-term sequelae in the earliest cohort of long-term survivors treated in the 1970s and 1980s are well documented. To reduce the incidence of these late effects, the majority of pediatric patients treated on more contemporary regimens receive less intensive treatment than did those treated 30-40 years ago. However, current therapies are not risk free; children treated with contemporary regimens remain at risk for developing long-term toxicities, including cardiac dysfunction, osteonecrosis, neurocognitive impairment, and second malignant neoplasms. One of the great challenges facing clinical investigators today is to identify interventions that will reduce the frequency and severity of long-term toxicities without adversely affecting cure rates. The use of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant (to prevent anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity) and alternate-week dosing of dexamethasone (to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis) are examples of 2 such successful strategies. This article provides an overview of the long-term toxicities associated with current therapies and reviews results of clinical trials designed to minimize the burden of cure in long-term survivors.

Association of an inherited genetic variant with vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,JAMA,JAMA,2015-02-01,"With cure rates of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeding 85%, there is a need to mitigate treatment toxicities that can compromise quality of life, including peripheral neuropathy from vincristine treatment. To identify genetic germline variants associated with the occurrence or severity of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in children with ALL. Genome-wide association study of patients in 1 of 2 prospective clinical trials for childhood ALL that included treatment with 36 to 39 doses of vincristine. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy were assessed in 321 patients from whom DNA was available: 222 patients (median age, 6.0 years; range, 0.1-18.8 years) enrolled in 1994-1998 in the St Jude Children's Research Hospital protocol Total XIIIB with toxic effects follow-up through January 2001, and 99 patients (median age, 11.4 years; range, 3.0-23.8 years) enrolled in 2007-2010 in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL0433 with toxic effects follow-up through May 2011. Human leukemia cells and induced pluripotent stem cell neurons were used to assess the effects of lower CEP72 expression on vincristine sensitivity. Treatment with vincristine at a dose of 1.5 or 2.0 mg/m2. Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy was assessed at clinic visits using National Cancer Institute criteria and prospectively graded as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), serious/disabling (grade 3), or life threatening (grade 4). Grade 2 to 4 vincristine-induced neuropathy during continuation therapy occurred in 28.8% of patients (64/222) in the St Jude cohort and in 22.2% (22/99) in the COG cohort. A SNP in the promoter region of the CEP72 gene, which encodes a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule formation, had a significant association with vincristine neuropathy (meta-analysis P = 6.3×10(-9)). This SNP had a minor allele frequency of 37% (235/642), with 50 of 321 patients (16%; 95% CI, 11.6%-19.5%) homozygous for the risk allele (TT at rs924607). Among patients with the high-risk CEP72 genotype (TT at rs924607), 28 of 50 (56%; 95% CI, 41.2%-70.0%) developed at least 1 episode of grade 2 to 4 neuropathy, a higher rate than in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotypes (58/271 patients [21.4%; 95% CI, 16.9%-26.7%]; P = 2.4×10(-6)). The severity of neuropathy was greater in patients homozygous for the TT genotype compared with patients with the CC or CT genotype (2.4-fold by Poisson regression [P<.0001] and 2.7-fold based on mean grade of neuropathy: 1.23 [95% CI, 0.74-1.72] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.3-0.6]; P = .004 by t test). Reducing CEP72 expression in human neurons and leukemia cells increased their sensitivity to vincristine. In this preliminary study of children with ALL, an inherited polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 was associated with increased risk and severity of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. If replicated in additional populations, this finding may provide a basis for safer dosing of this widely prescribed anticancer agent.",Journal Article,1815.0,103.0,cure rates childhood acute

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce mesenchymal stem cell-mediated resistance in BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-02-23,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are used as a frontline therapy for BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, resistance to TKI therapy arises rapidly, and its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel cascade of events initiated by TKIs and traversing through mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to leukemic cells, leading to resistance. MSCs exposed to TKIs acquired a new functional status with the expression of genes encoding for chemo-attractants, adhesion molecules, and prosurvival growth factors, and this priming enabled leukemic cells to form clusters underneath the MSCs. This cluster formation was associated with the protection of ALL cells from therapy as leukemic cells switched from BCR-ABL signaling to IL-7R/Janus kinase signaling to survive in the MSC milieu. Our findings illustrate a novel perspective in the evolution of TKI resistance and provide insights for advancing the treatment of BCR-ABL(+) ALL.

A Phase I/II Study of the mTOR Inhibitor Everolimus in Combination with HyperCVAD Chemotherapy in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-02-27,"Previous studies suggest a potential therapeutic role for mTOR inhibition in lymphoid malignancies. This single-center phase I/II study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with HyperCVAD chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Twenty-four patients were treated; 15 received everolimus 5 mg/day and 9 received 10 mg/day with HyperCVAD. The median age of patients was 25 years (range, 11-64) and median number of prior treatments was 2 (range, 1-7). Grade 3 mucositis was the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated everolimus dose was 5 mg/day. Responses included complete remission (CR) in 6 patients (25%), CR without platelet recovery (CRp) in 1 (4%), and CR without recovery of counts (CRi) in 1 (4%), for an overall response rate of 33%. In addition, partial response (PR) was noted in 2 patients (8%). Seven of 11 patients treated in first salvage achieved CR/CRp (64%). The median OS was 29 weeks for patients in first salvage versus 15 weeks for patients in second salvage and beyond (P ≤ 0.001). A response was noted in 5 of 10 (50%) heavily pretreated T-ALL patients (median of 4 prior salvage regimens). Everolimus significantly inhibited phosphorylation of S6RP, but this did not correlate with response. No significant decreases in p4EBP1 and pAkt levels were noted. Responders had higher everolimus dose-adjusted area under the curve (P = 0.025) and lower clearance (P = 0.025) than nonresponders. The combination of HyperCVAD and everolimus is well tolerated and moderately effective in relapsed ALL, specifically T-ALL.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1789.0,27.0,Previous studies suggest potential therapeutic role mTOR inhibition lymphoid malignancies single-center phase I/II designed test safety efficacy mTOR inhibitor everolimus combination HyperCVAD chemotherapy relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia Twenty-four patients treated 15 received everolimus 5 mg/day 9 received 10 mg/day HyperCVAD median age patients 25 years range 11-64 median number prior treatments 2 range 1-7 Grade 3 mucositis dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerated everolimus dose 5 mg/day Responses included complete remission CR 6 patients 25 CR platelet recovery CRp 1 4 CR recovery counts CRi 1 4 overall response rate 33 addition partial response PR noted 2 patients 8 Seven 11 patients treated salvage achieved CR/CRp 64 median OS 29 weeks patients salvage versus 15 weeks patients second salvage P ≤ 0.001 response noted 5 10 50 heavily pretreated T-ALL patients median 4 prior salvage regimens Everolimus significantly inhibited phosphorylation S6RP correlate response significant decreases p4EBP1 pAkt levels noted Responders higher everolimus dose-adjusted area curve P 0.025 lower clearance P 0.025 nonresponders combination HyperCVAD everolimus tolerated moderately effective relapsed specifically T-ALL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[698, 94, 309, 8, 174, 189, 200, 9, 873, 297, 4, 2303, 441, 26, 226, 574, 124, 70, 215, 45, 10, 1114, 6, 412, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 3, 873, 230, 1400, 4, 150, 5, 13792, 56, 4, 591, 430, 286, 1275, 62, 737, 294, 7, 11, 73, 167, 103, 1400, 33, 81, 218, 2, 83, 103, 79, 81, 218, 5, 13792, 3, 52, 89, 1, 7, 10, 243, 60, 184, 175, 660, 2, 52, 207, 1, 324, 640, 10, 18, 184, 14, 67, 88, 27, 2606, 10, 3, 61, 817, 155, 2, 3, 689, 421, 1400, 61, 10, 33, 81, 218, 253, 159, 236, 734, 684, 4, 49, 7, 243, 684, 187, 1596, 1602, 3162, 4, 14, 39, 2, 684, 187, 1602, 1, 1911, 6341, 4, 14, 39, 9, 35, 63, 51, 116, 1, 466, 4, 352, 450, 51, 998, 10, 1051, 4, 18, 7, 66, 648, 1, 175, 7, 73, 4, 157, 992, 513, 684, 3162, 660, 3, 52, 118, 10, 462, 244, 9, 7, 4, 157, 992, 185, 167, 244, 9, 7, 4, 419, 992, 2, 1654, 19, 1552, 13, 144, 8, 51, 10, 1051, 4, 33, 1, 79, 212, 2447, 2193, 102, 62, 7, 52, 1, 39, 324, 992, 472, 1400, 97, 879, 982, 1, 29010, 84, 26, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 51, 77, 93, 2140, 4, 23944, 2, 6724, 148, 11, 1051, 1983, 42, 142, 1400, 61, 586, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 19, 13, 4067, 2, 280, 1960, 19, 13, 4067, 76, 4498, 3, 150, 1, 13792, 2, 1400, 16, 149, 421, 2, 3508, 323, 4, 591, 62, 1225, 102, 62]",1555.0,25724525,Phase I/II mTOR Inhibitor Everolimus Combination HyperCVAD Chemotherapy Patients Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,0,0.0
The landscape of somatic mutations in infant MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemias.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2015-03-02,"Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with MLL rearrangements (MLL-R) represents a distinct leukemia with a poor prognosis. To define its mutational landscape, we performed whole-genome, exome, RNA and targeted DNA sequencing on 65 infants (47 MLL-R and 18 non-MLL-R cases) and 20 older children (MLL-R cases) with leukemia. Our data show that infant MLL-R ALL has one of the lowest frequencies of somatic mutations of any sequenced cancer, with the predominant leukemic clone carrying a mean of 1.3 non-silent mutations. Despite this paucity of mutations, we detected activating mutations in kinase-PI3K-RAS signaling pathway components in 47% of cases. Surprisingly, these mutations were often subclonal and were frequently lost at relapse. In contrast to infant cases, MLL-R leukemia in older children had more somatic mutations (mean of 6.5 mutations/case versus 1.3 mutations/case, P = 7.15 × 10(-5)) and had frequent mutations (45%) in epigenetic regulators, a category of genes that, with the exception of MLL, was rarely mutated in infant MLL-R ALL.

The role of ponatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Expert review of anticancer therapy,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,2015-03-12,"The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has improved outcomes in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, yet relapse due to the development of resistance mutations remains a major obstacle. Ponatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to overcome single-resistance mutations in the ABL kinase. Three clinical trials confirmed the efficacy of ponatinib in the relapsed and front-line setting in Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, even in the presence of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The rate of relapse appears to be very low when used in combination with chemotherapy, suggesting a role for ponatinib in newly diagnosed patients. A major concern with the use of ponatinib is the associated high risk of life-threatening vascular thrombotic events. Potential strategies to reduce this risk include minimizing the use of ponatinib in patients with significant baseline cardiovascular risk, careful surveillance and treatment of cardiovascular risk-factors and dose reduction of ponatinib.",Journal Article,1776.0,11.0,introduction tyrosine kinase inhibitors improved outcomes Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse development resistance remains major obstacle Ponatinib novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed overcome single-resistance ABL kinase clinical trials confirmed efficacy ponatinib relapsed front-line setting Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia presence T315I confers resistance tyrosine kinase inhibitors rate relapse appears low combination chemotherapy suggesting role ponatinib newly diagnosed patients major concern use ponatinib associated high risk life-threatening vascular thrombotic events Potential strategies reduce risk include minimizing use ponatinib patients significant baseline cardiovascular risk careful surveillance treatment cardiovascular risk-factors dose reduction ponatinib,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2456, 1, 564, 216, 222, 71, 231, 123, 4, 3006, 1170, 109, 286, 1275, 1145, 429, 520, 6, 3, 193, 1, 251, 138, 469, 8, 458, 7414, 5715, 16, 8, 229, 564, 216, 230, 1114, 6, 1768, 226, 251, 138, 4, 3, 1425, 216, 169, 38, 143, 557, 3, 209, 1, 5715, 4, 3, 591, 2, 3007, 328, 546, 4, 3006, 109, 286, 1275, 871, 4, 3, 463, 1, 3, 6184, 258, 92, 4020, 251, 6, 127, 564, 216, 222, 3, 116, 1, 429, 1233, 6, 40, 923, 154, 198, 95, 4, 150, 5, 56, 802, 8, 200, 9, 5715, 4, 732, 265, 7, 8, 458, 2893, 5, 3, 119, 1, 5715, 16, 3, 41, 64, 43, 1, 358, 3691, 756, 6108, 281, 174, 422, 6, 969, 26, 43, 643, 4501, 3, 119, 1, 5715, 4, 7, 5, 93, 330, 2179, 43, 3465, 617, 2, 24, 1, 2179, 43, 130, 2, 61, 628, 1, 5715]",1068.0,25764322,role ponatinib Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia,18,0.019672131147540985
Advances in the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a case study compendium.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2014-12-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by proliferation of immature lymphoid cells throughout the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Most cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Adults have a worse prognosis than children. Approximately half of adult ALL patients relapse after their initial treatment. There is no standard treatment for ALL; strategies vary according to the patient’s age, comorbidities, and Philadelphia chromosome status. Regimens used in pediatric patients are being adapted for use in adults. Frontline management can include hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with cycles of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD) and the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster regimen. Relapsed/refractory patients have several options, including a regimen consisting of fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (FLAG); tyrosine kinase inhibitors; and chemotherapy.

How I treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia in older adolescents and young adults.,Blood,Blood,2015-03-24,"At the intersection between children and older adults, the care of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) poses unique challenges and issues beyond those faced by other age groups. Although the survival of AYA patients is inferior to younger children, growing evidence suggests that AYA patients have improved outcomes, with disease-free survival rates of 60% to 70%, when treated with pediatric-based approaches. A holistic approach, incorporating a multidisciplinary team, is a key component of successful treatment of these AYA patients. With the appropriate support and management of toxicities during and following treatment, these regimens are well tolerated in the AYA population. Even with the significant progress that has been made during the last decade, patients with persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during intensive therapy still have a poor prognosis. With new insights into disease pathogenesis in AYA ALL and the availability of disease-specific kinase inhibitors and novel targeted antibodies, future studies will focus on individualized therapy to eradicate MRD and result in further improvements in survival. This case-based review will discuss the biology, pharmacology, and psychosocial aspects of AYA patients with ALL, highlighting our current approach to the management of these unique patients.

Identification of novel therapeutic targets in acute leukemias with NRAS mutations using a pharmacologic approach.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-01,"Oncogenic forms of NRAS are frequently associated with hematologic malignancies and other cancers, making them important therapeutic targets. Inhibition of individual downstream effector molecules (eg, RAF kinase) have been complicated by the rapid development of resistance or activation of bypass pathways. For the purpose of identifying novel targets in NRAS-transformed cells, we performed a chemical screen using mutant NRAS transformed Ba/F3 cells to identify compounds with selective cytotoxicity. One of the compounds identified, GNF-7, potently and selectively inhibited NRAS-dependent cells in preclinical models of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Mechanistic analysis revealed that its effects were mediated in part through combined inhibition of ACK1/AKT and of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2 (germinal center kinase). Similar to genetic synthetic lethal approaches, these results suggest that small molecule screens can be used to identity novel therapeutic targets in cells addicted to RAS oncogenes.

The Sequence of Cyclophosphamide and Myeloablative Total Body Irradiation in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients with Acute Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-03-31,"Limited clinical data are available to assess whether the sequencing of cyclophosphamide (Cy) and total body irradiation (TBI) changes outcomes. We evaluated the sequence in 1769 (CyTBI, n = 948; TBICy, n = 821) recipients of related or unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation who received TBI (1200 to 1500 cGY) for acute leukemia from 2003 to 2010. The 2 cohorts were comparable for median age, performance score, type of leukemia, first complete remission, Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, HLA-matched siblings, stem cell source, antithymocyte globulin use, TBI dose, and type of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The sequence of TBI did not significantly affect transplantation-related mortality (24% versus 23% at 3 years, P = .67; relative risk, 1.01; P = .91), leukemia relapse (27% versus 29% at 3 years, P = .34; relative risk, .89, P = .18), leukemia-free survival (49% versus 48% at 3 years, P = .27; relative risk, .93; P = .29), chronic GVHD (45% versus 47% at 1 year, P = .39; relative risk, .9; P = .11), or overall survival (53% versus 52% at 3 years, P = .62; relative risk, .96; P = .57) for CyTBI and TBICy, respectively.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-04-01,"The occurrence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) is common in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) but is of unknown significance in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. We retrospectively analyzed data from a consecutive case series of adults with Ph+ ALL who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) at City of Hope between 2003 and 2014. Among 130 adults with Ph+ ALL who had TKI therapy before alloHCT, 78 patients had available data on conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis and were eligible for outcomes analysis. ACAs were observed in 41 patients (53%). There were no statistically significant differences in median age, median initial WBC count, post-HCT TKI maintenance, or disease status at the time of transplant between the Ph-only and ACA cohorts; however, the Ph-only cohort had a higher rate of minimal residual disease positivity at the time of HCT. Three-year leukemia-free survival (79.8% versus 39.5%, P = .01) and 3-year overall survival (83% versus 45.6%, P = .02) were superior in the Ph-only cohort compared with the ACA cohort, respectively. Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration observed in our ACA cohort (n = 12). Thus, when TKI therapy and alloHCT are used as part of adult Ph+ ALL therapy, the presence of ACAs appears to have a significant deleterious effect on outcomes post-HCT.

PAX5 is a tumor suppressor in mouse mutagenesis models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-08,"Alterations of genes encoding transcriptional regulators of lymphoid development are a hallmark of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and most commonly involve PAX5, encoding the DNA-binding transcription factor paired-box 5. The majority of PAX5 alterations in ALL are heterozygous, and key PAX5 target genes are expressed in leukemic cells, suggesting that PAX5 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. To examine the role of PAX5 alterations in leukemogenesis, we performed mutagenesis screens of mice heterozygous for a loss-of-function Pax5 allele. Both chemical and retroviral mutagenesis resulted in a significantly increased penetrance and reduced latency of leukemia, with a shift to B-lymphoid lineage. Genomic profiling identified a high frequency of secondary genomic mutations, deletions, and retroviral insertions targeting B-lymphoid development, including Pax5, and additional genes and pathways mutated in ALL, including tumor suppressors, Ras, and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. These results show that in contrast to simple Pax5 haploinsufficiency, multiple sequential alterations targeting lymphoid development are central to leukemogenesis and contribute to the arrest in lymphoid maturation characteristic of ALL. This cross-species analysis also validates the importance of concomitant alterations of multiple cellular growth, signaling, and tumor suppression pathways in the pathogenesis of B-ALL.

Risk-adapted strategies are transforming the disease treatment and prognosis. With current treatment regimens, long-term survival is achieved by approximately 50% of patients with B-cell ALL, 50% to 60% of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, and approximately 80% of patients with Burkitt's leukemia. Genomic profiling in ALL has identified new prognostic markers, new therapeutic targets, and novel ALL subtypes. These may be amenable to future targeted therapies that can further improve outcomes. The early recognition of early precursor T-cell ALL, a distinct pathobiological entity with a poor prognosis, is essential for the development of an effective clinical management strategy. The role of monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic T-cell therapies continues to be defined. Many of the approaches are currently being evaluated for ALL salvage.

NALP3 inflammasome upregulation and CASP1 cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor cause glucocorticoid resistance in leukemia cells.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2015-05-04,"Glucocorticoids are universally used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and resistance to glucocorticoids in leukemia cells confers poor prognosis. To elucidate mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, we determined the prednisolone sensitivity of primary leukemia cells from 444 patients newly diagnosed with ALL and found significantly higher expression of CASP1 (encoding caspase 1) and its activator NLRP3 in glucocorticoid-resistant leukemia cells, resulting from significantly lower somatic methylation of the CASP1 and NLRP3 promoters. Overexpression of CASP1 resulted in cleavage of the glucocorticoid receptor, diminished the glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional response and increased glucocorticoid resistance. Knockdown or inhibition of CASP1 significantly increased glucocorticoid receptor levels and mitigated glucocorticoid resistance in CASP1-overexpressing ALL. Our findings establish a new mechanism by which the NLRP3-CASP1 inflammasome modulates cellular levels of the glucocorticoid receptor and diminishes cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. The broad impact on the glucocorticoid transcriptional response suggests that this mechanism could also modify glucocorticoid effects in other diseases.

Polymorphisms in Genes Related to Oxidative Stress Are Associated With Inferior Cognitive Function After Therapy for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-05-18,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exhibit increased rates of neurocognitive deficits. This study was conducted to test whether interpatient variability in neurocognitive outcomes can be explained by polymorphisms in candidate genes conferring susceptibility to neurocognitive decline. Neurocognitive testing was conducted in 350 pediatric leukemia survivors, treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocols 95-01 or 00-01. Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow collected at remission. Candidate polymorphisms were selected on the basis of prior literature, targeting genes related to drug metabolism, oxidative damage, altered neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and folate physiology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected using either a customized multiplexed Sequenom MassARRAY assay or polymerase chain reaction-based allelic discrimination assays. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of genotype on neurocognitive outcomes, adjusted for the effects of demographic and treatment variables. False-discovery rate correction was made for multiple hypothesis testing, indicated as a Q value.

Monoclonal antibodies in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-05-21,"With modern intensive combination polychemotherapy, the complete response (CR) rate in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is 80% to 90%, and the cure rate is 40% to 50%. Hence, there is a need to develop effective salvage therapies and combine novel agents with standard effective chemotherapy. ALL leukemic cells express several surface antigens amenable to target therapies, including CD20, CD22, and CD19. Monoclonal antibodies target these leukemic surface antigens selectively and minimize off-target toxicity. When added to frontline chemotherapy, rituximab, an antibody directed against CD20, increases cure rates of adults with Burkitt leukemia from 40% to 80% and those with pre-B ALL from 35% to 50%. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, a CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, has resulted in marrow CR rates of 55% and a median survival of 6 to 7 months when given to patients with refractory-relapsed ALL. Blinatumomab, a biallelic T cell engaging the CD3-CD19 monoclonal antibody, also resulted in overall response rates of 40% to 50% and a median survival of 6.5 months in a similar refractory-relapsed population. Other promising monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 (ofatumumab and obinutuzumab) or CD19 or CD20 and bound to different cytotoxins or immunotoxins are under development.

Bone marrow necrosis in acute leukemia: Clinical characteristic and outcome.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-07-27,"Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is characterized by infarction of the medullary stroma, leading to marrow necrosis with preserved cortical bone. In reported small series, BMN in hematological malignancies is associated with poor prognosis. We sought to find the impact of BMN on clinical outcome in a relatively larger cohort of patients with acute leukemias. Overall we evaluated 1,691 patients; 1,051 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 640 with acute lymphocytic leukemia referred to our institution between 2002 and 2013. Patients with AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were evaluated separately to determine the incidence of BMN, associated clinical features and its prognostic significance. At initial diagnosis, BMN was observed in 25 (2.4%) patients with AML and 20 (3.2%) patients with ALL. In AML, BMN was significantly associated with French-American-British AML M5 morphology (32% vs. 10%, P = 0.002). The complete remission (CR) rate in AML with and without BMN was 32% and 59% respectively (P = 0.008). Likewise, CR rate in ALL with BMN was also inferior, 70% vs. 92% (P = 0.005). The median overall survival (OS) in AML with BMN was significantly poorer, 3.7 months compared to 14 months without BMN (P = 0.003). Similarly, the median OS in ALL with and without BMN was 61.7 and 72 months respectively (P = 0.33). BMN is not a rare entity in AML and ALL, but is infrequent.

Long-term efficacy and safety of bosutinib in patients with advanced leukemia following resistance/intolerance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-06-01,"Long-term efficacy and safety of bosutinib (≥4 years follow-up from last enrolled patient) were evaluated in an ongoing phase 1/2 study in the advanced leukemia cohort with prior treatment failure (accelerated-phase [AP, n = 79] chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], blast-phase [BP, n = 64] CML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL, n = 24]). Fourteen AP, 2 BP, and 1 ALL patient remained on bosutinib at 4 years (vs. 38, 8, 1 at 1 year); median (range) treatment durations: 10.2 (0.1-88.6), 2.8 (0.03-55.9), 0.97 (0.3-89.2) months. Among AP and BP patients, 57% and 28% newly attained or maintained baseline overall hematologic response (OHR); 40% and 37% attained/maintained major cytogenetic response (MCyR) by 4 years (most by 12 months). In responders at 1 versus 4 years, Kaplan-Meier (KM) probabilities of maintaining OHR were 78% versus 49% (AP) and 28% versus 19% (BP); KM probabilities of maintaining MCyR were 65% versus 49% (AP) and 21% versus 21% (BP).

Cytogenetic Variation of B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia With Intrachromosomal Amplification of Chromosome 21 (iAMP21): A Multi-Institutional Series Review.,American journal of clinical pathology,Am. J. Clin. Pathol.,2015-07-01,"B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) is a relatively uncommon manifestation of acute leukemia and limited predominantly to the pediatric population. Case-specific information regarding flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory findings of this subtype of leukemia is currently lacking. We searched the databases of three large institutions for lymphoblastic leukemia with iAMP21 from 2005 through 2012 and analyzed the clinicopathologic features. We identified 17 cases with five or more RUNX1 signals on interphase nuclei, 14 of which were consistent with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) definition for iAMP21—namely, the presence of three or more RUNX1 signals on one marker chromosome. These cases showed a statistically significant lower peripheral WBC count and older age at diagnosis compared with all pediatric cases of B-ALL. We also identified three cases with increased RUNX1 signals scattered on multiple marker chromosomes that did not meet the COG definition of iAMP21 but showed similar 21q instability and older age at presentation. Our findings not only demonstrate that B-ALL with iAMP21 is truly a distinct clinicopathologic entity but also suggest that a subset of cases of B-ALL with iAMP21 can show variable cytogenetic features.",Journal Article,1665.0,7.0,B-lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL intrachromosomal amplification chromosome 21 iAMP21 relatively uncommon manifestation acute leukemia limited predominantly pediatric population Case-specific information flow cytometric morphologic laboratory findings subtype leukemia currently lacking searched databases large institutions lymphoblastic leukemia iAMP21 2005 2012 clinicopathologic features identified 17 cases RUNX1 signals interphase nuclei 14 consistent Children 's Oncology Group COG definition iAMP21—namely presence RUNX1 signals marker chromosome cases showed statistically significant lower peripheral WBC count older age diagnosis compared pediatric cases B-ALL identified cases increased RUNX1 signals scattered multiple marker chromosomes meet COG definition iAMP21 showed similar 21q instability older age presentation findings demonstrate B-ALL iAMP21 truly distinct clinicopathologic entity suggest subset cases B-ALL iAMP21 variable cytogenetic features,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 1275, 132, 62, 5, 24924, 1073, 1, 1170, 239, 32443, 16, 8, 1352, 2052, 6746, 1, 286, 2, 383, 2117, 6, 3, 815, 266, 473, 112, 487, 666, 1412, 6226, 2815, 2, 1624, 272, 1, 26, 875, 1, 16, 694, 1941, 21, 3080, 3, 2348, 1, 169, 375, 1764, 9, 1275, 5, 32443, 29, 1242, 298, 1195, 2, 311, 3, 1399, 404, 21, 108, 269, 140, 5, 365, 15, 80, 6092, 2312, 23, 8081, 4725, 213, 1, 92, 11, 925, 5, 3, 541, 292, 413, 87, 6377, 2470, 9, 66293, 3, 463, 1, 169, 15, 80, 6092, 2312, 23, 104, 952, 1170, 46, 140, 224, 8, 712, 93, 280, 672, 4685, 1276, 2, 434, 89, 28, 147, 72, 5, 62, 815, 140, 1, 132, 62, 21, 120, 108, 169, 140, 5, 101, 6092, 2312, 9638, 23, 232, 952, 3560, 17, 205, 44, 3362, 3, 6377, 2470, 1, 32443, 84, 224, 288, 25998, 1753, 2, 434, 89, 28, 1031, 114, 272, 44, 158, 608, 17, 132, 62, 5, 32443, 16, 7260, 8, 834, 1399, 2983, 84, 120, 309, 17, 8, 697, 1, 140, 1, 132, 62, 5, 32443, 122, 514, 1347, 1266, 404]",1263.0,26071468,Cytogenetic Variation B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia Intrachromosomal Amplification Chromosome 21 iAMP21 Multi-Institutional Series Review,0,0.0

Activity of the Type II JAK2 Inhibitor CHZ868 in B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2015-07-01,"A variety of cancers depend on JAK2 signaling, including the high-risk subset of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) with CRLF2 rearrangements. Type I JAK2 inhibitors induce paradoxical JAK2 hyperphosphorylation in these leukemias and have limited activity. To improve the efficacy of JAK2 inhibition in B-ALL, we developed the type II inhibitor CHZ868, which stabilizes JAK2 in an inactive conformation. CHZ868 potently suppressed the growth of CRLF2-rearranged human B-ALL cells, abrogated JAK2 signaling, and improved survival in mice with human or murine B-ALL.

High Disease-Free Survival with Enhanced Protection against Relapse after Double-Unit Cord Blood Transplantation When Compared with T Cell-Depleted Unrelated Donor Transplantation in Patients with Acute Leukemia and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-07-31,"Double-unit cord blood (DCB) grafts are a rapidly available stem cell source for adults with high-risk leukemias. However, how disease-free survival (DFS) after DCB transplantation (DCBT) compares to that of unrelated donor transplantation (URDT) is not fully established. We analyzed 166 allograft recipients (66 8/8 HLA-matched URDT, 45 7/8 HLA-matched URDT, and 55 DCBT) ages 16 to 60 years with high-risk acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). URDT and DCBT recipients were similar except DCBT recipients were more likely to have lower weight and non-European ancestry and to receive intermediate-intensity conditioning. All URDT recipients received a CD34(+) cell-selected (T cell-depleted) graft. Overall, differences between the 3-year transplantation-related mortality were not significant (8/8 URDT, 18%; 7/8 URDT, 39%; and DCBT, 24%; P = .108), whereas the 3-year relapse risk was decreased after DCBT (8/8 URDT, 23%; 7/8 URDT, 20%; and DCBT 9%, P = .037). Three-year DFS was 57% in 8/8 URDT, 41% in 7/8 URDT, and 68% in DCBT recipients (P = .068), and the 3-year DFS in DCBT recipients was higher than that of 7/8 URDT recipients (P = .021). In multivariate analysis in acute leukemia patients, factors adversely associated with DFS were female gender (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; P = .031), diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR, 2.09; P = .004), and 7/8 T cell-depleted URDT (HR, 1.91; P = .037). High DFS can be achieved in adults with acute leukemia and CML with low relapse rates after DCBT. Our findings support performing DCBT in adults in preference to HLA-mismatched T cell-depleted URDT and suggest DCBT is a readily available alternative to T cell-depleted 8/8 URDT, especially in patients requiring urgent transplantation.

Antileukemic Efficacy of Continuous vs Discontinuous Dexamethasone in Murine Models of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-08-07,"Osteonecrosis is one of the most common, serious, toxicities resulting from the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In recent years, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia clinical trials have used discontinuous rather than continuous dosing of dexamethasone in an effort to reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis. However, it is not known whether discontinuous dosing would compromise antileukemic efficacy of glucocorticoids. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of discontinuous dexamethasone against continuous dexamethasone in murine models bearing human acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts (n = 8 patient samples) or murine BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma dexamethasone concentrations (7.9 to 212 nM) were similar to those achieved in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using conventional dosages. The median leukemia-free survival ranged from 16 to 59 days; dexamethasone prolonged survival from a median of 4 to 129 days in all seven dexamethasone-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In the majority of cases (7 of 8 xenografts and the murine BCR-ABL model) we demonstrated equal efficacy of the two dexamethasone dosing regimens; whereas for one acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample, the discontinuous regimen yielded inferior antileukemic efficacy (log-rank p = 0.002). Our results support the clinical practice of using discontinuous rather than continuous dexamethasone dosing in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Genetics of glucocorticoid-associated osteonecrosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-08-11,"Glucocorticoids are important therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their major adverse effect is osteonecrosis. Our goal was to identify genetic and nongenetic risk factors for osteonecrosis. We performed a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a discovery cohort comprising 2285 children with ALL, treated on the Children's Oncology Group AALL0232 protocol (NCT00075725), adjusting for covariates. The minor allele at SNP rs10989692 (near the glutamate receptor GRIN3A locus) was associated with osteonecrosis (hazard ratio = 2.03; P = 3.59 × 10(-7)). The association was supported by 2 replication cohorts, including 361 children with ALL on St. Jude's Total XV protocol (NCT00137111) and 309 non-ALL patients from Vanderbilt University's BioVU repository treated with glucocorticoids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87 and 2.26; P = .063 and .0074, respectively). In a meta-analysis, rs10989692 was also highest ranked (P = 2.68 × 10(-8)), and the glutamate pathway was the top ranked pathway (P = 9.8 × 10(-4)). Osteonecrosis-associated glutamate receptor variants were also associated with other vascular phenotypes including cerebral ischemia (OR = 1.64; P = 2.5 × 10(-3)), and arterial embolism and thrombosis (OR = 1.88; P = 4.2 × 10(-3)).

"Blinatumomab for the Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative, Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-08-17,"Blinatumomab is a CD19/CD3 bispescific antibody designed to redirect T cells toward malignant B cells and induce their lysis. It recently gained accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR-ALL). In the phase II trial that served as the basis for approval, blinatumomab demonstrated significant single-agent activity and induced remission [complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh)] in 43% of 189 adult patients with RR-ALL; the majority of responders (82%) also attained negative minimal residual disease (MRD(-)) status that did not generally translate into long-term remissions in most cases. Additional studies show that blinatumomab can induce high response rates associated with lasting remissions in patients in first remission treated for MRD positivity, suggesting a role for blinatumomab in the upfront, MRD-positive setting. Blinatumomab infusion follows a predictable immunopharmacologic profile, including early cytokine release that can be associated with a clinical syndrome, T-cell expansion, and B-cell depletion. Neurologic toxicities represent a unique toxicity that shares similarities with adverse effects of other T-cell engaging therapies. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal disease setting and timing for blinatumomab therapy. Additional insights into the pathogenesis, risk factors, and prevention of neurologic toxicities as well as a better understanding of the clinical consequences and biologic pathways that are associated with drug resistance are needed.",Journal Article,1618.0,12.0,Blinatumomab CD19/CD3 bispescific antibody designed redirect malignant B induce lysis recently gained accelerated approval FDA treatment relapsed refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia RR-ALL phase II trial served basis approval blinatumomab demonstrated significant single-agent activity induced remission complete remission CR CR incomplete recovery peripheral blood counts CRh 43 189 adult patients RR-ALL majority responders 82 attained negative minimal residual disease MRD status generally translate long-term remissions cases Additional studies blinatumomab induce high response rates associated lasting remissions patients remission treated MRD positivity suggesting role blinatumomab upfront MRD-positive setting Blinatumomab infusion follows predictable immunopharmacologic profile including early cytokine release associated clinical syndrome T-cell expansion B-cell depletion Neurologic toxicities represent unique toxicity shares similarities adverse effects T-cell engaging therapies studies needed clarify optimal disease setting timing blinatumomab therapy Additional insights pathogenesis risk factors prevention neurologic toxicities better understanding clinical consequences biologic pathways associated drug resistance needed,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7182, 16, 8, 3158, 3117, 66667, 548, 1114, 6, 14744, 102, 37, 1317, 393, 132, 37, 2, 1290, 136, 4783, 192, 761, 3711, 2241, 1814, 20, 3, 2078, 9, 3, 24, 1, 591, 15, 430, 3006, 1170, 199, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 861, 62, 4, 3, 124, 215, 160, 17, 5275, 22, 3, 877, 9, 1814, 7182, 264, 93, 226, 420, 128, 2, 277, 734, 236, 734, 684, 2, 684, 5, 2610, 1602, 1, 672, 315, 1911, 18100, 4, 601, 1, 5899, 780, 7, 5, 861, 62, 3, 686, 1, 1983, 878, 120, 5105, 199, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 156, 17, 205, 44, 1228, 4509, 237, 319, 337, 3166, 4, 96, 140, 402, 94, 514, 17, 7182, 122, 1290, 64, 51, 151, 41, 5, 3443, 3166, 4, 7, 4, 157, 734, 73, 9, 2029, 1887, 802, 8, 200, 9, 7182, 4, 3, 2941, 2029, 109, 546, 7182, 904, 2962, 8, 7639, 66668, 800, 141, 191, 1675, 2008, 17, 122, 40, 41, 5, 8, 38, 681, 102, 31, 1422, 2, 132, 31, 2286, 2543, 385, 1231, 8, 991, 155, 17, 10641, 6089, 5, 290, 176, 1, 127, 102, 31, 8534, 235, 195, 94, 32, 575, 6, 3968, 3, 665, 34, 546, 2, 1972, 9, 7182, 36, 402, 1957, 237, 3, 1384, 43, 130, 2, 1070, 1, 2543, 385, 22, 149, 22, 8, 380, 612, 1, 3, 38, 3255, 2, 1283, 460, 17, 32, 41, 5, 234, 251, 32, 575]",1608.0,26283683,Blinatumomab Treatment Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative Precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,0,0.0

A review of English literature on childhood ALL focusing on collaborative studies was performed. The resulting article was reviewed and revised by the committee chairs of the major ALL study groups. With long-term survival rates for ALL approaching 90% and the advent of high-resolution genome-wide analyses, several international study groups or consortia were established to conduct collaborative research to further improve outcome. As a result, treatment strategies have been improved for several subtypes of ALL, such as infant, MLL-rearranged, Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL. Many recurrent genetic abnormalities that respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and multiple genetic determinants of drug resistance and toxicities have been identified to help develop targeted therapy. Several genetic polymorphisms have been recognized that show susceptibility to developing ALL and that help explain the racial/ethnic differences in the incidence of ALL. The information gained from collaborative studies has helped decipher the heterogeneity of ALL to help improve personalized treatment, which will further advance the current high cure rate and the quality of life for children and adolescents with ALL.",Historical Article,1611.0,265.0,review impact collaborative studies advances treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia children adolescents review English literature childhood focusing collaborative studies performed resulting article reviewed revised committee chairs major groups long-term survival rates approaching 90 advent high-resolution genome-wide international groups consortia established conduct collaborative research improve outcome treatment strategies improved subtypes infant MLL-rearranged Philadelphia chromosome-positive Philadelphia chromosome-like recurrent genetic abnormalities respond tyrosine kinase inhibitors multiple genetic determinants drug resistance toxicities identified help develop targeted therapy genetic polymorphisms recognized susceptibility developing help explain racial/ethnic differences incidence information gained collaborative studies helped decipher heterogeneity help improve personalized treatment advance current high cure rate quality life children adolescents,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 206, 3, 345, 1, 3737, 94, 23, 954, 4, 3, 891, 2, 24, 1, 286, 1275, 62, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 8, 206, 1, 4201, 789, 23, 864, 62, 3312, 23, 3737, 94, 10, 173, 3, 1113, 946, 10, 446, 2, 4218, 20, 3, 2002, 49260, 1, 3, 458, 62, 45, 271, 5, 319, 337, 25, 151, 9, 62, 7773, 424, 2, 3, 4114, 1, 64, 2125, 898, 1019, 318, 392, 944, 45, 271, 15, 14303, 11, 635, 6, 4073, 3737, 389, 6, 195, 401, 228, 22, 8, 757, 24, 422, 47, 85, 231, 9, 392, 814, 1, 62, 225, 22, 8027, 3049, 3201, 3006, 1170, 109, 2, 3006, 1170, 733, 62, 445, 387, 336, 1171, 17, 1892, 6, 564, 216, 222, 2, 232, 336, 3403, 1, 234, 251, 2, 385, 47, 85, 108, 6, 987, 690, 238, 36, 392, 336, 1203, 47, 85, 1904, 17, 514, 1432, 6, 931, 62, 2, 17, 987, 2943, 3, 2257, 2871, 362, 4, 3, 287, 1, 62, 3, 487, 3711, 29, 3737, 94, 71, 6156, 11805, 3, 1144, 1, 62, 6, 987, 401, 2175, 24, 92, 303, 195, 3148, 3, 291, 64, 1722, 116, 2, 3, 372, 1, 358, 9, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 62]",1374.0,26304874,Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Progress Collaboration,328,0.3584699453551913
"Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Children and Adolescents: Progress Through Effective Collaboration, Current Knowledge, and Challenges Ahead.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-08-24,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the fourth most common malignancy in children, has an even higher incidence in adolescents, and is primarily represented by only a few histologic subtypes. Dramatic progress has been achieved, with survival rates exceeding 80%, in large part because of a better understanding of the biology of the different subtypes and national and international collaborations. Most patients with Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are cured with short intensive pulse chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and high-dose methotrexate. The benefit of the addition of rituximab has not been established except in the case of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is treated with intensive, semi-continuous, longer leukemia-derived protocols. Relapses in B-cell and lymphoblastic lymphomas are rare and infrequently curable, even with intensive approaches. Event-free survival rates of approximately 75% have been achieved in anaplastic large-cell lymphomas with various regimens that generally include a short intensive B-like regimen. Immunity seems to play an important role in prognosis and needs further exploration to determine its therapeutic application. ALK inhibitor therapeutic approaches are currently under investigation. For all pediatric lymphomas, the intensity of induction/consolidation therapy correlates with acute toxicities, but because of low cumulative doses of anthracyclines and alkylating agents, minimal or no long-term toxicity is expected. Challenges that remain include defining the value of prognostic factors, such as early response on positron emission tomography/computed tomography and minimal disseminated and residual disease, using new biologic technologies to improve risk stratification, and developing innovative therapies, both in the first-line setting and for relapse.

Patients received dasatinib with 8 cycles of alternating hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission (CR) continued maintenance dasatinib, vincristine, and prednisone for 2 years, which was followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) received it during their first CR. Seventy-two patients with a median age of 55 years (range, 21-80 years) were treated; 69 (96%) achieved CR. Among them, 57 (83%) achieved cytogenetic CR after 1 cycle, and 64 (93%) achieved a major molecular response at a median of 4 weeks (range, 2-38 weeks). Sixty-five patients (94%) were negative for minimal residual disease assessed by flow cytometry at a median of 3 weeks (range, 2-37 weeks). Dasatinib-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events included bleeding, pleural/pericardial effusions, and elevated transaminases. With a median follow-up of 67 months (range, 33-97 months), 33 patients (46%) were alive, and 30 (43%) were in CR; 12 underwent allogeneic SCT. Thirty-nine patients died (3 at induction, 19 after relapse, 7 after SCT performed during first CR, and 10 during CR).

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-08-29,"The inclusion of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in cord blood transplantation is controversial. We evaluated outcomes according to ATG inclusion in 297 children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received myeloablative total body irradiation-based conditioning and either single-unit (74%) or double-unit (26%) grafts. Ninety-two patients (31%) received ATG and 205 (69%) did not. ATG recipients were more likely to be cytomegalovirus seronegative. The incidences of day 100 grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; 30% versus 54%, P = .0002) and chronic GVHD (22% versus 43%, P = .0008) were lower with ATG compared with non-ATG regimens. However, day 100 grades III to IV acute GVHD was comparable (11% versus 17%, P = .15). The 3-year incidences of transplant-related mortality (16% versus 17%, P = .98), relapse (17% versus 27%, P = .12), and leukemia-free survival (66% versus 55%, P = .23) in ATG and non-ATG recipients were similar. There were no differences in viral reactivation between treatment groups (60% versus 58%, P = .83).

In a single-arm, multicenter study, we evaluated nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) and toxicity with intravenously administered asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (IV-Erwinia) in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma with hypersensitivity to E.coli-derived asparaginase. Between 2012 and 2013, 30 patients (age 1-17 years) enrolled from 10 centers. Patients received IV-Erwinia, 25,000 IU/m(2)/dose on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, for 2 consecutive-weeks (6 doses = 1 cycle) for each dose of pegaspargase remaining in the original treatment plan. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients achieving NSAA ≥ 0.1 IU/ml 48 hr after dose 5 in Cycle 1. Secondary objectives included determining the proportion achieving NSAA ≥ 0.1 IU/ml 72 hr after Cycle 1 dose 6, and the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicities. Twenty-six patients completed Cycle 1; 24 were evaluable for NSAA assessment. In Cycle 1, NSAA ≥ 0.10 IU/ml was detected in 83% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 63-95%) 48 hr post-dose 5 (mean ± SD; 0.32 IU/ml ± 0.23), and in 43% (95% CI, 22-66%) 72 hr post-dose 6 (mean ± SD; 0.089 IU/ml ± 0.072). For all 30 patients over all cycles, hypersensitivity/infusional reactions with IV-Erwinia occurred in 37%, pancreatitis 7%, and thrombosis 3%. IV-Erwinia administration in children/adolescents appeared feasible and tolerable.

Novel Management Options for Adult Patients With Progressive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Case-Study Compendium.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2015-06-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by highly proliferative immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. In adults, ALL accounts for approximately 20% of all adult leukemias. ALL carries a poor prognosis in adults. The 5-year overall survival is 24% in patients ages 40 to 59 years and 18% in patients ages 60 to 69 years. ALL can be grouped into different categories according to its cell lineage (B cell or T cell), the presence or absence of the Philadelphia chromosome, and various cytogenetic and molecular classifications. A main goal of treatment is to allow the patient to achieve a complete remission and to consolidate this remission with either a maintenance regimen or an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Although the overall rate of complete remission following frontline therapy for newly diagnosed ALL is high, the majority of patients experience a disease relapse. In general, the duration of initial complete remission impacts the patient’s prognosis and response to further therapies. Subsequent treatments must balance the goal of achieving a remission with the need for the patient to maintain or improve quality of life. Recently approved agents, such as blinatumomab and vincristine sulfate liposome injection, offer the promise of a second remission that can serve as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplant while still maintaining quality of life.

Patients were divided into two cohorts: Stratum A [relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML; except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia] and Stratum B (relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic leukemia; CLL/sCLL). Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity. RG7112 was administered to 116 patients (96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure. Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD, including 5 patients who met International Working Group (IWG) criteria for response. Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14% of Stratum A patients and in 40% of Stratum B patients. Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity. p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells. Baseline expression levels of MDM2 correlated positively with clinical response. RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity against relapsed/refractory AML and CLL/sCLL. MDM2 inhibition resulted in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes. We provide proof-of-concept that MDM2 inhibition restores p53 function and generates clinical responses in hematologic malignancies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1562.0,93.0,RG7112 small-molecule MDM2 antagonist MDM2 negative regulator suppressor p53 frequently overexpressed leukemias phase RG7112 patients hematologic malignancies conducted Primary objectives included determination dose safety profile RG7112 Secondary objectives included evaluation pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics TP53-mutation status MDM2 expression preliminary clinical activity Patients divided cohorts Stratum relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia AML acute promyelocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia Stratum B relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia CLL/sCLL Stratum patients treated MTD assess clinical activity RG7112 administered 116 patients 96 patients Stratum 20 patients Stratum B patients experienced 1 adverse event 3 dose-limiting toxicities reported Pharmacokinetic indicated twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure Antileukemia activity observed 30 patients AML assessed MTD including 5 patients met International Working Group IWG criteria response Exploratory revealed TP53 14 Stratum patients 40 Stratum B patients patients TP53 exhibited clinical activity p53 target induced TP53 wild-type leukemic Baseline expression levels MDM2 correlated positively clinical response RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity relapsed/refractory AML CLL/sCLL MDM2 inhibition resulted p53 stabilization transcriptional activation p53-target provide proof-of-concept MDM2 inhibition restores p53 function generates clinical responses hematologic malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[22908, 16, 8, 302, 1354, 3277, 3137, 3277, 16, 8, 199, 2452, 1, 3, 30, 1245, 624, 2, 746, 1711, 4, 2792, 631, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 22908, 4, 7, 5, 813, 441, 10, 426, 86, 45, 2409, 159, 3104, 1, 3, 61, 2, 367, 800, 1, 22908, 568, 2409, 159, 451, 1, 1159, 3587, 225, 22, 1206, 258, 156, 2, 3277, 55, 2, 1676, 38, 128, 7, 11, 2176, 237, 100, 736, 4897, 8, 591, 430, 286, 533, 329, 2187, 286, 4300, 286, 1275, 2, 442, 2194, 2, 4897, 132, 591, 430, 442, 1193, 2647, 302, 31, 1193, 552, 49333, 476, 4897, 8, 7, 11, 73, 28, 3, 961, 6, 423, 38, 128, 22908, 10, 468, 6, 3790, 7, 921, 7, 4, 4897, 8, 2, 179, 7, 4, 4897, 132, 62, 7, 592, 28, 506, 14, 290, 774, 2, 27, 61, 817, 385, 11, 210, 1456, 65, 1103, 17, 936, 391, 1280, 651, 391, 645, 9169, 128, 10, 164, 4, 3, 201, 7, 5, 329, 275, 28, 3, 961, 141, 33, 7, 54, 543, 944, 2644, 87, 14620, 371, 9, 51, 2386, 65, 553, 1206, 138, 4, 213, 1, 4897, 8, 7, 2, 4, 327, 1, 4897, 132, 7, 100, 7, 5, 1206, 138, 1416, 38, 128, 624, 283, 214, 11, 277, 158, 4, 1206, 955, 267, 2015, 37, 330, 55, 148, 1, 3277, 438, 2375, 5, 38, 51, 22908, 264, 38, 128, 480, 591, 430, 329, 2, 552, 49333, 3277, 297, 627, 4, 624, 3184, 2, 1431, 363, 1, 624, 283, 214, 21, 377, 3840, 1, 2545, 17, 3277, 297, 8489, 624, 343, 2, 7919, 38, 253, 4, 813, 441]",1871.0,26459177,Phase Trial RG7112 Small-Molecule MDM2 Antagonist Leukemia,0,0.0

Clin. Oncol.,2015-10-12,"Children receiving CNS-directed therapy for cancer are at risk for cognitive problems, with few available empirically supported interventions. Cognitive problems indicate neurodevelopmental disruption that may be modifiable with intervention. This study evaluated short-term efficacy of a computerized cognitive training program and neural correlates of cognitive change. A total of 68 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT) with identified cognitive deficits were randomly assigned to computerized cognitive intervention (male, n = 18; female, n = 16; ALL, n = 23; BT, n = 11; mean age ± standard deviation, 12.21 ± 2.47 years) or waitlist (male, n = 18; female, n = 16; ALL, n = 24; BT, n = 10; median age ± standard deviation, 11.82 ± 2.42 years).

Targeting bone marrow lymphoid niches in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2015-10-01,"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) the bone marrow microenvironment provides growth and survival signals that may confer resistance to chemotherapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) potently inhibits lymphopoiesis by targeting stromal cells that comprise the lymphoid niche in the bone marrow. To determine whether lymphoid niche disruption by G-CSF sensitizes ALL cells to chemotherapy, we conducted a pilot study of G-CSF in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Thirteen patients were treated on study; three patients achieved a complete remission (CR/CRi) for an overall response rate of 23%. In the healthy volunteers, G-CSF treatment disrupted the lymphoid niche, as evidenced by reduced expression of CXCL12, interleukin-7, and osteocalcin. However, in most patients with relapsed/refractory ALL expression of these genes was markedly suppressed at baseline. Thus, although G-CSF treatment was associated with ALL cell mobilization into the blood, and increased apoptosis of bone marrow resident ALL cells, alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment were modest and highly variable. These data suggest that disruption of lymphoid niches by G-CSF to sensitize ALL cells to chemotherapy may be best accomplished in the consolidation where the bone marrow microenvironment is more likely to be normal.

Implications and Management of Central Nervous System Involvement before Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-10-19,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a history of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, either at diagnosis or relapse, poses challenges when the decision is made to proceed with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), as there is no evidence-based consensus on the best peri-transplantation approach to reduce subsequent CNS relapse risk. Here, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 87 patients with ALL and a history of CNS involvement who later underwent alloHCT. Patients with pretransplantation CNS involvement had higher risk of CNS relapse after transplantation (2-year CNS relapse: 9.6% versus 1.4%, P < .0001), inferior event-free survival (EFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52; P = .003), and worse overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.55; P = .003) compared with patients without pretransplantation CNS involvement (n = 543). There was no difference in post-transplantation CNS relapse, EFS, or OS among patients presenting with CNS involvement at diagnosis, those with isolated CNS relapse, and those with combined bone marrow and CNS relapse before HCT. Interestingly, neither pretransplantation cranial irradiation, use of total body irradiation-based conditioning, nor post-transplantation prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy were associated with a reduction of CNS relapse risk after transplantation.

We explored the impact of central nervous system (CNS) involvement on outcome of pediatric patients with ALL in Tanzania. Comprehensive chart review was performed to characterize CNS involvement, treatment, and outcomes of pediatric patients with ALL at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. One hundred fifty-six patients with confirmed ALL had accessible data, and 128 initiated therapy. Sixteen percent of 156 patients had a documented cerebral spinal fluid analysis by cytospin. Seventy patients (45%) had a documented lumbar puncture with intrathecal (IT) therapy within 1 week of diagnosis. Thirteen patients presented with CNS involvement at diagnosis based on cytospin and/or unequivocal symptoms. Twenty-one patients (16%) experienced CNS relapse, three of whom had CNS disease at diagnosis. Median event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 7.9 months and estimated EFS at 24 months was 31%. For the patients with CNS involvement at diagnosis, the estimated EFS at 24 months was 45%. Only three of 21 patients with CNS relapse were still alive with a median follow up of 3 months. The rate of CNS disease in patients with ALL in Dar es Salaam at diagnosis and relapse was higher than that reported in HIC, and overall survival was lower.

De Novo MYC and BCL2 Double-hit B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BCP-ALL) in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients Associated With Poor Prognosis.,Pediatric hematology and oncology,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2015-11-11,"MYC and BCL2 translocations in B-cell lymphomas are defined as ""double-hit"" associated with poor prognosis in adult patients. Such double-hit events are extremely rare in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), especially in pediatric patients or young adults. This study is to investigate the clinical manifestation of de novo MYCyBCL2 double-hit BCP-ALL in young patients. Two pediatric and one young adult patients were identified after a retrospective data review and all without previous history of lymphoma. There were two females and one male aged 15, 18, and 24, respectively. All patients had an unremarkable medical history before presenting with extensive bone marrow and central nervous system involvement at diagnosis. Flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis showed an immature B-cell immunophenotype (CD10+, CD19+, TdT+, surface Ig-) and immunohistochemistry showed high expression of MYC and BCL2 in all cases. All patients showed complex karyotypes associated with 8q24 abnormalities in the form of t(8;9)(q24;p13) or t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed MYC and BCL2 rearrangements. Two patients died of refractory disease or disease progression 7 and 13 months after initial diagnosis, respectively, and the third patient was treated with protocol AALL0232 under the Children's Oncology Group study, achieved complete remission and remained in remission for 53 months at last follow-up. Our study showed that De novo MYCyBCL2 double-hit BCP-ALL is a rare disease that also occurs in pediatric and young adult patients and associated with complex karyotypes and poor prognosis.

CD19-Targeted T Cells for Hematologic Malignancies: Clinical Experience to Date.,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",Cancer J,,"Recently, immunotherapy for cancer has begun to garner traction with encouraging results in a number of malignancies. Included within this arena has been the genetic engineering of autologous T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against tumor target. The majority of this experience has included the use of CAR T cells directed against CD19 for B-cell hematologic malignancies. The most striking efficacy to date with CAR T cells directed against CD19 has been in relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with the overwhelming majority of patients experiencing complete remissions. In addition, single-center and largely early-phase studies have demonstrated responses in patients with varying histologic findings of relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The favorable response rates seen with this technology have been tempered by the high risk of toxicity, particularly in the form of cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Agents such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids have been used to treat these toxicities. The current state of the science includes strategies to circumvent and treat toxicity, manufacturing, and study of later-generation CAR constructs with the intention of improving efficacy and development of CARs against other tumor targets for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. The observation of an early efficacy ensures further integration and development of this modality into future immunotherapeutic strategies for various cancers.

The use of novel monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2015-01-01,"Regardless of age, patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have extremely poor outcomes. The success of reinduction chemotherapy remains dismal, because complete remission rates are low and seldom durable. Clearly, new and novel strategies are needed to improve the outcome of patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Patients with early relapse, especially those still receiving chemotherapy, tend to have a much poorer outcome and are often chemotherapy resistant. Although high-dose approaches may overcome chemotherapy resistance, long-term disease-free and overall survival remains limited. Several approaches have been used to target antigens, including cluster of differentiation (CD) 19, CD20, CD22, and CD52, on the surface of the malignant lymphoblast with striking efficacy.

Acute respiratory infections in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-12-23,"Knowledge regarding the incidence, clinical course, and impact of respiratory viral infections in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is limited. A retrospective cohort of patients with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated on the Total Therapy XVI protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 2007 and 2011 was evaluated. Of 223 children, 95 (43%) developed 133 episodes of viral acute respiratory illness (ARI) (incidence, 1.1 per 1000 patient-days). ARI without viral etiology was identified in 65 patients (29%) and no ARI was detected in 63 patients (28%). There were no significant associations noted between race, sex, age, or ALL risk group and the development of ARI. Children receiving induction chemotherapy were found to be at the highest risk of viral ARI (incidence, 2.3 per 1000 patient-days). Influenza virus was the most common virus (38%) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (33%). Of 133 episodes of viral ARI, 61% of patients were hospitalized, 26% experienced a complicated course, 80% had their chemotherapy delayed, and 0.7% of patients died. Twenty-four patients (18%) developed viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), 5 of whom (21%) had complications. Patients with viral LRTI had a significantly lower nadir absolute lymphocyte count; were sicker at the time of presentation; and were more likely to have respiratory syncytial virus, to be hospitalized, and to have their chemotherapy delayed for longer compared with those with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Despite the low incidence of viral ARI in children with ALL, the associated morbidity, mortality, and delay in chemotherapy remain clinically significant. Viral LRTI was especially associated with high morbidity requiring intensive care-level support.

Pediatric-inspired therapy compared to allografting for Philadelphia chromosome-negative adult ALL in first complete remission.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-03-01,"For adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established curative strategy. However, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy may also offer durable leukemia-free survival in the absence of HCT. We compared 422 HCT recipients aged 18-50 years with Ph-ALL in CR1 reported to the CIBMTR with an age-matched concurrent cohort of 108 Ph- ALL CR1 patients who received a Dana-Farber Consortium pediatric-inspired non-HCT regimen. At 4 years of follow-up, incidence of relapse after HCT was 24% (95% CI 19-28) versus 23% (95% CI 15-32) for the non-HCT (chemo) cohort (P=0.97). Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was higher in the HCT cohort [HCT 37% (95% CI 31-42) versus chemo 6% (95% CI 3-12), P<0.0001]. DFS in the HCT cohort was 40% (95% CI 35-45) versus 71% (95% CI 60-79) for chemo, P<0.0001. Similarly, OS favored chemo [HCT 45% (95% CI 40-50)] versus chemo 73% [(95% CI 63-81), P<0.0001]. In multivariable analysis, the sole factor predictive of shorter OS was the administration of HCT [hazard ratio 3.12 (1.99-4.90), P<0.0001]. For younger adults with Ph- ALL, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy had lower TRM, no increase in relapse, and superior overall survival compared to HCT. Am. J.

Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ETP-ALL/LBL) in adolescents and adults: a high-risk subtype.,Blood,Blood,2016-01-08,"Early T-cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL) is a recently recognized high-risk T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) subgroup. The optimal therapeutic approaches to adult patients with ETP-ALL/LBL are poorly characterized. In this study, we compared the outcomes of adults with ETP-ALL/LBL who received treatment on frontline regimens with those of patients with other T-ALL/LBL immunophenotypic subtypes. Patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL/LBL who received frontline chemotherapy between the years 2000 and 2014 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were identified and immunophenotypically categorized into early, thymic, and mature per the World Health Organization (WHO) classification using CD1a and surface CD3 status. Patients with ETP-ALL/LBL were identified on the basis of the following immunophenotypes: CD1a(-), CD8(-), CD5(-)(dim), and positivity for 1 or more stem cell or myeloid antigens. A total of 111 patients with T-ALL/LBL (68% T-ALL; 32% T-LBL) with adequate immunophenotype data were identified. The median age was 30 years (range, 13-79). There was no difference in the outcomes of patients based on the WHO subtypes. Nineteen patients (17%) had ETP-ALL/LBL. The complete remission rate /complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery rate in patients with ETP-ALL/LBL was significantly lower than that of non-ETP-ALL/LBL patients (73% vs 91%;P= .03).

Influence of Cranial Radiotherapy on Outcome in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated With Contemporary Therapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-01-11,"We sought to determine whether cranial radiotherapy (CRT) is necessary to prevent relapse in any subgroup of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We obtained aggregate data on relapse and survival outcomes for 16,623 patients age 1 to 18 years old with newly diagnosed ALL treated between 1996 and 2007 by 10 cooperative study groups from around the world. The proportion of patients eligible for prophylactic CRT varied from 0% to 33% by trial and was not related to the proportion eligible for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission. Using a random effects model, with CRT as a dichotomous covariate, we performed a single-arm meta-analysis to compare event-free survival and cumulative incidence of isolated or any CNS relapse and isolated bone marrow relapse in high-risk subgroups of patients who either did or did not receive CRT. Although there was significant heterogeneity in all outcome end points according to trial, CRT was associated with a reduced risk of relapse only in the small subgroup of patients with overt CNS disease at diagnosis, who had a significantly lower risk of isolated CNS relapse (4% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .02) and a trend toward lower risk of any CNS relapse (7% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .09). However, this group had a relatively high rate of events regardless of whether or not they received CRT (32% [95% CI, 26% to 39%] v 34% [95% CI, 19% to 54%]; P = .8).

Reduction in Late Mortality among 5-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2016-01-13,"Among patients in whom childhood cancer was diagnosed in the 1970s and 1980s, 18% of those who survived for 5 years died within the subsequent 25 years. In recent decades, cancer treatments have been modified with the goal of reducing life-threatening late effects. We evaluated late mortality among 34,033 patients in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort who survived at least 5 years after childhood cancer (i.e., cancer diagnosed before the age of 21 years) for which treatment was initiated during the period from 1970 through 1999. The median follow-up was 21 years (range, 5 to 38). We evaluated demographic and disease factors that were associated with death from health-related causes (i.e., conditions that exclude recurrence or progression of the original cancer and external causes but include the late effects of cancer therapy) using cumulative incidence and piecewise exponential models to estimate relative rates and 95% confidence intervals. Of the 3958 deaths that occurred during the study period, 1618 (41%) were attributable to health-related causes, including 746 deaths from subsequent neoplasms, 241 from cardiac causes, 137 from pulmonary causes, and 494 from other causes. A reduction in 15-year mortality was observed for death from any cause (from 12.4% in the early 1970s to 6.0% in the 1990s, P<0.001 for trend) and from health-related causes (from 3.5% to 2.1%, P<0.001 for trend). These reductions were attributable to decreases in the rates of death from subsequent neoplasm (P<0.001), cardiac causes (P<0.001), and pulmonary causes (P=0.04). Changes in therapy according to decade included reduced rates of cranial radiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (85% in the 1970s, 51% in the 1980s, and 19% in the 1990s), of abdominal radiotherapy for Wilms' tumor (78%, 53%, and 43%, respectively), of chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (87%, 79%, and 61%, respectively), and of anthracycline exposure. Reduction in treatment exposure was associated with reduced late mortality among survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms' tumor. The strategy of lowering therapeutic exposure has contributed to an observed decline in late mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer.

Impaired mitochondrial function is abrogated by dexrazoxane in doxorubicin-treated childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-01-13,"Impaired cardiac function in doxorubicin-treated childhood cancer survivors is partly mediated by the disruption of mitochondrial energy production. Doxorubicin intercalates into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and disrupts genes encoding for polypeptides that make adenosine triphosphate. This cross-sectional study examined mtDNA copy numbers per cell and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 64 childhood survivors of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had been treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute childhood ALL protocols and had received doxorubicin alone (42%) or doxorubicin with the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane (58%). The number of mtDNA copies per cell and the OXPHOS enzyme activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (complex I [CI]) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV [CIV]) were measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction immunoassays and thin-layer chromatography, respectively. At a median follow-up of 7.8 years after treatment, the median number of mtDNA copies per cell for patients treated with doxorubicin alone (1106.3) was significantly higher than the median number for those who had also received dexrazoxane (310.5; P = .001). No significant differences were detected between the groups for CI or CIV activity.

There are two major preparations available and FDA approved in the United States today, one derived from Escherichia coli and the other from Erwinia chrysanthemi.

Erwinia asparaginase has been used in cases of hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginases, which has been reported in up to 30% of patients.

A Phase II Study of Coltuximab Ravtansine (SAR3419) Monotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2015-12-21,"Long-term disease-free survival in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains unsatisfactory, and the treatment options are limited for those patients with relapse or a failure to respond after initial therapy. We conducted a dose-escalation/expansion phase II, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the optimal dose of coltuximab ravtansine (SAR3419), an anti-CD19 antibody-drug conjugate, in this setting. The dose-escalation part of the study determined the selected dose of coltuximab ravtansine for the evaluation of efficacy and safety in the dose-expansion phase. Patients received coltuximab ravtansine induction therapy (≤ 8 weekly doses). The responding patients were eligible for maintenance therapy (biweekly administration for ≤ 24 weeks). Three dose levels of coltuximab ravtansine were examined: 55, 70, and 90 mg/m(2). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included the duration of response (DOR) and safety. A total of 36 patients were treated: 19 during dose escalation and 17 during dose expansion. One dose-limiting toxicity was observed at 90 mg/m(2) (grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy); therefore, 70 mg/m(2) was selected for the dose-expansion phase. Five patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were pyrexia, diarrhea, and nausea. Of the 17 evaluable patients treated at the selected dose, 4 had a disease response (estimated ORR using the Bayesian method: 25.5% (80% confidence interval, 14.2%-39.6%). The DOR was 1.9 months (range, 1-5.6 months). Because of these results, the study was prematurely discontinued. Coltuximab ravtansine was well tolerated but was associated with a low clinical response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1492.0,32.0,Long-term disease-free survival adult patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains unsatisfactory treatment options limited patients relapse failure respond initial therapy conducted dose-escalation/expansion phase II multicenter single-arm determine optimal dose coltuximab ravtansine SAR3419 anti-CD19 antibody-drug conjugate setting dose-escalation determined selected dose coltuximab ravtansine evaluation efficacy safety dose-expansion phase Patients received coltuximab ravtansine induction therapy ≤ 8 weekly doses responding patients eligible maintenance therapy biweekly administration ≤ 24 weeks dose levels coltuximab ravtansine examined 55 70 90 mg/m 2 primary endpoint objective response rate ORR secondary endpoints included duration response DOR safety total 36 patients treated 19 dose escalation 17 dose expansion dose-limiting toxicity observed 90 mg/m 2 grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy 70 mg/m 2 selected dose-expansion phase patients discontinued therapy adverse events AEs common AEs pyrexia diarrhea nausea 17 evaluable patients treated selected dose 4 disease response estimated ORR Bayesian 25.5 80 confidence interval 14.2 -39.6 DOR 1.9 months range 1-5.6 months prematurely discontinued Coltuximab ravtansine tolerated associated low clinical response rate patients relapsed refractory,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[319, 337, 34, 115, 25, 4, 780, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 469, 9573, 2, 3, 24, 838, 32, 383, 9, 135, 7, 5, 429, 15, 8, 496, 6, 1892, 50, 388, 36, 21, 426, 8, 61, 1125, 1422, 124, 215, 1570, 226, 475, 45, 6, 223, 3, 665, 61, 1, 32548, 25720, 27194, 35, 312, 3158, 548, 234, 3998, 4, 26, 546, 3, 61, 1125, 760, 1, 3, 45, 509, 3, 715, 61, 1, 32548, 25720, 9, 3, 451, 1, 209, 2, 367, 4, 3, 61, 1422, 124, 7, 103, 32548, 25720, 504, 36, 1552, 66, 709, 415, 3, 3261, 7, 11, 625, 9, 1146, 36, 7551, 634, 9, 1552, 259, 244, 169, 61, 148, 1, 32548, 25720, 11, 409, 614, 431, 2, 424, 81, 188, 18, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 3, 461, 51, 116, 1735, 3, 568, 1387, 159, 3, 654, 1, 51, 8619, 2, 367, 8, 181, 1, 511, 7, 11, 73, 326, 190, 61, 1125, 2, 269, 190, 61, 1422, 104, 61, 817, 155, 10, 164, 28, 424, 81, 188, 18, 88, 27, 672, 3482, 1751, 673, 431, 81, 188, 18, 10, 715, 9, 3, 61, 1422, 124, 365, 7, 2402, 36, 408, 1, 290, 281, 1477, 3, 96, 186, 1477, 11, 8417, 1172, 2, 1218, 1, 3, 269, 859, 7, 73, 28, 3, 715, 61, 39, 42, 8, 34, 51, 661, 1735, 75, 3, 5032, 596, 243, 33, 493, 307, 268, 213, 18, 587, 49, 3, 8619, 10, 14, 83, 53, 184, 14, 33, 49, 53, 408, 1, 46, 99, 3, 45, 10, 9771, 2402, 32548, 25720, 10, 149, 421, 84, 10, 41, 5, 8, 154, 38, 51, 116, 4, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 62]",1723.0,26775883,Phase II Coltuximab Ravtansine SAR3419 Monotherapy Patients Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,6,0.006557377049180328

Prognostic impact of persistent cytogenetic abnormalities at complete remission in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-02-09,"In acute myelogenous leukemia, the persistent detection of abnormal cytogenetics at complete remission (ACCR) is associated with inferior outcomes. However, the prognostic significance of ACCR in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unknown. We evaluated 272 adult patients with ALL and abnormal cytogenetics at baseline who were treated with frontline induction chemotherapy, achieved complete remission (CR) and had cytogenetic analysis performed at the time of CR. ACCR was observed in 26 patients (9.6%). Median relapse-free survival was 22 months (95% CI, 12 months to not reached) for patients with ACCR vs. 48 months (range, 30-125 months) in patients with normal cytogenetics at CR (NCCR; P = 0.31). Median overall survival also did not differ significantly between the ACCR (99 months [range, 17 months to not reached]) and NCCR groups (67 months [range, 47 months to not reached], P = 0.86). The specificity of ACCR for minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity by multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) was 43%, and there was overall poor correlation between these two methods for the detection of residual disease.

Clin. Oncol.,2016-02-08,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with CNS-directed chemotherapy are at risk for neurocognitive deficits. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the neurodevelopmental trajectory in this vulnerable population. Patients enrolled in the St. Jude Total Therapy Study XV, which omitted prophylactic cranial radiation therapy in all patients, completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessments at induction (n = 142), end of maintenance (n = 243), and 2 years after completion of therapy (n = 211). We report on longitudinal change in neurocognitive function and predictors of neurocognitive outcomes 2 years after completing therapy. Neurocognitive function was largely age appropriate 2 years after completing therapy; however, the overall group demonstrated significant attention deficits and a significantly greater frequency of learning problems as compared with national normative data (all P ≤ .005). Higher-intensity CNS-directed chemotherapy conferred elevated risk for difficulties in attention, processing speed, and academics (all P ≤ .01). The rate and direction of change in performance and caregiver-reported attention difficulties differed significantly by age at diagnosis and sex. End-of-therapy attention problems predicted lower academic scores 2 years later, with small to moderate effect sizes (│r│= 0.17 to 0.25, all P ≤ .05). Two years after chemotherapy-only treatment, neurocognitive function is largely age appropriate. Nonetheless, survivors remain at elevated risk for attention problems that impact real-world functioning. Attention problems at the end of therapy predicted decreased academics 2 years later, suggesting an amplified functional impact of discrete neurocognitive difficulties.

We describe four different rearrangements of the erythropoietin receptor gene EPOR in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL. All of these rearrangements result in truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of EPOR at residues similar to those mutated in primary familial congenital polycythemia, with preservation of the proximal tyrosine essential for receptor activation and loss of distal regulatory residues. This resulted in deregulated EPOR expression, hypersensitivity to erythropoietin stimulation, and heightened JAK-STAT activation. Expression of truncated EPOR in mouse B cell progenitors induced ALL in vivo. Human leukemic cells with EPOR rearrangements were sensitive to JAK-STAT inhibition, suggesting a therapeutic option in high-risk ALL.

NUDT15 polymorphisms alter thiopurine metabolism and hematopoietic toxicity.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-02-15,"Widely used as anticancer and immunosuppressive agents, thiopurines have narrow therapeutic indices owing to frequent toxicities, partly explained by TPMT genetic polymorphisms. Recent studies identified germline NUDT15 variation as another critical determinant of thiopurine intolerance, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the clinical implications of this pharmacogenetic association remain unknown. In 270 children enrolled in clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Guatemala, Singapore and Japan, we identified four NUDT15 coding variants (p.Arg139Cys, p.Arg139His, p.Val18Ile and p.Val18_Val19insGlyVal) that resulted in 74.4-100% loss of nucleotide diphosphatase activity. Loss-of-function NUDT15 diplotypes were consistently associated with thiopurine intolerance across the three cohorts (P = 0.021, 2.1 × 10(-5) and 0.0054, respectively; meta-analysis P = 4.45 × 10(-8), allelic effect size = -11.5). Mechanistically, NUDT15 inactivated thiopurine metabolites and decreased thiopurine cytotoxicity in vitro, and patients with defective NUDT15 alleles showed excessive levels of thiopurine active metabolites and toxicity.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has identified AYA cancer patients as a unique population. The most common cancers in this age group include tumors typically seen in pediatric patients such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and brain tumors, as well as cancers more typically seen in adult patients such as breast cancer and melanoma. In addition, some cancers have their highest incidence in AYA patients, such as Hodgkin Lymphoma, testicular cancer, and bone tumors. AYA patients face additional unique issues due to their age, not just questions about treatment choices due to lack of data but also questions about fertility, relationships, loss of autonomy, and interruptions in school/work with potentially significant financial complications. This age group also has very high rates of social media usage with up to 90 % of adults aged 18 to 29 using social networking sites.

Dietary Protein Intake and Lean Muscle Mass in Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Report From the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study.,Physical therapy,Phys Ther,2016-02-18,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for low lean muscle mass and muscle weakness, which may contribute to inactivity and early development of chronic diseases typically seen in older adults. Although increasing protein intake, in combination with resistance training, improves lean muscle mass in other populations, it is not known whether muscular tissue among survivors of ALL, whose impairments are treatment-related, will respond similarly. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations among dietary protein intake, resistance training, and lean muscle mass in survivors of ALL and age-, sex-, and race-matched controls. This was a cross-sectional study. Lean muscle mass was determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, dietary information with 24-hour recalls, and participation in resistance training with a questionnaire. Participants were 365 survivors of ALL (52% male; 87% white; median age=28.5 years, range=23.6-31.7) and 365 controls with no previous cancer. Compared with controls, survivors of ALL had lower lean muscle mass (55.0 versus 57.2 kg, respectively) and lower percentage of lean muscle mass (68.6% versus 71.4%, respectively) than controls. Similar proportions of survivors (71.1%) and controls (69.7%) met recommended dietary protein intake (0.8 g/kg/d). Survivors (45.4%) were less likely to report resistance training than controls (53.8%). In adjusted models, 1-g higher protein intake per kilogram of body mass per day was associated with a 7.9% increase and resistance training ≥1×wk, with a 2.8% increase in lean muscle mass. The cross-sectional study design limits temporal evaluation of the association between protein intake and lean muscle mass. The findings suggest that survivors of childhood ALL with low lean muscle mass may benefit from optimizing dietary protein intake in combination with resistance training. Research is needed to determine whether resistance training with protein supplementation improves lean muscle mass in survivors of childhood ALL.",Journal Article,1433.0,2.0,Survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk low lean muscle mass muscle weakness contribute inactivity early development chronic diseases typically seen older adults increasing intake combination resistance training improves lean muscle mass populations known muscular tissue survivors impairments treatment-related respond similarly aim evaluate associations dietary intake resistance training lean muscle mass survivors age- sex- race-matched controls cross-sectional Lean muscle mass determined dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry dietary information 24-hour recalls participation resistance training questionnaire Participants 365 survivors 52 male 87 white median age=28.5 years range=23.6-31.7 365 controls previous Compared controls survivors lower lean muscle mass 55.0 versus 57.2 respectively lower percentage lean muscle mass 68.6 versus 71.4 respectively controls Similar proportions survivors 71.1 controls 69.7 met recommended dietary intake 0.8 g/kg/d Survivors 45.4 likely report resistance training controls 53.8 adjusted models 1-g higher intake kilogram body mass day associated 7.9 increase resistance training ≥1×wk 2.8 increase lean muscle mass cross-sectional design limits temporal evaluation association intake lean muscle mass findings suggest survivors childhood low lean muscle mass benefit optimizing dietary intake combination resistance training Research needed determine resistance training supplementation improves lean muscle mass survivors childhood,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 28, 43, 9, 154, 6949, 1502, 782, 2, 1502, 6408, 92, 68, 1248, 6, 10050, 2, 191, 193, 1, 442, 1342, 1969, 527, 4, 434, 857, 242, 602, 178, 1514, 4, 150, 5, 251, 1741, 1804, 6949, 1502, 782, 4, 127, 1184, 192, 16, 44, 440, 317, 8620, 246, 107, 332, 1, 62, 1310, 6948, 32, 24, 139, 303, 1892, 1813, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 685, 107, 2013, 178, 1514, 251, 1741, 2, 6949, 1502, 782, 4, 332, 1, 62, 2, 89, 1035, 2, 1047, 655, 535, 26, 10, 8, 1383, 2832, 45, 6949, 1502, 782, 10, 509, 5, 1828, 2803, 1006, 5520, 14257, 2013, 487, 5, 259, 2583, 29108, 2, 2599, 4, 251, 1741, 5, 8, 1770, 776, 11, 7405, 332, 1, 62, 653, 1045, 912, 886, 52, 89, 339, 33, 60, 184, 382, 49, 456, 67, 2, 7405, 535, 5, 77, 698, 12, 72, 5, 535, 332, 1, 62, 42, 280, 6949, 1502, 782, 614, 13, 185, 696, 18, 503, 106, 2, 280, 1150, 1, 6949, 1502, 782, 806, 49, 185, 792, 39, 106, 76, 535, 288, 4117, 1, 332, 792, 14, 2, 535, 790, 67, 543, 793, 2013, 178, 1514, 13, 66, 499, 503, 427, 332, 512, 39, 11, 299, 322, 6, 414, 251, 1741, 76, 535, 699, 66, 4, 586, 274, 14, 499, 142, 178, 1514, 379, 6543, 1, 642, 782, 379, 218, 10, 41, 5, 8, 67, 83, 344, 2, 251, 1741, 67662, 5, 8, 18, 66, 344, 4, 6949, 1502, 782, 3, 1383, 2832, 45, 771, 3526, 3264, 451, 1, 3, 248, 59, 178, 1514, 2, 6949, 1502, 782, 3, 272, 309, 17, 332, 1, 864, 62, 5, 154, 6949, 1502, 782, 68, 247, 29, 4336, 2013, 178, 1514, 4, 150, 5, 251, 1741, 389, 16, 575, 6, 223, 317, 251, 1741, 5, 178, 3890, 1804, 6949, 1502, 782, 4, 332, 1, 864, 62]",1975.0,26893509,Dietary Intake Lean Muscle Mass Survivors Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Report St. Jude Lifetime Cohort,168,0.18360655737704917
Ezh2 Controls an Early Hematopoietic Program and Growth and Survival Signaling in Early T Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Cell reports,Cell Rep,2016-02-18,"Early T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is an aggressive subtype of ALL distinguished by stem-cell-associated and myeloid transcriptional programs. Inactivating alterations of Polycomb repressive complex 2 components are frequent in human ETP-ALL, but their functional role is largely undefined. We have studied the involvement of Ezh2 in a murine model of NRASQ61K-driven leukemia that recapitulates phenotypic and transcriptional features of ETP-ALL. Homozygous inactivation of Ezh2 cooperated with oncogenic NRASQ61K to accelerate leukemia onset. Inactivation of Ezh2 accentuated expression of genes highly expressed in human ETP-ALL and in normal murine early thymic progenitors. Moreover, we found that Ezh2 contributes to the silencing of stem-cell- and early-progenitor-cell-associated genes. Loss of Ezh2 also resulted in increased activation of STAT3 by tyrosine 705 phosphorylation. Our data mechanistically link Ezh2 inactivation to stem-cell-associated transcriptional programs and increased growth/survival signaling, features that convey an adverse prognosis in patients.

Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Timing of Relapse and Overall Survival for Children Treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocols (2000-2010).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-02-23,"Population-based evidence suggests that lower socioeconomic status (SES) negatively impacts the overall survival (OS) of children with leukemia; however, the relationships between SES and treatment-related mortality, relapse, and timing of relapse remain unclear. We examined OS, event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence (CI) and timing of relapse by community-level poverty for 575 children aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on consecutive phase III multicenter Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocols between 2000 and 2010. Children were categorized into high- and low-poverty areas for the analysis using aggregate U.S. Census data linked to zip code. Children living in high-poverty areas experienced a 5-year OS of 85% as compared with 92% for those in low-poverty areas (P = 0.02); poverty remained marginally significant (P = 0.07) after adjustment for immunophenotype, age, and white blood cell count. There were no differences detected in EFS or CI relapse by poverty area. However, 92% of the relapses observed in children from high-poverty areas occurred <36 months from complete remission, compared to 48% of those in children from low-poverty areas (P = 0.008).

Consensus expert recommendations for identification and management of asparaginase hypersensitivity and silent inactivation.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2016-03-01,"L-asparaginase is an integral component of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, asparaginase-related complications, including the development of hypersensitivity reactions, can limit its use in individual patients. Of considerable concern in the setting of clinical allergy is the development of neutralizing antibodies and associated asparaginase inactivity. Also problematic in the use of asparaginase is the potential for the development of silent inactivation, with the formation of neutralizing antibodies and reduced asparaginase activity in the absence of a clinically evident allergic reaction. Here we present guidelines for the identification and management of clinical hypersensitivity and silent inactivation with Escherichia coli- and Erwinia chrysanthemi- derived asparaginase preparations. These guidelines were developed by a consensus panel of experts following a review of the available published data. We provide a consensus of expert opinions on the role of serum asparaginase level assessment, indications for switching asparaginase preparation, and monitoring after change in asparaginase preparation.

Modifiable Factors Associated With Aging Phenotypes Among Adult Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-03-21,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for low bone mineral density (BMD) and frail health, outcomes potentially modifiable by altering health behaviors and/or treating endocrine abnormalities. We evaluated associations between lifestyle and hormonal deficits with risk of low BMD and frailty among survivors of ALL. Participants included 862 survivors of ALL (median age, 31.3 years [range, 18.4 to 59.7 years]) enrolled in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort study. Bone density was measured using quantitative computed tomography of L1 through L2 vertebrae; low BMD was defined as an age- and sex-standardized z score < -1. The presence of frailty or prefrailty was defined as having at least two of the following: low muscle mass, self-reported exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow walking speed, and weakness. Hormonal deficiencies were determined according to medical history, medications, and laboratory findings (insulin-like growth factor 1, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone levels). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, and activity levels) and deficiencies in growth hormone (GHD) and/or sex steroids with low BMD and frailty. Thirty percent of survivors met criteria for low BMD, and 18.6% for frailty/prefrailty. After adjusting for body mass index, low BMD was associated with GHD (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.13) and current smoking (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.85) among men; and GHD (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.78) and moderate alcohol consumption (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.83) among women. After adjusting for current age, the odds of frailty/prefrailty were increased among men with GHD (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.56 to 5.67) and those who smoked (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.65 to 6.43); there were no significant associations among women.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-04-01,"The prognostic relevance of cytogenetics at diagnosis on the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 333 adult ALL patients who underwent alloHCT at our institution over a 10-year period. Patients were classified according to disease status at transplantation (complete response [CR] 1 [n = 202] or > CR1) and according to cytogenetic risk, defined as good (2%), intermediate (42%), poor (46%), or unknown (10%) based on available outcome data for each of the cytogenetic abnormalities. Three-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), and relapse incidence (RI) were 55.7%, 47.9% and 27.5%, respectively; 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 17.3%. For patients undergoing alloHCT in CR1, 3-year OS, LFS, and RI were 69.8%, 62.3%, and 17.1%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, cytogenetic risk did not impact OS or LFS for the whole cohort or for patients who underwent transplantation in CR1. Disease status at alloHCT was an independent predictor for LFS (CR1 versus others: hazard ratio [HR], 3.17; P < .01) and OS (CR1 versus others: HR, 2.90; P < .01).

Clinical and Genetic Risk Factors for Acute Pancreatitis in Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-04-25,"Acute pancreatitis is one of the common causes of asparaginase intolerance. The mechanism is unknown, and genetic predisposition to asparaginase-induced pancreatitis has not been previously identified. To determine clinical risk factors for asparaginase-induced pancreatitis, we studied a cohort of 5,185 children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, including 117 (2.3%) who were diagnosed with at least one episode of acute pancreatitis during therapy. A genome-wide association study was performed in the cohort and in an independent case-control group of 213 patients to identify genetic risk factors. Risk factors associated with pancreatitis included genetically defined Native American ancestry (P < .001), older age (P < .001), and higher cumulative dose of asparaginase (P < .001). No common variants reached genome-wide significance in the genome-wide association study, but a rare nonsense variant rs199695765 in CPA2, encoding carboxypeptidase A2, was highly associated with pancreatitis (hazard ratio, 587; 95% CI, 66.8 to 5166; P = 9.0 × 10(-9)). A gene-level analysis showed an excess of additional CPA2 variants in patients who did versus those who did not develop pancreatitis (P = .001). Sixteen CPA2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated (P < .05) with pancreatitis, and 13 of 24 patients who carried at least one of these variants developed pancreatitis.

Blinatumomab treatment of older adults with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Results from 2 phase 2 studies.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-05-03,"Older adults with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) are reported to have a poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. In the current study, the authors evaluated treatment with single-agent blinatumomab in adults aged ≥65 years with r/r ALL. A total of 261 adults with r/r ALL who were examined across two phase 2 studies received blinatumomab in cycles of 4-week continuous infusion and 2-week treatment-free intervals. The primary endpoint in each study was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) during the first 2 cycles. Data were pooled and analyzed according to patient age at screening (aged ≥65 years vs aged <65 years). Of 36 older adults, 56% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 38%-72%) achieved CR/CRh during the first 2 cycles compared with 46% (225 patients) (95% CI, 40%-53%) of younger adults. Complete minimal residual disease responses were 60% in older and 70% in younger responders. Three older responders (15%) and 61 younger responders (59%) proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Kaplan-Meier curves overlapped for relapse-free and overall survival for both age groups. Older adults were found to have a similar incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) as younger adults (86% vs 80%) but more grade ≥3 neurologic events (28% vs 13%). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 7 older (19%) (1 case of grade 3) and 23 younger (10%) (4 cases of grade ≥3) adults. There were no treatment-related fatal AEs reported. Older adults with r/r ALL who were treated with single-agent blinatumomab were found to have similar hematologic response rates and incidence of grade ≥3 AEs compared with younger adults but had more neurologic events, which were reversible and primarily resolved with treatment interruption.

Allogeneic transplantation is not superior to chemotherapy in most patients over 40 years of age with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-06-03,"Survival of patients ≥40 years of age with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor with current therapeutic approaches. It is unknown whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission confers a survival benefit compared to a chemotherapy-only approach. We retrospectively compared the outcome of patients >40 years treated with HSCT or chemotherapy alone in first remission (n = 40 in each cohort). Three-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were not significantly different between the chemotherapy-only and HSCT groups (OS, 46% [31-68] vs. 40% [27-59], P = 0.35; DFS, 31% [18-52] vs. 40% [27-59], P = 0.98). The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 61% [41-76] and 9% [2-21] for the chemotherapy-only group and 28% [15-43] and 32% [17-47] for the transplant group (CIR, P = 0.011; NRM, P = 0.014). Allogeneic transplantation for patients ≥40 years with Ph-negative ALL in first remission is associated with a lower CIR, but this benefit is offset by considerable NRM as compared with chemotherapy-only approach. HSCT may be beneficial in patients with high-risk disease features. Am. J.

Evofosfamide (TH-302) has exhibited specific hypoxia-dependent cytotoxicity against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples in vitro. Based on these findings, a Phase I study of evofosfamide was designed for patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia (NCT01149915). In this open-label study, patients were treated with evofosfamide as a 30-60 min/day infusion on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle (Arm A, n = 38) or as a continuous infusion over 120 hr over Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle (Arm B, n = 11). Forty-nine patients were treated including 39 (80%) with AML and 9 (18%) with ALL. Patients had received a median of five prior therapies. In Arm A, the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 esophagitis, observed at a dose of 550 mg/m(2) . The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was a daily dose of 460 mg/m(2) . In Arm B, the DLTs were grade 3 stomatitis and hyperbilirubinemia, observed at a daily dose of 460 mg/m(2) . The continuous infusion MTD was a daily dose of 330 mg/m(2) . Hypoxia markers HIF-1α and CAIX were highly expressed in leukemic bone marrow and were significantly reduced after evofosfamide therapy. The combined overall response rate in Arms A and B was 6% (2 CR/CRi and 1 PR), with all responses seen in Arm A. Evofosfamide has shown limited activity in heavily pretreated leukemia patients.

Phase 2 study of intensified chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-05-12,"Outcomes among older patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia remain poor. This study sought to determine the efficacy of an intensified, multi-agent approach derived from a Dana-Farber consortium trial in younger adults for patients older than 50 years (trial identifier NCT00973752). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) at 1 year. Patients received induction chemotherapy with vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, and pegylated asparaginase. Imatinib was incorporated for Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease. After induction, the first consolidation incorporated clofarabine. Patients in remission could proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after induction and consolidation I. Those not receiving HCT went on to receive central nervous system, consolidation II, and continuation phases of treatment. Thirty patients were enrolled: 19 achieved a complete remission (CR) after induction and 1 achieved CR after consolidation I for a CR rate of 67%. Sixteen patients underwent HCT. The proportion surviving at 1 year was 63%, and this met the primary endpoint. The 2-year OS rate was 52% (n = 30), and the 2-year disease-free survival rate was 52% for patients achieving CR (n = 20). There was no survival advantage among those undergoing HCT. Therapy-related hyperbilirubinemia prompted adjustments and limitations to asparaginase dosing. Intensified chemotherapy can result in improved outcomes in comparison with historical data. Additional studies of similarly intensive regimens are warranted in this population.

"Final results of a single institution experience with a pediatric-based regimen, the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster, in adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and comparison to the hyper-CVAD regimen.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-06-30,"Several studies reported improved outcomes of adolescents and young adults (AYA) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with pediatric-based ALL regimens. This prompted the prospective investigation of a pediatric Augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (ABFM) regimen, and its comparison with hyper-fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) in AYA patients. One hundred and six AYA patients (median age 22 years) with Philadelphia chromosome- (Ph) negative ALL received ABFM from October 2006 through March 2014. Their outcome was compared to 102 AYA patients (median age 27 years), treated with hyper-CVAD at our institution. The complete remission (CR) rate was 93% with ABFM and 98% with hyper-CVAD. The 5-year complete remission duration (CRD) were 53 and 55%, respectively (P = 0.98). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 60 and 60%, respectively. The MRD status on Day 29 and Day 84 of therapy was predictive of long-term outcomes on both ABFM and hyper-CVAD. Severe regimen toxicities with ABFM included hepatotoxicity in 41%, pancreatitis in 11%, osteonecrosis in 9%, and thrombosis in 19%. Myelosuppression-associated complications were most significant with hyper-CVAD. In summary, ABFM and hyper-CVAD resulted in similar efficacy outcomes, but were associated with different toxicity profiles, asparaginase-related with ABFM and myelosuppression-related with hyper-CVAD.

The Role of Leukapheresis in the Current Management of Hyperleukocytosis in Newly Diagnosed Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-05-17,"Hyperleukocytosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been associated with early morbidity and mortality. The use of leukapheresis in these children treated with contemporary therapy remains controversial. We analyzed clinical data from patients enrolled onto frontline protocols for ALL (Total Therapy XV and XVI) between 2003 and 2014. We documented adverse events within the first 14 days in patients with a white blood cell (WBC) count ≥200 × 10(9) /l and reviewed their management. Fifty-three (7.8%) of 678 consecutive pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL presented with hyperleukocytosis (median WBC count 393 × 10(9) /l; range 200-1,014). Two deaths in patients without initial hyperleukocytosis occurred within the first 2 weeks from diagnosis secondary to bacterial sepsis. A total of 21 (40%) patients with ALL and hyperleukocytosis developed grade 3 or 4 adverse events regardless of the use of leukapheresis (P > 0.99 and P = 0.19). Sixteen of 53 (30%) patients with ALL received low-dose chemotherapy for leukocytoreduction initially. One-third of patients received urate oxidase, and none of the patients with hyperleukocytosis required hemodialysis.

Characterization of leukemias with ETV6-ABL1 fusion.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2016-05-26,"To characterize the incidence, clinical features and genetics of ETV6-ABL1 leukemias, representing targetable kinase-activating lesions, we analyzed 44 new and published cases of ETV6-ABL1-positive hematologic malignancies [22 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (13 children, 9 adults) and 22 myeloid malignancies (18 myeloproliferative neoplasms, 4 acute myeloid leukemias)]. The presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion was ascertained by cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing. Genomic and gene expression profiling was performed by single nucleotide polymorphism and expression arrays. Systematic screening of more than 4,500 cases revealed that in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ETV6-ABL1 is rare in childhood (0.17% cases) and slightly more common in adults (0.38%). There is no systematic screening of myeloproliferative neoplasms; however, the number of ETV6-ABL1-positive cases and the relative incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms suggest that in adulthood ETV6-ABL1 is more common in BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloid leukemia-like myeloproliferations than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The genomic profile of ETV6-ABL1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia resembled that of BCR-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1-like cases with 80% of patients having concurrent CDKN2A/B and IKZF1 deletions. In the gene expression profiling all the ETV6-ABL1-positive samples clustered in close vicinity to BCR-ABL1 cases. All but one of the cases of ETV6-ABL1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia were classified as BCR-ABL1-like by a standardized assay.

Impact of complete molecular response on survival in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-05-27,"The impact of achieving complete molecular response (CMR) in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains undefined. We evaluated the impact of CMR on outcomes among 85 patients with Ph(+) ALL who received first-line hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had minimal residual disease (MRD) assessments for BCR-ABL1 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction at complete remission (CR) and at 3-month time points, and did not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). MRD status at 3 months had better discrimination for overall survival (OS; P = .005) and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .002) than did MRD status at CR (P = .11 and P = .04, respectively). At 3 months, achievement of CMR vs response less than CMR was associated with longer median OS (127 vs 38 months, respectively; P = .009) and RFS (126 vs 18 months, respectively; P = .007). By multivariate analysis, only CMR at 3 months was prognostic for OS (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.82; P = .01).

Incorporating measurable ('minimal') residual disease-directed treatment strategies to optimize outcomes in adults with acute myeloid leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2016-07-01,"Curative-intent therapy leads to complete remissions in many adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but relapse remains common. Numerous studies have unequivocally demonstrated that the persistence of measurable ('minimal') residual disease (MRD) at the submicroscopic level during morphologic remission identifies patients at high risk of disease recurrence and short survival. This association has provided the impetus to customize anti-leukemia therapy based on MRD data, a strategy that is now routinely pursued in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While it is currently uncertain whether this approach will improve outcomes in AML other than APL, randomized studies have validated MRD-based risk-stratified treatment algorithms in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Chemotherapy Pharmacodynamics and Neuroimaging and Neurocognitive Outcomes in Long-Term Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-06-06,"To examine associations among methotrexate pharmacodynamics, neuroimaging, and neurocognitive outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol. This longitudinal study linked pharmacokinetic assays collected during therapy to neurocognitive and brain imaging outcomes during long-term follow-up. A total of 218 (72.2%) of 302 eligible long-term survivors were recruited for outcome studies when they were more than 5 years post-diagnosis and older than 8 years of age. At long-term follow-up, survivors were an average of 13.8 years old and 7.7 years from diagnosis, and 51% were male. Neurocognitive testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during an executive function task, and structural MRI with diffusion tensor imaging were conducted. Generalized linear models were developed to identify predictors, and models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, and parent education. Intelligence was within normal limits (mean, 98; standard deviation, 14) compared with population expectations (mean, 100; standard deviation, 15), though measures of executive function, processing speed, and memory were less than population means (all P < .02 after correction for false discovery rates). Higher plasma concentration of methotrexate was associated with a poorer executive function score (P < .02). Higher plasma methotrexate was also associated with higher functional MRI activity, with thicker cortices in dorsolateral prefrontal brain regions, and with white matter microstructure in the frontostriatal tact.

Inotuzumab Ozogamicin versus Standard Therapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2016-06-12,"The prognosis for adults with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia is poor. We sought to determine whether inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, results in better outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia than does standard therapy. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia to receive either inotuzumab ozogamicin (inotuzumab ozogamicin group) or standard intensive chemotherapy (standard-therapy group). The primary end points were complete remission (including complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) and overall survival. Of the 326 patients who underwent randomization, the first 218 (109 in each group) were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis of complete remission. The rate of complete remission was significantly higher in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group than in the standard-therapy group (80.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 72.1 to 87.7] vs. 29.4% [95% CI, 21.0 to 38.8], P<0.001). Among the patients who had complete remission, a higher percentage in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (0.01% marrow blasts) (78.4% vs. 28.1%, P<0.001); the duration of remission was longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 4.6 months [95% CI, 3.9 to 5.4] vs. 3.1 months [95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9]; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96]; P=0.03). In the survival analysis, which included all 326 patients, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 5.0 months [95% CI, 3.7 to 5.6] vs. 1.8 months [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2]; hazard ratio, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34 to 0.61]; P<0.001); the median overall survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.0 to 9.2) versus 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 8.3), and the hazard ratio was 0.77 (97.5% CI, 0.58 to 1.03) (P=0.04). In the safety population, the most frequent grade 3 or higher nonhematologic adverse events with inotuzumab ozogamicin were liver-related. Veno-occlusive liver disease of any grade occurred in 15 patients (11%) who received inotuzumab ozogamicin and in 1 patient (1%) who received standard therapy. The rate of complete remission was higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin than with standard therapy, and a higher percentage of patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease. Both progression-free and overall survival were longer with inotuzumab ozogamicin. Veno-occlusive liver disease was a major adverse event associated with inotuzumab ozogamicin.

We present the demographic characteristics and nutrient intake at study entry of a prospective cohort in which evaluating dietary intake in children diagnosed with ALL was investigated. Dietary intake data were collected for participants enrolled on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol. Dietary intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire and was compared with the dietary reference intake by ALL risk group (standard and high risk). Dietary intake data were collected from 81% of participants (n = 640). We found that 27% of participants were overweight/obese. Intake of total calories and other nutrients exceeded the dietary reference intake in up to 79% of children. This was evident in both risk groups and was pronounced among younger children. For micronutrients, dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D (females only), and zinc differed significantly between patients with standard-risk and those with high-risk ALL. This study was successful in collecting dietary intake data at the time of cancer diagnosis in a multicenter setting in a pediatric population at high-risk for nutrition-related morbidity.

Long-Term Efficacy of Computerized Cognitive Training Among Survivors of Childhood Cancer: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.,Journal of pediatric psychology,J Pediatr Psychol,2017-03-01,"To investigate the long-term efficacy of computerized cognitive training in improving cognitive outcomes among childhood cancer survivors. Sixty-eight survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT) were randomly assigned to computerized cognitive intervention (23 ALL/11 BT, age = 12.21 ± 2.47) or a waitlist control group (24 ALL/10 BT, age = 11.82 ± 2.42). Cognitive assessments were completed pre-, immediately post-, and 6 months postintervention.

Uric Acid and Neurocognitive Function in Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated with Chemotherapy Only.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2016-06-26,"Hyperuricemia is implicated in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. This study evaluated associations between uric acid (UA), cardiovascular health, and neurocognitive function in adolescent and adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy only. 126 adolescent [mean (SD) age 14.6 (5.0); 7.8 (1.7) years postdiagnosis] and 226 adult survivors [age 25.4 (4.2) years; 18.1 (4.4) years postdiagnosis] completed comprehensive neurocognitive testing. Concurrent UA measurements were conducted for both groups. For adult survivors, cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, and UA measurements during adolescence [12.3 (4.0) years before neurocognitive testing] were also collected. UA levels were categorized into quartiles for age- and gender-based ranking, and associations with neurocognitive outcomes were examined. Survivors demonstrated worse attention, processing speed, and executive functions than population norms (P values < 0.05). Adolescent survivors with elevated UA had poorer attention (P = 0.04), visual-processing speed (P = 0.03), and cognitive flexibility (P = 0.02). UA was not associated with neurocognitive outcomes in adult survivors. Adult survivors developed dyslipidemia (46%), hypertension (32%), and abdominal obesity (26%), and high UA during adolescence was associated with these cardiovascular risk factors as adults (all P values < 0.01). Fine-motor processing speed was slower in adult survivors with dyslipidemia (P = 0.04) and abdominal obesity (P = 0.04). Poorer attention was marginally associated with hypertension (P = 0.06). Elevated UA is associated with neurocognitive performance in adolescent survivors. In adult survivors, relative elevation of UA during adolescence was predictive of cardiovascular health, which was associated with poorer neurocognitive outcomes. Future studies should evaluate the mediating role of chronic cardiovascular health conditions between elevated UA and subsequent neurocognitive impairment in survivors.

Dasatinib-Induced Colitis after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-06-23,"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is often used after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation to treat minimal residual disease in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Colitis, sometimes hemorrhagic, has occasionally been described with the use of dasatinib for both chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL. The pathogenesis of dasatinib-induced colitis is unclear but may be related to effects of dasatinib on immune function. We describe a series of 5 patients who had 7 episodes of colitis during dasatinib use. No patient had obvious large granular lymphocytosis in peripheral blood. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of these cases were indistinguishable from control cases of gut graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In all patients symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of dasatinib in addition to therapy with local or low-dose systemic steroids. An additional 3 patients who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis while on dasatinib therapy were identified and studied. Dasatinib colitis may have an immune-mediated mechanism similar to GVHD, and dasatinib use may be associated with CMV colitis.

Biol.,2016-06-27,"T cells kill microbial-infected and malignant cells by detection of nonself antigens with the TCR. Tumor reactivity can be encoded genetically by introducing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells. CARs are composed of an antigen-binding domain and an intracellular T cell activation domain. Early human trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) showed limited responses until CARs included a costimulation domain, and conditioning chemotherapy was given before T cell infusion. Clinical trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are demonstrating response rates up to 90%. However, these clinical outcomes are associated with a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is caused by T cell activation and manifests as high-grade fever, hypotension, and other cardiovascular complications. It is currently managed conservatively but can be treated with cytokine-directed therapy or with high-dose steroids. Current efforts are dedicated to confirming the clinical efficacy and managing toxicities in multicenter Phase II trials.

Genomic Profiling of Adult and Pediatric B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,2016-05-13,"Genomic landscapes of 92 adult and 111 pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were investigated using next-generation sequencing and copy number alteration analysis. Recurrent gene mutations and fusions were tested in an additional 87 adult and 93 pediatric patients. Among the 29 newly identified in-frame gene fusions, those involving MEF2D and ZNF384 were clinically relevant and were demonstrated to perturb B-cell differentiation, with EP300-ZNF384 inducing leukemia in mice. Eight gene expression subgroups associated with characteristic genetic abnormalities were identified, including leukemia with MEF2D and ZNF384 fusions in two distinct clusters. In subgroup G4 which was characterized by ERG deletion, DUX4-IGH fusion was detected in most cases. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to compare the features of molecular pathogenesis between adult and pediatric B-ALL and to identify signatures possibly related to the inferior outcome of adults to that of children. We found that, besides the known discrepancies in frequencies of prognostic markers, adult patients had more cooperative mutations and greater enrichment for alterations of epigenetic modifiers and genes linked to B-cell development, suggesting difference in the target cells of transformation between adult and pediatric patients and may explain in part the disparity in their responses to treatment.

We assessed how pediatric oncology providers educate families about oral chemotherapy. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 68 physicians and nurses from 9 institutions in the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Consortium. The inter-individual approach to patient education is variable and may consist of handouts, treatment calendars, and discussions. The extent of teaching often varies depending on a provider's subjective assessment of a family's needs. Twenty-five percent of providers suggested standardizing patient teaching.

Delays in postremission chemotherapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia are associated with inferior outcomes in patients who undergo allogeneic transplant: An analysis from ECOG 2993/MRC UK ALLXII.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-08-22,"Adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a poorer prognosis than children due to a high risk of relapse. One explanation may be variable adherence to dose-intense chemotherapy. However, little is known about risk factors for delays in therapy and their impact on survival. We conducted an analysis of ECOG 2993/UKALLXII trial to study delays in postremission chemotherapy in adults with newly diagnosed ALL. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for a very long delay (VLD, >4 weeks) in start of intensification therapy. Cox regression was used to evaluate the impact of delays on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). We evaluated 1076 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients who completed induction chemotherapy, achieved complete remission, and started intensification. Factors independently associated with VLD included duration of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, P < 0.001) during Phase I; thrombocytopenia during Phase I (OR = 1.16, P = 0.004) or Phase II (OR 1.13, P = 0.001); chemotherapy dose reductions during Induction Phase I (OR = 1.72, P < 0.014); female sex (OR = 1.53, P = 0.010); Black (OR = 3.24, P = 0.003) and Asian (OR = 2.26, P = 0.021) race; and increasing age (OR = 1.31, P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox regression, patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloHCT) had significantly worse OS (HR 1.4, P = 0.03) and EFS (HR 1.4, P = 0.02) after experiencing a VLD compared to alloHCT patients who experienced ≤4 weeks delay. Specific populations (female, older, Black, and Asian patients) were more likely to experience delays in chemotherapy, as were those with significant toxicity during induction. VLDs in therapy negatively affected outcomes in patients undergoing allografting. Am. J.

Hyper-CVAD plus ponatinib versus hyper-CVAD plus dasatinib as frontline therapy for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A propensity score analysis.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-01,"The clinical efficacy of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (HCVAD) plus ponatinib has not been compared with that of HCVAD plus dasatinib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in a randomized clinical trial. The authors analyzed 110 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL who were enrolled in 2 consecutive, prospective, phase 2 clinical trials of frontline HCVAD with either dasatinib (63 patients) or ponatinib (47 patients). Propensity score analysis with 1:1 matching with the nearest neighbor matching method and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis based on the propensity scores were performed to assess response rates, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) between the cohorts. Propensity score matching identified 41 patients in each cohort. With propensity score matching, the 3-year EFS rates for patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib and HCVAD plus dasatinib were 69% and 46%, respectively (P =.04), and the 3-year OS rates were 83% and 56%, respectively (P =.03). IPTW analysis using prematching cohorts demonstrated that patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib had significantly higher rates of minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry on day 21, complete cytogenetic response at complete response, major molecular response at complete response and at 3 months, and complete molecular response at 3 months. IPTW confirmed that treatment with HCVAD plus ponatinib was associated with longer EFS (P =.003) and OS (P =.001) compared with treatment with HCVAD plus dasatinib. The clinical outcome of patients treated with HCVAD plus ponatinib appears to be superior to that of patients treated with HCVAD plus dasatinib among individuals with Ph+ ALL.

Phase I trials using Sleeping Beauty to generate CD19-specific CAR T cells.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2016-08-02,"T cells expressing antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) improve outcomes for CD19-expressing B cell malignancies. We evaluated a human application of T cells that were genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to express a CD19-specific CAR. T cells were genetically modified using DNA plasmids from the SB platform to stably express a second-generation CD19-specific CAR and selectively propagated ex vivo with activating and propagating cells (AaPCs) and cytokines. Twenty-six patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia safely underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and infusion of CAR T cells as adjuvant therapy in the autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic settings (n = 19). SB-mediated genetic transposition and stimulation resulted in 2,200- to 2,500-fold ex vivo expansion of genetically modified T cells, with 84% CAR expression, and without integration hotspots. Following autologous HSCT, the 30-month progression-free and overall survivals were 83% and 100%, respectively. After allogeneic HSCT, the respective 12-month rates were 53% and 63%. No acute or late toxicities and no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease were observed. Despite a low antigen burden and unsupportive recipient cytokine environment, CAR T cells persisted for an average of 201 days for autologous recipients and 51 days for allogeneic recipients. CD19-specific CAR T cells generated with SB and AaPC platforms were safe, and may provide additional cancer control as planned infusions after HSCT.

Prognostic significance of day 14 bone marrow evaluation in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-10,"The role of day 14 (D14) bone marrow (BM) assessment in detecting increased blasts in patients undergoing induction for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is not well defined. This study evaluated 389 adolescent and adult patients with previously untreated Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL who received frontline induction chemotherapy and for whom a D14 BM assessment was performed. A D14 BM blast proportion < 10% (including blast-free aplastic BM) was observed in 319 patients (82%), 10% to 29% was observed in 31 patients (8%), and ≥30% was observed in 39 patients (10%). The composite complete remission (CR)/complete remission with inadequate platelet recovery (CRp) rates for these groups were 99.7%, 87%, and 79%, respectively. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 49, 33, and 9 months, respectively (P < .001). The median overall survival (OS) was 88, 37, and 21 months, respectively (P < .001). The D14 BM blast group was the only factor predictive for the achievement of CR/CRp (P < .001). According to a multivariate analysis, the D14 BM blast group was independently prognostic for both EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.85; P = .004) and OS (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.14-1.85; P = .003). However, when minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment at the time of CR was added to the model, the D14 BM blast group was no longer prognostic for EFS or OS. An assessment of residual D14 BM blasts in patients with ALL is highly predictive of the achievement of CR with induction chemotherapy and of EFS and OS. However, the D14 BM blast assessment is less prognostic of long-term outcomes when an MRD assessment is also available.

Differential impact of minimal residual disease negativity according to the salvage status in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-09-07,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment predicts survival for patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Its significance in relapsed/refractory ALL is less clear. This study identified 78 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL who achieved a morphologic response with inotuzumab ozogamicin (n = 41), blinatumomab (n = 11), or mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin plus inotuzumab (n = 26) during either salvage 1 (S1; n = 46) or salvage 2 (S2; n = 32) and had undergone an MRD assessment by multiparameter flow cytometry at the time of remission. MRD negativity was achieved in 41 patients overall (53%). The MRD negativity rate was 57% in S1 and 47% in S2. Among patients in S1, achieving MRD negativity was associated with longer event-free survival (EFS; median, 18 vs 7 months; 2-year EFS rate, 46% vs 17%; P = .06) and overall survival (OS; median, 27 vs 9 months; 2-year OS, 52% vs 36%; P = .15). EFS and OS were similar in S2, regardless of the MRD response. Among MRD-negative patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), EFS and OS were superior for those who underwent SCT in S1 rather than S2 (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively).

Adoption of pediatric-inspired acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens by adult oncologists treating adolescents and young adults: A population-based study.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-09-13,"Studies have demonstrated superior outcomes for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are treated using pediatric versus adult therapeutic regimens. To the best of our knowledge, whether adult oncologists in the United States have adopted this approach to ALL in AYA patients is currently unknown. The objective of the current study was to provide a population-based description of ALL treatment patterns in AYA individuals over the past decade. Data regarding AYA patients aged 15 to 39 years and diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2014 while living in the Greater Bay Area were obtained from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry (GBACR). Treating facilities were designated as pediatric or adult centers; induction treatment regimens were abstracted from registry text data fields. Of 304 patients diagnosed in the GBACR catchment region, complete treatment data were available for 229 (75%). The location of care was identified for 296 patients (97%) treated at 31 unique centers. Approximately 70% of AYA patients received induction therapy at an adult treatment center. All AYA patients who were treated at pediatric centers received pediatric ALL regimens. Among AYA patients treated by adult oncologists with complete treatment data, none received a pediatric regimen before 2008. Between 2008 and 2012, while the US Adult Intergroup C10403 pediatric-inspired ALL protocol was open to accrual, 31% of AYA patients treated by adult oncologists received pediatric regimens. This rate fell to 21% from 2013 through 2014. Adult facilities treating ≥ 2 AYA patients with ALL per year captured in the GBACR were more likely to administer pediatric regimens than lower volume centers (P = .03). As of 2014, only a minority of AYA patients with ALL received pediatric ALL regimens at adult cancer centers.

The use of Erwinia asparaginase for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after pegaspargase intolerance.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2016-08-26,"Asparaginase administration has become a crucial component of front-line pediatric and pediatric-insipired multi-agent regimens for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the safety and feasibility of switching to Erwinia asparaginase after pegaspargase intolerance in adult ALL patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Our analysis included 10 patients, with a median age of 39 years (range 20-72), male predominance (90%), and a typical B-cell to T-cell ratio (70:30%) for ALL. Nine patients were switched to Erwinia asparaginase after pegaspargase hypersensitivity and one patient after grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia secondary to pegaspargase. With Erwinia asparaginase, no hypersensitivity reactions occurred and no patient developed other known clinical asparaginase-related toxicities. Laboratory adverse effects consisted of mostly mild elevation in liver enzymes. No morphologic relapses have occurred in any patient switched to Erwinia asparaginase in first remission at a follow up of 0.4-34.6 months. These findings are unique in that all of our patients received Erwinia asparaginase after hypersensitivity or intolerance to pegaspargase and 50% of them were older than 40 years of age, a population with very limited Erwinia asparaginase data.

miR-125b regulates differentiation and metabolic reprogramming of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by directly targeting A20.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-11-01,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy. Although it has been reported that overexpression of miR-125b leads to T-ALL development, the underlying mechanisms of miR-125b action are still unclear. The goal of this study is to delineate the role of miR-125b in T-ALL development. We found that miR-125b is highly expressed in undifferentiated leukemic T cells (CD4-negative) while its expression is low in differentiated T cells (CD4-positive). Overexpression of miR-125b increased the CD4-negative population in T cells, whereas depletion of miR-125b by miR-125b-sponge decreased the CD4-negative cell population. We identified that A20 (TNFAIP3) is a direct target of miR-125b in T cells. Overexpression of miR-125b also increased glucose uptake and oxygen consumption in T cells through targeting A20. Furthermore, restoration of A20 in miR-125b-overexpressing cells decreased the CD4-negative population in T cell leukemia, and decreased glucose uptake and oxygen consumption to the basal level of T cells transfected with vector. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-125b regulates differentiation and reprogramming of T cell glucose metabolism via targeting A20.

"Buparlisib, a PI3K inhibitor, demonstrates acceptable tolerability and preliminary activity in a phase I trial of patients with advanced leukemias.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-12-07,"Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling plays a crucial role in oncogene-mediated tumor growth and proliferation. Buparlisib (BKM120) is an oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor. This phase I study was conducted to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BKM120 in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias. Fourteen pts (12 acute myeloid leukemia, 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 mixed phenotype leukemia) were enrolled. Twelve pts received BKM-120 80 mg/day and two 100 mg/day. The MTD was 80 mg/day. Of the 14 patients treated, the best response was stable disease in one patient that lasted 82 days. The median survival for all patients was 75 days (range 10-568). Three patients with a 3q26 chromosome abnormality had a significantly improved median survival of 360 days (range 278-568) as compared to a median survival of 57 days (range, 10-125) among the 11 other patients. The most frequent drug-related toxicities included confusion, mucositis, dysphagia, and fatigue.

Prognostic impact of pretreatment cytogenetics in adult Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the era of minimal residual disease.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-10-03,"The introduction of novel prognostic factors such as minimal residual disease (MRD) and genomic profiling has led to the reevaluation of the role of cytogenetics and other conventional factors in risk stratification for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study assessed the impact of baseline cytogenetics on the outcomes of 428 adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL who were receiving frontline chemotherapy. Three hundred thirty patients (77%) were treated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone-based regimens, and 98 (23%) were treated with the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster regimen. The median age was 40 years (range, 13-86 years). One hundred eighty-six patients (43%) had diploid cytogenetics, 32 (7%) had complex cytogenetics (defined as ≥ 5 chromosomal abnormalities), 27 (6%) had low hypodiploidy/near-triploidy (Ho-Tr), 24 (6%) had high hyperdiploidy, and 24 (6%) had a mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) rearrangement. Patients with an MLL rearrangement, Ho-Tr, or a complex karyotype had significantly worse relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than the diploid group. According to a multivariate analysis including all the baseline characteristics and MRD status, Ho-Tr and a complex karyotype were independent predictive factors for worse RFS and OS. Furthermore, survival among all cytogenetic groups was similar, regardless of the treatment received. A complex karyotype and Ho-Tr are adverse prognostic factors for adults with ALL independently of the MRD status. These findings suggest that pretreatment cytogenetics remain a valuable prognostic tool in this population.

Reduced intensity conditioned allograft yields favorable survival for older adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-11-12,"Older adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have poor survival. We examined the effectiveness of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) in adults with B-ALL age 55 years and older and explored prognostic factors associated with long-term outcomes. Using CIBMTR registry data, we evaluated 273 patients (median age 61, range 55-72) with B-ALL with disease status in CR1 (71%), >CR2 (17%) and Primary Induction Failure (PIF)/Relapse (11%), who underwent RIC HCT between 2001 and 2012 using mostly unrelated donor (59%) or HLA-matched sibling (32%). Among patients with available cytogenetic data, the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) was present in 50%. The 3-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 25% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 20-31%) and 47% (95% CI: 41-53%), respectively. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 38% (95% CI: 33-44%). Relapse remained the leading cause of death accounting for 49% of all deaths. In univariate analysis, 3 year risk of NRM was significantly higher with reduced Karnofsky performance status (KPS <90: 34% (95% CI: 25-43%) versus KPS ≥90 (18%; 95% CI: 12-24%, P = 0.006). Mortality was increased in older adults (66+ vs. 55-60: Relative Risk [RR] 1.51 95% CI: 1.00-2.29, P = 0.05) and those with advanced disease (RR 2.13; 95% CI: 1.36-3.34, P = 0.001). Survival of patients in CR1 yields 45% (95% CI: 38-52%) at 3 years and no relapse occurred after 2 years. We report promising OS and acceptable NRM using RIC HCT in older patients with B-ALL. Disease status in CR1 and good performance status are associated with improved outcomes. Am. J.

Feasibility of baseline neurocognitive assessment using Cogstate during the first month of therapy for childhood leukemia.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2016-10-10,"Neurocognitive impairment is frequently observed among acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors within the domains of intelligence, attention, processing speed, working memory, learning, and memory. However, few have investigated treatment-induced changes in neurocognitive function during the first months of treatment. Additionally, dysfunction during treatment may be preceded by changes in biomarkers measured within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Identification of acute declines in neurocognitive function, as well as predictive genotypes or biomarkers, could guide therapeutic trials of protective interventions. This study collects CSF while prospectively assessing neurocognitive functioning (working memory, executive function, learning, processing speed, and attention) of ALL patients using the Cogstate computerized battery at six time points during and after the 2 years of leukemia treatment on a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium trial. Baseline data collected during the first 3 weeks of induction chemotherapy indicate reliable data as all subjects (N = 34) completed Cogstate baseline testing, while completion and performance checks indicate that 100 % of subjects completed testing and complied with test requirements. The majority (85 %) exhibited normal function compared with age peers.

Marsdenia tenacissimae extraction (MTE) inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of human acute T cell leukemia cells through inactivating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via PTEN enhancement.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-12-01,"Marsdenia tenacissimae extraction (MTE) as a traditional Chinese herb has long been used to treat some diseases such as tumors in China. However, the potential effectiveness of MTE in leukemia has not yet been fully understood, and the related molecular mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of MTE on the proliferation and apoptosis of Jurkat cells (T-ALL lines) and lymphocytes from T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) patients. Firstly, CCK8 assays and flow cytometry assays revealed that MTE dose-dependently reduced the proliferation of Jurkat cells by arresting cell cycle at S phase. Secondly, Annexin V-FITC/PI-stained flow cytometry and TUNEL staining assays showed that MTE promoted the apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Mechanistically, MTE enhanced PTEN (phosphatases and tensin homolog) level and inactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in Jurkat cells, which mediated the inhibition of cell proliferation by MTE and MTE-induced apoptosis. Finally, MTE significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of lymphocytes from T-ALL patients, compared with lymphocytes from healthy peoples. Taken together, these results reveal an unrecognized function of MTE in inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of T-ALL cells, and identify a pathway of PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR for the effects of MTE on leukemia therapy.",Journal Article,1146.0,17.0,Marsdenia tenacissimae extraction MTE traditional Chinese herb long treat diseases China potential effectiveness MTE leukemia fully understood related molecular mechanism unknown present aimed evaluate effects MTE proliferation apoptosis Jurkat T-ALL lines lymphocytes T-ALL T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients Firstly CCK8 flow cytometry revealed MTE dose-dependently reduced proliferation Jurkat arresting cycle phase Secondly Annexin V-FITC/PI-stained flow cytometry TUNEL staining showed MTE promoted apoptosis Jurkat Mechanistically MTE enhanced PTEN phosphatases tensin homolog level inactivated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway Jurkat mediated inhibition proliferation MTE MTE-induced apoptosis Finally MTE significantly inhibited proliferation promoted apoptosis lymphocytes T-ALL patients compared lymphocytes healthy peoples Taken reveal unrecognized function MTE inhibiting proliferation inducing apoptosis T-ALL identify pathway PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR effects MTE leukemia therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[69194, 69195, 5763, 21866, 22, 8, 1847, 3656, 21322, 71, 319, 85, 95, 6, 943, 476, 1342, 225, 22, 57, 4, 5055, 137, 3, 174, 1236, 1, 21866, 4, 71, 44, 1145, 85, 1910, 1784, 2, 3, 139, 219, 670, 16, 1234, 860, 4, 3, 364, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 376, 3, 176, 1, 21866, 23, 3, 457, 2, 351, 1, 8433, 37, 102, 62, 285, 2, 1594, 29, 102, 62, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 7, 16535, 29844, 1013, 2, 1412, 1914, 1013, 553, 17, 21866, 61, 12968, 405, 3, 457, 1, 8433, 37, 20, 18265, 31, 417, 28, 695, 124, 18904, 4850, 603, 12990, 2928, 3386, 1412, 1914, 2, 8159, 1029, 1013, 224, 17, 21866, 2992, 3, 351, 1, 8433, 37, 4187, 21866, 651, 820, 14428, 2, 6111, 3412, 301, 2, 5458, 974, 649, 873, 314, 308, 4, 8433, 37, 92, 517, 3, 297, 1, 31, 457, 20, 21866, 2, 21866, 277, 351, 1368, 21866, 97, 879, 3, 457, 2, 2992, 3, 351, 1, 1594, 29, 102, 62, 7, 72, 5, 1594, 29, 1331, 69196, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 2396, 35, 6055, 343, 1, 21866, 4, 2062, 3, 457, 2, 1958, 3, 351, 1, 102, 62, 37, 2, 255, 8, 308, 1, 820, 974, 649, 873, 9, 3, 176, 1, 21866, 23, 36]",1347.0,27756877,Marsdenia tenacissimae extraction MTE inhibits proliferation induces apoptosis human acute leukemia inactivating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway PTEN enhancement,0,0.0
Deregulation of DUX4 and ERG in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-10-24,"Chromosomal rearrangements deregulating hematopoietic transcription factors are common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we show that deregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene DUX4 and the ETS transcription factor gene ERG is a hallmark of a subtype of B-progenitor ALL that comprises up to 7% of B-ALL. DUX4 rearrangement and overexpression was present in all cases and was accompanied by transcriptional deregulation of ERG, expression of a novel ERG isoform, ERGalt, and frequent ERG deletion. ERGalt uses a non-canonical first exon whose transcription was initiated by DUX4 binding. ERGalt retains the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of ERG, but it inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity and is transforming. These results illustrate a unique paradigm of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia in which DUX4 deregulation results in loss of function of ERG, either by deletion or induced expression of an isoform that is a dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type ERG function.",Journal Article,1184.0,68.0,Chromosomal rearrangements deregulating hematopoietic transcription factors common acute lymphoblastic leukemia deregulation homeobox transcription factor DUX4 ETS transcription factor ERG hallmark subtype B-progenitor comprises 7 B-ALL DUX4 rearrangement overexpression present cases accompanied transcriptional deregulation ERG expression novel ERG isoform ERGalt frequent ERG deletion ERGalt uses non-canonical exon transcription initiated DUX4 binding ERGalt retains DNA-binding transactivation domains ERG inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity transforming illustrate unique paradigm transcription factor deregulation leukemia DUX4 deregulation loss function ERG deletion induced expression isoform dominant-negative inhibitor wild-type ERG function,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1860, 2072, 34885, 1007, 866, 130, 32, 186, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 467, 21, 514, 17, 4765, 1, 3, 10337, 866, 161, 145, 18043, 2, 3, 4802, 866, 161, 145, 3032, 16, 8, 4683, 1, 8, 875, 1, 132, 2520, 62, 17, 6704, 126, 6, 67, 1, 132, 62, 18043, 2675, 2, 851, 10, 364, 4, 62, 140, 2, 10, 2756, 20, 1431, 4765, 1, 3032, 55, 1, 8, 229, 3032, 3995, 41583, 2, 908, 3032, 1528, 41583, 4025, 8, 220, 4471, 157, 1725, 1310, 866, 10, 1917, 20, 18043, 791, 41583, 10785, 3, 261, 791, 2, 8355, 2703, 1, 3032, 84, 192, 1576, 955, 267, 3032, 1431, 128, 2, 16, 3621, 46, 99, 4746, 8, 991, 2431, 1, 866, 161, 4765, 4, 4, 92, 18043, 4765, 99, 4, 407, 1, 343, 1, 3032, 361, 20, 1528, 15, 277, 55, 1, 35, 3995, 17, 16, 8, 2156, 199, 230, 1, 955, 267, 3032, 343]",995.0,27776115,Deregulation DUX4 ERG acute lymphoblastic leukemia,2,0.002185792349726776

Clofarabine Plus Busulfan is an Effective Conditioning Regimen for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Long-Term Study Results.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-11-02,"We investigated the long-term safety and disease control data obtained with i.v. busulfan (Bu) combined with clofarabine (Clo) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A total of 107 patients, median age 38 years (range, 19 to 64 years) received a matched sibling donor (n = 52) or matched unrelated donor (n = 55) transplant for ALL in first complete remission (n = 62), second complete remission (n = 28), or more advanced disease (n = 17). Nearly one-half of the patients had a high-risk cytogenetic profile as defined by the presence of t(9;22) (n = 34), t(4;11) (n = 4), or complex cytogenetics (n = 7). Clo 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was given once daily, with each dose followed by pharmacokinetically dosed Bu infused over 3 hours daily for 4 days, followed by hematopoietic cell infusion after 2 days of rest. The Bu dose was based on the drug clearance as determined by a test Bu dose of 32 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The target daily area under the curve was 5500 µmol/min for patients aged <60 years and 4000 µmol/min for patients aged >59 years. With a median follow-up of 3.3 years among surviving patients (range, 1 to 5.8 years), the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients undergoing HSCT in first complete remission (CR1), second complete remission (CR2), or more advanced disease was 62%, 34%, and 35%, respectively. The regimen was well tolerated, with nonrelapse mortality (NRM) of 10% at 100 days and 31% at 2 years post-HSCT. The incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 35% and 10%, respectively; 18% patients developed extensive chronic GVHD. The 2-year overall survival (OS) for patients undergoing HSCT in CR1, CR2, or more advanced disease was 70%, 57%, and 35%, respectively. Among 11 patients aged >59 years treated with reduced-dose Bu in CR1 (n = 7) or CR2 (n = 4), 4 remain alive and disease-free, with a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range, 2 to 4.7 years).

Diagnostic evaluation of RNA sequencing for the detection of genetic abnormalities associated with Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2016-11-17,"Philadelphia (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a molecular subtype of high-risk B-cell ALL characterized by formation of abnormal gene fusions involving tyrosine kinase (TK) and cytokine receptor genes and activation of TK signaling. Because of the diversity of associated genetic changes, the detection of Ph-like ALL cases currently requires multiple cytogenetic and molecular assays; thus, our goal was to develop a consolidated workflow for detecting genetic abnormalities in Ph-like ALL. We found that total and targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based approach allowed the detection of abnormal fusion transcripts (EBF1-PDGFRB, P2RY8-CRLF2, RCSD1-ABL1, and RCSD1-ABL2). The bioinformatics algorithm accurately detected the fusion transcripts without prior input about possible events. Additionally, we showed that RNAseq analysis enabled evaluation for disease-associated sequence variants in expressed transcripts. While total RNAseq can be a second tier approach allowing discovery of novel genetic alterations, the targeted RNAseq workflow offers a clinically applicable method for the detection of fusion transcripts.",Journal Article,1160.0,5.0,Philadelphia Ph -like acute lymphoblastic leukemia molecular subtype high-risk B-cell characterized formation abnormal fusions involving tyrosine kinase TK cytokine receptor activation TK signaling diversity associated genetic changes detection Ph-like cases currently requires multiple cytogenetic molecular goal develop consolidated workflow detecting genetic abnormalities Ph-like total targeted RNA sequencing RNAseq -based approach allowed detection abnormal fusion transcripts EBF1-PDGFRB P2RY8-CRLF2 RCSD1-ABL1 RCSD1-ABL2 bioinformatics algorithm accurately detected fusion transcripts prior input possible events Additionally showed RNAseq enabled evaluation disease-associated sequence expressed transcripts total RNAseq second tier approach allowing discovery novel genetic alterations targeted RNAseq workflow offers clinically applicable detection fusion transcripts,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3006, 2058, 733, 286, 1275, 62, 16, 8, 219, 875, 1, 64, 43, 132, 31, 62, 765, 20, 1264, 1, 1668, 145, 2530, 1267, 564, 216, 5067, 2, 1675, 153, 214, 2, 363, 1, 5067, 314, 408, 1, 3, 3653, 1, 41, 336, 400, 3, 638, 1, 2058, 733, 62, 140, 694, 1706, 232, 1266, 2, 219, 1013, 631, 114, 1326, 10, 6, 690, 8, 18934, 8825, 9, 2502, 336, 1171, 4, 2058, 733, 62, 21, 204, 17, 181, 2, 238, 893, 615, 13213, 90, 353, 2313, 3, 638, 1, 1668, 1212, 2680, 23701, 10231, 25205, 8895, 50097, 3557, 2, 50097, 18452, 3, 6579, 2124, 2141, 530, 3, 1212, 2680, 187, 324, 5772, 545, 899, 281, 1724, 21, 224, 17, 13213, 65, 4387, 451, 9, 34, 41, 1532, 839, 4, 570, 2680, 369, 181, 13213, 122, 40, 8, 419, 8377, 353, 2952, 1574, 1, 229, 336, 593, 3, 238, 13213, 8825, 2339, 8, 505, 3801, 596, 9, 3, 638, 1, 1212, 2680]",1108.0,27855558,Diagnostic evaluation RNA sequencing detection genetic abnormalities associated Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Haploidentical Transplantation with Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide for High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-11-14,"Haploidentical transplantation performed with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis has been associated with favorable outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and lymphomas. However, it remains unclear if such approach is effective for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed outcomes of 109 consecutively treated ALL patients 18 years of age and older at 5 institutions. The median age was 32 years and the median follow-up for survivors was 13 months. Thirty-two patients were in first complete remission (CR1), while the rest were beyond CR1. Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 95% of the patients. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III and IV acute GVHD at day 100 after transplantation were 32% and 11%, respectively, whereas chronic GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, relapse rate, and disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year after transplantation were 32%, 21%, 27%, and 51%, respectively.

"Activating NOTCH1 Mutations Define a Distinct Subgroup of Patients With Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Who Have Poor Prognosis, Propensity to Bone and Liver Metastasis, and Potential Responsiveness to Notch1 Inhibitors.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-11-21,"Purpose Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) represent a heterogeneous group of chemotherapy refractory tumors, with a subset demonstrating an aggressive phenotype. We investigated the molecular underpinnings of this phenotype and assessed the Notch1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Methods We genotyped 102 ACCs that had available pathologic and clinical data. Notch1 activation was assessed by immunohistochemistry for Notch1 intracellular domain. Luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm Notch1 target gene expression in vitro. The Notch1 inhibitor brontictuzumab was tested in patient-derived xenografts from patients with ACC and in a patient with ACC who was enrolled in a phase I study. Results NOTCH1 mutations occurred predominantly (14 of 15 patients) in the negative regulatory region and Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr-rich domains, the same two hotspots seen in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and led to pathway activation in vitro. NOTCH1-mutant tumors demonstrated significantly higher levels of Notch1 pathway activation than wild-type tumors on the basis of Notch1 intracellular domain staining ( P = .004). NOTCH1 mutations define a distinct aggressive ACC subgroup with a significantly higher likelihood of solid subtype ( P < .001), advanced-stage disease at diagnosis ( P = .02), higher rate of liver and bone metastasis ( P ≤ .02), shorter relapse-free survival (median, 13 v 34 months; P = .01), and shorter overall survival (median 30 v 122 months; P = .001) when compared with NOTCH1 wild-type tumors. Significant tumor growth inhibition with brontictuzumab was observed exclusively in the ACC patient-derived xenograft model that harbored a NOTCH1 activating mutation.

High Frequency and Poor Outcome of Philadelphia Chromosome-Like Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Adults.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-11-21,"Purpose Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a high-risk subtype of childhood ALL characterized by kinase-activating alterations that are amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to define the prevalence and genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL in adults and assess response to conventional chemotherapy. Patients and Methods The frequency of Ph-like ALL was assessed by gene expression profiling of 798 patients with B-cell ALL age 21 to 86 years. Event-free survival and overall survival were determined for Ph-like ALL versus non-Ph-like ALL patients. Detailed genomic analysis was performed on 180 of 194 patients with Ph-like ALL. Results Patients with Ph-like ALL accounted for more than 20% of adults with ALL, including 27.9% of young adults (age 21 to 39 years), 20.4% of adults (age 40 to 59 years), and 24.0% of older adults (age 60 to 86 years). Overall, patients with Ph-like ALL had an inferior 5-year event-free survival compared with patients with non-Ph-like ALL (22.5% [95% CI, 14.9% to 29.3%; n = 155] v 49.3% [95% CI, 42.8% to 56.2%; n = 247], respectively; P < .001). We identified kinase-activating alterations in 88% of patients with Ph-like ALL, including CRLF2 rearrangements (51%), ABL class fusions (9.8%), JAK2 or EPOR rearrangements (12.4%), other JAK-STAT sequence mutations (7.2%), other kinase alterations (4.1%), and Ras pathway mutations (3.6%). Eleven new kinase rearrangements were identified, including four involving new kinase or cytokine receptor genes and seven involving new partners for previously identified genes. Conclusion Ph-like ALL is a highly prevalent subtype of ALL in adults and is associated with poor outcome. The diverse range of kinase-activating alterations in Ph-like ALL has important therapeutic implications.

Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2016-11-21,"Current standard of care for patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is mainly effective, with high remission rates after treatment. However, the genetic perturbations that give rise to this disease remain largely undefined, limiting the ability to address resistant tumors or develop less toxic targeted therapies. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to interrogate the genetic and pathogenic mechanisms of 240 pediatric ALL cases with their matched remission samples. Commonly mutated genes fell into several categories, including RAS/receptor tyrosine kinases, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors involved in lineage commitment, and the p53/cell-cycle pathway. Unique recurrent mutational hotspots were observed in epigenetic regulators CREBBP (R1446C/H), WHSC1 (E1099K), and the tyrosine kinase FLT3 (K663R, N676K). The mutant WHSC1 was established as a gain-of-function oncogene, while the epigenetic regulator ARID1A and transcription factor CTCF were functionally identified as potential tumor suppressors. Analysis of 28 diagnosis/relapse trio patients plus 10 relapse cases revealed four evolutionary paths and uncovered the ordering of acquisition of mutations in these patients. This study provides a detailed mutational portrait of pediatric ALL and gives insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disease.

Whole-transcriptome sequencing identifies a distinct subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with predominant genomic abnormalities of EP300 and CREBBP.,Genome research,Genome Res.,2016-11-30,"Chromosomal translocations are a genomic hallmark of many hematologic malignancies. Often as initiating events, these structural abnormalities result in fusion proteins involving transcription factors important for hematopoietic differentiation and/or signaling molecules regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle. In contrast, epigenetic regulator genes are more frequently targeted by somatic sequence mutations, possibly as secondary events to further potentiate leukemogenesis. Through comprehensive whole-transcriptome sequencing of 231 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we identified 58 putative functional and predominant fusion genes in 54.1% of patients (n = 125), 31 of which have not been reported previously. In particular, we described a distinct ALL subtype with a characteristic gene expression signature predominantly driven by chromosomal rearrangements of the ZNF384 gene with histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP ZNF384-rearranged ALL showed significant up-regulation of CLCF1 and BTLA expression, and ZNF384 fusion proteins consistently showed higher activity to promote transcription of these target genes relative to wild-type ZNF384 in vitro. Ectopic expression of EP300-ZNF384 and CREBBP-ZNF384 fusion altered differentiation of mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and also potentiated oncogenic transformation in vitro. EP300- and CREBBP-ZNF384 fusions resulted in loss of histone lysine acetyltransferase activity in a dominant-negative fashion, with concomitant global reduction of histone acetylation and increased sensitivity of leukemia cells to histone deacetylase inhibitors.

Cancer Res.,2016-11-30,"<b>Purpose:</b> The oncogenic miR-155 is upregulated in many human cancers, and its expression is increased in more aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors, but the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-155-induced therapy resistance are not fully understood. The main objectives of this study were to determine the role of miR-155 in resistance to chemotherapy and to evaluate anti-miR-155 treatment to chemosensitize tumors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed <i>in vitro</i> studies on cell lines to investigate the role of miR-155 in therapy resistance. To assess the effects of miR-155 inhibition on chemoresistance, we used an <i>in vivo</i> orthotopic lung cancer model of athymic nude mice, which we treated with anti-miR-155 alone or in combination with chemotherapy. To analyze the association of miR-155 expression and the combination of miR-155 and <i>TP53</i> expression with cancer survival, we studied 956 patients with lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.<b>Results:</b> We demonstrate that miR-155 induces resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents <i>in vitro</i>, and that downregulation of miR-155 successfully resensitizes tumors to chemotherapy <i>in vivo</i> We show that anti-miR-155-DOPC can be considered non-toxic <i>in vivo</i> We further demonstrate that miR-155 and <i>TP53</i> are linked in a negative feedback mechanism and that a combination of high expression of miR-155 and low expression of <i>TP53</i> is significantly associated with shorter survival in lung cancer.<b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings support the existence of an miR-155/TP53 feedback loop, which is involved in resistance to chemotherapy and which can be specifically targeted to overcome drug resistance, an important cause of cancer-related death. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(11); 2891-904. ©2016 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1147.0,49.0,b Purpose /b oncogenic miR-155 upregulated human expression increased aggressive therapy-resistant molecular mechanisms underlying miR-155-induced therapy resistance fully understood main objectives determine role miR-155 resistance chemotherapy evaluate anti-miR-155 treatment chemosensitize tumors. b Experimental Design /b performed vitro /i studies lines investigate role miR-155 therapy resistance assess effects miR-155 inhibition chemoresistance vivo /i orthotopic lung model athymic nude mice treated anti-miR-155 combination chemotherapy association miR-155 expression combination miR-155 TP53 /i expression survival studied 956 patients lung chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia. b /b demonstrate miR-155 induces resistance multiple chemotherapeutic agents vitro /i downregulation miR-155 successfully resensitizes chemotherapy vivo /i anti-miR-155-DOPC considered non-toxic vivo /i demonstrate miR-155 TP53 /i linked negative feedback mechanism combination high expression miR-155 low expression TP53 /i significantly associated shorter survival lung cancer. b Conclusions /b findings support existence miR-155/TP53 feedback loop involved resistance chemotherapy specifically targeted overcome drug resistance important cause cancer-related death Clin Res 23 11 2891-904 ©2016 AACR /i,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 3, 1302, 722, 3735, 16, 2684, 4, 445, 171, 163, 2, 211, 55, 16, 101, 4, 80, 571, 2, 36, 436, 57, 84, 3, 219, 483, 1181, 722, 3735, 277, 36, 251, 32, 44, 1910, 1784, 3, 1895, 2409, 1, 26, 45, 11, 6, 223, 3, 200, 1, 722, 3735, 4, 251, 6, 56, 2, 6, 376, 312, 722, 3735, 24, 6, 39955, 57, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 21, 173, 70, 4, 439, 70, 94, 23, 31, 285, 6, 963, 3, 200, 1, 722, 3735, 4, 36, 251, 6, 423, 3, 176, 1, 722, 3735, 297, 23, 3782, 21, 95, 35, 70, 4, 386, 70, 2157, 12, 202, 1, 6396, 2598, 399, 92, 21, 73, 5, 312, 722, 3735, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 56, 6, 1992, 3, 248, 1, 722, 3735, 55, 2, 3, 150, 1, 722, 3735, 2, 70, 1206, 70, 55, 5, 12, 25, 21, 656, 14137, 7, 5, 12, 442, 1193, 2, 286, 1275, 2647, 132, 99, 132, 21, 608, 17, 722, 3735, 1516, 251, 6, 232, 1573, 183, 70, 4, 439, 70, 2, 17, 2475, 1, 722, 3735, 1878, 32683, 57, 6, 56, 70, 4, 386, 70, 21, 514, 17, 312, 722, 3735, 8476, 122, 40, 515, 220, 1812, 70, 4, 386, 70, 21, 195, 608, 17, 722, 3735, 2, 70, 1206, 70, 32, 1199, 4, 8, 199, 3983, 670, 2, 17, 8, 150, 1, 64, 55, 1, 722, 3735, 2, 154, 55, 1, 70, 1206, 70, 16, 97, 41, 5, 985, 25, 4, 12, 132, 2130, 132, 114, 272, 538, 3, 5335, 1, 35, 722, 3735, 1206, 3983, 4432, 92, 16, 646, 4, 251, 6, 56, 2, 92, 122, 40, 1225, 238, 6, 1768, 234, 251, 35, 305, 708, 1, 12, 139, 273, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 175, 23972, 13145, 3456, 1630, 70]",1783.0,27903673,Combining Anti-Mir-155 Chemotherapy Treatment Lung,0,0.0
Association between dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and attention in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with only chemotherapy.,Psychoneuroendocrinology,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2016-11-16,"Long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive impairment, as well as compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) is an adrenal androgen commonly used as a marker of HPA function. In the general population, a low level of DHEAS has been associated with poorer cognition. At ≥2years post-treatment, we examined the association of DHEAS with attention outcomes in 35 male and 34 female long-term survivors of childhood ALL (mean[standard deviation] age at evaluation 14.5[4.7] years; 7.5[1.9] years post-diagnosis) who were treated with only chemotherapy and without prophylactic cranial irradiation. Male survivors with low-normal levels of DHEAS had worse performance than male survivors with high levels of DHEAS on multiple measures of attention (all P's<0.05). However, association between DHEAS and attention measures were not found in female survivors. Our results suggest that survivors of ALL who suffer from partial but persistent adrenal insufficiency may be at risk for neurocognitive deficits. This finding should be validated in a larger prospective study, with attention to sex differences in the potential impact of adrenal insufficiency on neurocognitive outcomes.",Journal Article,1161.0,4.0,Long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk neurocognitive impairment compromised hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal HPA function Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate DHEAS adrenal androgen commonly marker HPA function general population low level DHEAS associated poorer cognition ≥2years post-treatment examined association DHEAS attention outcomes 35 male 34 female long-term survivors childhood mean standard deviation age evaluation 14.5 4.7 years 7.5 1.9 years post-diagnosis treated chemotherapy prophylactic cranial irradiation Male survivors low-normal levels DHEAS worse performance male survivors high levels DHEAS multiple measures attention P 's 0.05 association DHEAS attention measures female survivors suggest survivors suffer partial persistent adrenal insufficiency risk neurocognitive deficits finding validated larger prospective attention sex differences potential impact adrenal insufficiency neurocognitive outcomes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 28, 43, 9, 2958, 2315, 22, 149, 22, 4867, 7531, 12098, 2987, 14513, 343, 12317, 6424, 16919, 16, 35, 2987, 687, 841, 95, 22, 8, 952, 1, 14513, 343, 4, 3, 1083, 266, 8, 154, 301, 1, 16919, 71, 85, 41, 5, 1769, 8130, 28, 69429, 539, 24, 21, 409, 3, 248, 1, 16919, 5, 2111, 123, 4, 465, 1045, 2, 562, 1061, 319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 62, 313, 260, 3348, 89, 28, 451, 213, 33, 39, 67, 60, 67, 33, 14, 83, 60, 539, 147, 54, 11, 73, 5, 158, 56, 2, 187, 1862, 2565, 1104, 1045, 332, 5, 154, 295, 148, 1, 16919, 42, 639, 528, 76, 1045, 332, 5, 64, 148, 1, 16919, 23, 232, 1018, 1, 2111, 62, 19, 292, 13, 474, 137, 248, 59, 16919, 2, 2111, 1018, 11, 44, 204, 4, 1061, 332, 114, 99, 309, 17, 332, 1, 62, 54, 6506, 29, 450, 84, 1882, 2987, 4360, 68, 40, 28, 43, 9, 2958, 2752, 26, 1567, 257, 40, 938, 4, 8, 1077, 482, 45, 5, 2111, 6, 1035, 362, 4, 3, 174, 345, 1, 2987, 4360, 23, 2958, 123]",1250.0,27907849,Association dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate attention long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated chemotherapy,50,0.0546448087431694
Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a high-risk subtype in adults.,Blood,Blood,2016-12-05,"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a high-risk subtype of ALL in children. There are conflicting data on the incidence and prognosis of Ph-like ALL in adults. Patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL (B-ALL) who received frontline chemotherapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center underwent gene expression profiling of leukemic cells. Of 148 patients, 33.1% had Ph-like, 31.1% had Ph<sup>+</sup>, and 35.8% had other B-ALL subtypes (B-other). Within the Ph-like ALL cohort, 61% had cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) overexpression. Patients with Ph-like ALL had significantly worse overall survival (OS), and event-free survival compared with B-other with a 5-year survival of 23% (vs 59% for B-other, P = .006). Sixty-eight percent of patients with Ph-like ALL were of Hispanic ethnicity. The following were associated with inferior OS on multivariable analysis: age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.299; P < .001), white blood cell count (HR, 1.910; P = .017), platelet count (HR, 7.437; P = .005), and Ph-like ALL (HR, 1.818; P = .03). Next-generation sequencing of the CRLF2<sup>+</sup> group identified mutations in the JAK-STAT and Ras pathway in 85% of patients, and 20% had a CRLF2 mutation. Within the CRLF2<sup>+</sup> group, JAK2 mutation was associated with inferior outcomes.

CD19-Targeted CAR T cells as novel cancer immunotherapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2016-10-01,"Immunotherapy has demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-resistant hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. One type of immunotherapy involves the adoptive transfer of T cells that have been genetically modified with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to target a tumor. These hybrid proteins are composed of the antigen-binding domains of an antibody fused to T-cell receptor signaling machinery. CAR T cells that target CD19 recently have made the jump from the laboratory to the clinic, and the results have been remarkable. CD19-targeted CAR T cells have induced complete remissions of disease in up to 90% of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), who have an expected complete response rate of 30% in response to chemotherapy.

A thymidylate synthase polymorphism is associated with increased risk for bone toxicity among children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-12-13,"Bone fractures and osteonecrosis frequently complicate therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone toxicity has been associated with exposure to corticosteroids and methotrexate (MTX) and age greater than 10 years. We tested whether common genetic polymorphisms were associated with bone toxicity during treatment for ALL. A total of 615 of 794 children enrolled on Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this analysis. Nineteen candidate polymorphisms were selected a priori, targeting genes related to glucocorticoid metabolism, oxidative damage, and folate physiology. Polymorphisms were genotyped using either PCR-based allelic discrimination or PCR product length analysis. Twenty percent of subjects were homozygous for two 28 bp repeats (2R/2R, where 2R is two 28-nucleotide repeats within the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of the thymidylate synthase [TS] gene) within the 5' UTR of the gene for TS. This 2R/2R genotype was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.95; P = 0.013), and with bone fracture among children ≥ 10 years (multivariable HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11-3.96; P = 0.022). No significant association was observed between TS genotype and red blood cell (RBC) folate, RBC MTX, or relapse risk. A common genetic variant is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis and with bone fractures among older children. These findings suggest that children and adolescents with the 2R/2R TS genotype should be closely monitored for the development of bone toxicity during therapy for ALL, and support a clinical trial testing the efficacy of protective interventions specifically in this vulnerable population.",Journal Article,1134.0,6.0,Bone fractures osteonecrosis frequently complicate therapy childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Bone toxicity associated exposure corticosteroids methotrexate MTX age greater 10 years tested common genetic polymorphisms associated bone toxicity treatment total 615 794 children enrolled Dana Farber Institute Consortium protocol 05-001 NCT00400946 met eligibility criteria inclusion Nineteen candidate polymorphisms selected priori targeting related glucocorticoid metabolism oxidative damage folate physiology Polymorphisms genotyped PCR-based allelic discrimination PCR product length percent subjects homozygous 28 bp repeats 2R/2R 2R 28-nucleotide repeats 5 untranslated region UTR thymidylate synthase TS 5 UTR TS 2R/2R genotype associated increased risk osteonecrosis children younger 10 years diagnosis multivariable hazard ratio HR 2.71 95 confidence interval CI 1.23-5.95 P 0.013 bone fracture children ≥ 10 years multivariable HR 2.10 95 CI 1.11-3.96 P 0.022 significant association observed TS genotype red blood RBC folate RBC MTX relapse risk common genetic associated increased risk osteonecrosis children younger 10 years diagnosis bone fractures older children findings suggest children adolescents 2R/2R TS genotype closely monitored development bone toxicity therapy support clinical trial testing efficacy protective interventions specifically vulnerable population,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3909, 2, 5404, 746, 11157, 36, 9, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 155, 71, 85, 41, 5, 645, 6, 3876, 2, 2116, 3453, 2, 89, 378, 76, 79, 60, 21, 650, 317, 186, 336, 1203, 11, 41, 5, 155, 190, 24, 9, 62, 8, 181, 1, 11970, 1, 13085, 541, 346, 23, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 62, 2404, 1182, 474, 144, 34806, 543, 2317, 371, 9, 1680, 4, 26, 65, 3498, 1609, 1203, 11, 715, 8, 7499, 529, 214, 139, 6, 5399, 1600, 3495, 1350, 2, 3100, 7206, 1203, 11, 3053, 75, 361, 604, 90, 3861, 3520, 15, 604, 2821, 1318, 65, 737, 714, 1, 976, 11, 3189, 9, 100, 339, 3044, 7197, 8145, 8145, 1257, 8145, 16, 100, 339, 1579, 7197, 262, 3, 33, 7379, 1053, 8196, 1, 3, 6205, 3522, 3527, 145, 262, 3, 33, 8196, 1, 3, 145, 9, 3527, 26, 8145, 8145, 1183, 10, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 5404, 107, 541, 773, 76, 79, 60, 28, 147, 658, 360, 197, 168, 18, 792, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 382, 33, 48, 19, 13, 3612, 2, 5, 3956, 107, 541, 749, 79, 60, 658, 168, 18, 79, 48, 58, 14, 175, 27, 921, 19, 13, 4773, 77, 93, 248, 10, 164, 59, 3527, 1183, 2, 3422, 315, 31, 7256, 3100, 7256, 3453, 15, 429, 43, 8, 186, 336, 1142, 16, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 5404, 107, 541, 773, 76, 79, 60, 28, 147, 2, 5, 3909, 107, 434, 541, 46, 272, 309, 17, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 3, 8145, 8145, 3527, 1183, 257, 40, 3210, 2909, 9, 3, 193, 1, 155, 190, 36, 9, 62, 2, 538, 8, 38, 160, 471, 3, 209, 1, 2864, 1151, 1225, 4, 26, 5017, 266]",1808.0,27957785,thymidylate synthase polymorphism associated increased risk bone toxicity children treated acute lymphoblastic leukemia,79,0.08633879781420765
Phase I/Phase II Study of Blinatumomab in Pediatric Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-31,"Purpose Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19 on B-cell lymphoblasts. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, and potential for efficacy of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Methods This open-label study enrolled children < 18 years old with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL in a phase I dosage-escalation part and a phase II part, using 6-week treatment cycles. Primary end points were maximum-tolerated dosage (phase I) and complete remission rate within the first two cycles (phase II). Results We treated 49 patients in phase I and 44 patients in phase II. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 (phase I). Three experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome (one attributed to grade 5 cardiac failure); one had fatal respiratory failure. The maximum-tolerated dosage was 15 µg/m<sup>2</sup>/d. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was linear across dosage levels and consistent among age groups. On the basis of the phase I data, the recommended blinatumomab dosage for children with relapsed/refractory ALL was 5 µg/m<sup>2</sup>/d for the first 7 days, followed by 15 µg/m<sup>2</sup>/d thereafter. Among the 70 patients who received the recommended dosage, 27 (39%; 95% CI, 27% to 51%) achieved complete remission within the first two cycles, 14 (52%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 adverse events were anemia (36%), thrombocytopenia (21%), and hypokalemia (17%). Three patients (4%) and one patient (1%) had cytokine-release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3%) interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures. Conclusion This trial, which to the best of our knowledge was the first such trial in pediatrics, demonstrated antileukemic activity of single-agent blinatumomab with complete minimal residual disease response in children with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL. Blinatumomab may represent an important new treatment option in this setting, requiring further investigation in curative indications.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1177.0,153.0,Purpose Blinatumomab bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19 B-cell lymphoblasts evaluated safety pharmacokinetics recommended dosage potential efficacy blinatumomab children relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia BCP-ALL Methods open-label enrolled children 18 years old relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL phase dosage-escalation phase II 6-week treatment cycles Primary end points maximum-tolerated dosage phase complete remission rate cycles phase II treated 49 patients phase 44 patients phase II patients dose-limiting toxicities cycle 1 phase experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome attributed grade 5 cardiac failure fatal respiratory failure maximum-tolerated dosage 15 µg/m sup 2 /sup /d Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics linear dosage levels consistent age groups basis phase recommended blinatumomab dosage children relapsed/refractory 5 µg/m sup 2 /sup /d 7 days followed 15 µg/m sup 2 /sup /d 70 patients received recommended dosage 27 39 95 CI 27 51 achieved complete remission cycles 14 52 achieved complete minimal residual disease response frequent grade ≥ 3 adverse events anemia 36 thrombocytopenia 21 hypokalemia 17 patients 4 patient 1 cytokine-release syndrome grade 3 4 respectively patients 3 interrupted treatment grade 2 seizures trial best knowledge trial pediatrics demonstrated antileukemic activity single-agent blinatumomab complete minimal residual disease response children relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL Blinatumomab represent important new treatment option setting requiring investigation curative indications,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[743, 7182, 16, 8, 7408, 102, 31, 19374, 548, 3883, 529, 3158, 23, 132, 31, 10521, 21, 194, 3, 367, 1159, 793, 3323, 2, 174, 9, 209, 1, 7182, 4, 541, 5, 591, 430, 132, 31, 2765, 286, 1275, 13168, 62, 636, 26, 1020, 1756, 45, 346, 541, 203, 60, 1095, 5, 591, 430, 13168, 62, 4, 8, 124, 70, 3323, 1125, 760, 2, 8, 124, 215, 760, 75, 49, 647, 24, 410, 86, 396, 862, 11, 689, 421, 3323, 124, 70, 2, 236, 734, 116, 262, 3, 157, 100, 410, 124, 215, 99, 21, 73, 739, 7, 4, 124, 70, 2, 584, 7, 4, 124, 215, 294, 7, 42, 61, 817, 385, 4, 417, 14, 124, 70, 169, 592, 88, 39, 1675, 2008, 681, 104, 3073, 6, 88, 33, 496, 104, 42, 3034, 2718, 496, 3, 689, 421, 3323, 10, 167, 7570, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 7182, 1159, 10, 1646, 716, 3323, 148, 2, 925, 107, 89, 271, 23, 3, 877, 1, 3, 124, 70, 74, 3, 793, 7182, 3323, 9, 541, 5, 591, 430, 62, 10, 33, 7570, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 9, 3, 157, 67, 162, 370, 20, 167, 7570, 188, 172, 18, 172, 427, 3972, 107, 3, 431, 7, 54, 103, 3, 793, 3323, 428, 587, 48, 58, 428, 6, 725, 513, 236, 734, 262, 3, 157, 100, 410, 213, 653, 1, 953, 513, 236, 1048, 753, 34, 51, 3, 96, 908, 88, 749, 27, 290, 281, 11, 1545, 511, 1340, 239, 2, 7799, 269, 169, 7, 39, 2, 104, 69, 14, 42, 1675, 2008, 681, 1, 88, 27, 2, 39, 106, 100, 7, 27, 12981, 24, 50, 88, 18, 4448, 1221, 26, 160, 92, 6, 3, 824, 1, 114, 922, 10, 3, 157, 225, 160, 4, 12616, 264, 4512, 128, 1, 226, 420, 7182, 5, 236, 1048, 753, 34, 51, 4, 541, 5, 591, 430, 13168, 62, 7182, 68, 1231, 35, 305, 217, 24, 1501, 4, 26, 546, 1888, 195, 940, 4, 1075, 2406]",2037.0,27998223,Phase I/Phase II Blinatumomab Pediatric Patients Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,0,0.0
Poor outcomes associated with +der(22)t(9;22) and -9/9p in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-02-03,"In patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), the prognostic impact of additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) is not well-established. We evaluated the prognostic impact of individual ACAs in 152 patients with Ph+ ALL receiving first-line intensive chemotherapy plus either imatinib (n = 36), dasatinib (n = 74), or ponatinib (n = 42). ACAs were identified in 118 patients (78%). Compared to outcomes of patients without ACAs, ACAs were not associated with differences in either relapse-free survival (RFS; P = 0.42) or overall survival (OS; P = 0.51). When individual ACAs were evaluated, +der(22)t(9;22) and/or -9/9p in the absence of high hyperdiploidy (HeH) was present in 16% of patients and constituted a poor-risk ACA group. Patients with one or more poor-risk ACAs in the absence of HeH had significantly shorter RFS (5-year RFS rate 33% versus 59%, P = 0.01) and OS (5-year OS rate 24% versus 63%, P = 0.003).

Next-Generation Sequencing in Adult B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-01-03,"We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the immunoglobulin genes to evaluate residual disease in 153 specimens from 32 patients with adult B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in a single multicenter study. The sequencing results were compared with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) data in 66 specimens (25 patients) analyzed by both methods. There was a strong concordance (82%) between the methods in the qualitative determination of the presence of disease. However, in 17% of cases, leukemia was detected by sequencing but not by MFC. In 54 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) paired specimens, the burden of leukemia detected by NGS was lower in PB than in BM, although it was still detectable in 68% of the 28 paired specimens with positive BM. Lastly, patients without disease detected by NGS or MFC had a 5-year relapse free survival of > 80%. The results suggest that residual disease detection by immunoglobulin gene sequencing is an extremely sensitive technique and may identify patients that might benefit from transplantation. Moreover, the increased sensitivity of the method may allow frequent peripheral blood testing to supplement marrow sampling to measure disease response.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1113.0,17.0,next-generation sequencing NGS immunoglobulin evaluate residual disease 153 specimens 32 patients adult B acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled single multicenter sequencing compared multiparameter flow cytometry MFC 66 specimens 25 patients methods strong concordance 82 methods qualitative determination presence disease 17 cases leukemia detected sequencing MFC 54 bone marrow BM peripheral blood PB paired specimens burden leukemia detected NGS lower PB BM detectable 68 28 paired specimens positive BM Lastly patients disease detected NGS MFC 5-year relapse free survival 80 suggest residual disease detection immunoglobulin sequencing extremely sensitive technique identify patients benefit transplantation increased sensitivity allow frequent peripheral blood testing supplement marrow sampling measure disease response,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 95, 1305, 914, 615, 2650, 1, 3, 2593, 214, 6, 376, 753, 34, 4, 4251, 623, 29, 531, 7, 5, 780, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 346, 4, 8, 226, 1570, 45, 3, 615, 99, 11, 72, 5, 10757, 1412, 1914, 9439, 74, 4, 700, 623, 243, 7, 311, 20, 110, 636, 125, 10, 8, 1082, 1827, 878, 59, 3, 636, 4, 3, 3926, 3104, 1, 3, 463, 1, 34, 137, 4, 269, 1, 140, 10, 530, 20, 615, 84, 44, 20, 9439, 4, 667, 581, 1246, 2, 672, 315, 3767, 2355, 623, 3, 892, 1, 530, 20, 2650, 10, 280, 4, 3767, 76, 4, 1246, 242, 192, 10, 1234, 2083, 4, 806, 1, 3, 339, 2355, 623, 5, 109, 1246, 6354, 7, 187, 34, 530, 20, 2650, 15, 9439, 42, 8, 33, 111, 429, 115, 25, 1, 493, 3, 99, 309, 17, 753, 34, 638, 20, 2593, 145, 615, 16, 35, 2938, 745, 1312, 2, 68, 255, 7, 17, 822, 247, 29, 497, 1393, 3, 101, 485, 1, 3, 596, 68, 1700, 908, 672, 315, 471, 6, 5836, 581, 2874, 6, 1463, 34, 51]",1151.0,28062215,Next-Generation Sequencing Adult B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients,40,0.04371584699453552
Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia: current challenges in diagnosis and therapy.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2017-03-01,"Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare disease that poses many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Patients with MPAL are considered to have poor outcomes. The difficulties in classifying this leukemia, the lack of prospectively collected data concerning therapeutic outcomes, and rare incidence result in much uncertainty as to the best approach for patients with MPAL. Recent studies demonstrated that most MPALs are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities; genetic sequencing studies disclose a high frequency of somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, and transcription factors. The limited available data suggest that higher remission rates are achieved with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like induction regimens compared with acute myeloid leukemia-type approaches. Allogeneic transplantation in first remission may be associated with improved survival compared with consolidation chemotherapy. Advances in understanding the genetic landscape of MPAL may allow a more biologically driven classification of this heterogeneous group of leukemias in the future that will lead to optimized therapies for individual patients.

Neurocognitive outcomes among children who experienced seizures during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-01-28,"Limited information is available regarding neurocognitive outcomes of children who experience seizures during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Accordingly, the main objectives of this study were to determine the incidence and risk factors for treatment-related seizures among children with ALL, and the neurocognitive outcomes associated with treatment-related seizures. Prospective neuropsychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were planned for all 498 patients with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled on the St. Jude Total Therapy XV (TOTXV) protocol at three time points. The study database was reviewed retrospectively to identify those with treatment-related seizure. To assess neurocognitive changes associated with seizure, each patient with treatment-related seizure was matched with two cohort patients without seizure for age at treatment, gender, race, and treatment intensity. Nineteen patients developed seizure, with a 2-year cumulative risk of 3.82 ± 0.86% (SE). No risk factors were identified to be associated with the development of seizure, with a possible exception of intensive chemotherapy used on the standard/high-risk arm as compared to the low-risk arm. Neuropsychological performance of the seizure group, as compared to normative scores and nonseizure control cohort, indicated problems in attention, working memory, and processing speed. Cognitive deficits persisted 2 years after therapy, with additional declines in intellectual function observed.

Synergistic Drug Combinations with a CDK4/6 Inhibitor in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-11-09,"<b>Purpose:</b> Although significant progress has been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), many patients will require additional therapy for relapsed/refractory disease. Cyclin D3 (CCND3) and CDK6 are highly expressed in T-ALL and have been effectively targeted in mutant NOTCH1-driven mouse models of this disease with a CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitor. Combination therapy, however, will be needed for the successful treatment of human disease.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed preclinical drug testing using a panel of T-ALL cell lines first with LEE011, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and next with the combination of LEE011 with a panel of drugs relevant to T-ALL treatment. We then tested the combination of LEE011 with dexamethasone or everolimus in three orthotopic mouse models and measured on-target drug activity.<b>Results:</b> We first determined that both <i>NOTCH1</i>-mutant and wild-type T-ALL are highly sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/6 when wild-type RB is expressed. Next, we determined that CDK4/6 inhibitors are antagonistic when used either concurrently or in sequence with many of the drugs used to treat relapsed T-ALL (methotrexate, mercaptopurine, asparaginase, and doxorubicin) but are synergistic with glucocorticoids, an mTOR inhibitor, and gamma secretase inhibitor. The combinations of LEE011 with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the mTOR inhibitor everolimus were tested <i>in vivo</i> and prolonged survival in three orthotopic mouse models of T-ALL. On-target activity was measured in peripheral blood and tissue of treated mice.<b>Conclusions:</b> We conclude that LEE011 is active in T-ALL and that combination therapy with corticosteroids and/or mTOR inhibitors warrants further investigation. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 1012-24. ©2016 AACR</i><i>See related commentary by Carroll et al., p. 873</i>.",Journal Article,1168.0,28.0,b Purpose /b significant progress treatment T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL patients require additional therapy relapsed/refractory disease Cyclin D3 CCND3 CDK6 highly expressed T-ALL effectively targeted NOTCH1-driven mouse models disease CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitor Combination therapy needed successful treatment human disease. b Experimental Design /b performed preclinical drug testing panel T-ALL lines LEE011 CDK4/6 inhibitor combination LEE011 panel drugs relevant T-ALL treatment tested combination LEE011 dexamethasone everolimus orthotopic mouse models measured on-target drug activity. b /b determined NOTCH1 /i -mutant wild-type T-ALL highly sensitive pharmacologic inhibition CDK4/6 wild-type RB expressed determined CDK4/6 inhibitors antagonistic concurrently sequence drugs treat relapsed T-ALL methotrexate mercaptopurine asparaginase doxorubicin synergistic glucocorticoids mTOR inhibitor gamma secretase inhibitor combinations LEE011 glucocorticoid dexamethasone mTOR inhibitor everolimus tested vivo /i prolonged survival orthotopic mouse models T-ALL On-target activity measured peripheral blood tissue treated mice. b Conclusions /b conclude LEE011 active T-ALL combination therapy corticosteroids and/or mTOR inhibitors warrants investigation Clin Res 23 4 1012-24 ©2016 AACR /i related commentary Carroll p. 873 /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 242, 93, 1466, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 3, 24, 1, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 445, 7, 303, 1353, 402, 36, 9, 591, 430, 34, 1226, 6037, 25000, 2, 9518, 32, 561, 570, 4, 102, 62, 2, 47, 85, 1856, 238, 4, 620, 4607, 1621, 830, 274, 1, 26, 34, 5, 8, 3254, 49, 302, 1354, 230, 150, 36, 137, 303, 40, 575, 9, 3, 1401, 24, 1, 171, 34, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 21, 173, 693, 234, 471, 75, 8, 993, 1, 102, 62, 31, 285, 157, 5, 18081, 8, 3254, 49, 230, 2, 1305, 5, 3, 150, 1, 18081, 5, 8, 993, 1, 600, 867, 6, 102, 62, 24, 21, 818, 650, 3, 150, 1, 18081, 5, 1217, 15, 1400, 4, 169, 2157, 830, 274, 2, 644, 23, 283, 234, 128, 132, 99, 132, 21, 157, 509, 17, 110, 70, 4607, 70, 620, 2, 955, 267, 102, 62, 32, 561, 745, 6, 2788, 297, 1, 3254, 49, 198, 955, 267, 2955, 16, 570, 1305, 21, 509, 17, 3254, 49, 222, 32, 9863, 198, 95, 361, 3294, 15, 4, 1532, 5, 445, 1, 3, 600, 95, 6, 943, 591, 102, 62, 2116, 9223, 3709, 2, 856, 84, 32, 1806, 5, 7307, 35, 873, 230, 2, 1705, 10014, 230, 3, 1247, 1, 18081, 5, 3, 5399, 1217, 15, 3, 873, 230, 1400, 11, 650, 70, 4, 386, 70, 2, 1069, 25, 4, 169, 2157, 830, 274, 1, 102, 62, 23, 283, 128, 10, 644, 4, 672, 315, 2, 246, 1, 73, 399, 132, 2130, 132, 21, 2060, 17, 18081, 16, 544, 4, 102, 62, 2, 17, 150, 36, 5, 3876, 2, 15, 873, 222, 2782, 195, 940, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 39, 23213, 259, 3456, 1630, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 4662, 20, 37584, 2022, 2171, 19, 13388, 70]",1833.0,28151717,Synergistic Drug Combinations CDK4/6 Inhibitor T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,70,0.07650273224043716

U.S.A.,2017-02-07,"The <i>Notch1</i> gene is a major oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). However, inhibition of NOTCH signaling with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) has shown limited antileukemic activity in clinical trials. Here we performed an expression-based virtual screening to identify highly active antileukemic drugs that synergize with NOTCH1 inhibition in T-ALL. Among these, withaferin A demonstrated the strongest cytotoxic and GSI-synergistic antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, network perturbation analyses showed eIF2A-phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of protein translation as a critical mediator of the antileukemic effects of withaferin A and its interaction with NOTCH1 inhibition. Overall, these results support a role for anti-NOTCH1 therapies and protein translation inhibitor combinations in the treatment of T-ALL.",Journal Article,1078.0,12.0,Notch1 /i major oncogenic driver therapeutic target T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL inhibition NOTCH signaling γ-secretase inhibitors GSIs shown limited antileukemic activity clinical trials performed expression-based virtual screening identify highly active antileukemic drugs synergize NOTCH1 inhibition T-ALL withaferin demonstrated strongest cytotoxic GSI-synergistic antileukemic effects vitro vivo Mechanistically network perturbation showed eIF2A-phosphorylation-mediated inhibition translation critical mediator antileukemic effects withaferin interaction NOTCH1 inhibition Overall support role anti-NOTCH1 therapies translation inhibitor combinations treatment T-ALL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 70, 4607, 70, 145, 16, 8, 458, 1302, 2228, 2, 189, 283, 4, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 137, 297, 1, 3193, 314, 5, 2655, 10014, 222, 45400, 71, 443, 383, 4512, 128, 4, 38, 143, 467, 21, 173, 35, 55, 90, 8455, 453, 6, 255, 561, 544, 4512, 600, 17, 8717, 5, 4607, 297, 4, 102, 62, 107, 46, 21604, 8, 264, 3, 3311, 759, 2, 16937, 1806, 4512, 176, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 4187, 1801, 10564, 318, 224, 41443, 982, 517, 297, 1, 178, 2691, 22, 8, 740, 3810, 1, 3, 4512, 176, 1, 21604, 8, 2, 211, 915, 5, 4607, 297, 63, 46, 99, 538, 8, 200, 9, 312, 4607, 235, 2, 178, 2691, 230, 1247, 4, 3, 24, 1, 102, 62]",873.0,28174276,Synergistic antileukemic therapies NOTCH1 /i -induced T-ALL,0,0.0
Adolescents and Young Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Impact of Care at Specialized Cancer Centers on Survival Outcome.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2017-02-16,"<b>Background:</b> Adolescents and young adults (AYA; 15-39 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) experience inferior survival when compared with children. Impact of care at NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) or Children's Oncology Group sites (COG) on survival disparities remains unstudied.<b>Methods:</b> Using the Los Angeles cancer registry, we identified 1,870 ALL or AML patients between 1 and 39 years at diagnosis. Cox regression analyses assessed risk of mortality; younger age + CCC/COG served as the referent group. Logistic regression was used to determine odds of care at CCC/COG, adjusting for variables above.<b>Results:</b> ALL outcome: AYAs at non-CCC/COG experienced inferior survival (15-21 years: HR = 1.9, <i>P</i> = 0.005; 22-29 years: HR = 2.6, <i>P</i> < 0.001; 30-39 years: HR = 3.0, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Outcome at CCC/COG was comparable between children and young AYAs (15-21 years: HR = 1.3, <i>P</i> = 0.3; 22-29 years: HR = 1.2, <i>P</i> = 0.2) but was inferior for 30- to 39-year-olds (HR = 3.4, <i>P</i> < 0.001). AML outcome: AYAs at non-CCC/COG experienced inferior outcome (15-21 years: HR = 1.8, <i>P</i> = 0.02; 22-39 years: HR = 1.4, <i>P</i> = 0.06). Outcome at CCC/COG was comparable between children and 15- to 21-year-olds (HR = 1.3, <i>P</i> = 0.4) but was inferior for 22- to 39-year-olds (HR = 1.7, <i>P</i> = 0.05). Access: 15- to 21-year-olds were less likely to use CCC/COG than children (<i>P</i> < 0.001). In 22- to 39-year-olds, public/uninsured (ALL: <i>P</i> = 0.004; AML<0.001), African American/Hispanics (ALL: <i>P</i> = 0.03), and 30- to 39-year-olds (ALL: <i>P</i> = 0.03) were less likely to use CCC/COG.<b>Conclusions:</b> Poor survival in AYAs with ALL and AML is mitigated by care at CCC/COG. Barriers to CCC/COG care include public/uninsured, and African American/Hispanic race/ethnicity.<b>Impact:</b> Care at CCC/COG explains, in part, inferior outcomes in AYAs with ALL and AML.

"Temporal Trends in Treatment and Subsequent Neoplasm Risk Among 5-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer, 1970-2015.",JAMA,JAMA,2017-02-01,"Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in subsequent neoplasm risk. To quantify the association between temporal changes in treatment dosing and subsequent neoplasm risk. Retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 5-year cancer survivors diagnosed before age 21 years from pediatric tertiary hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970-1999, with follow-up through December 2015. Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time. Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios for subsequent malignancies, compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Among 23 603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374 638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P < .001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P = .03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P < .001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s.

Improved survival after acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease diagnosis in the modern era.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2017-03-16,"A cute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease remains a major threat to a successful outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. While improvements in treatment and supportive care have occurred, it is unknown whether these advances have resulted in improved outcome specifically among those diagnosed with acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease. We examined outcome following diagnosis of grade II-IV acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease according to time period, and explored effects according to original graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease prophylaxis regimen and maximum overall grade of acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease. Between 1999 and 2012, 2,905 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (56%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (30%) or myelodysplastic syndromes (14%) received a sibling (24%) or unrelated donor (76%) blood (66%) or marrow (34%) transplant and developed grade II-IV acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease (n=497 for 1999-2001, n=962 for 2002-2005, n=1,446 for 2006-2010). The median (range) follow-up was 144 (4-174), 97 (4-147) and 60 (8-99) months for 1999-2001, 2002-2005, and 2006-2010, respectively. Among the cohort with grade II-IV acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease, there was a decrease in the proportion of grade III-IV disease over time with 56%, 47%, and 37% for 1999-2001, 2002-2005, and 2006-2012, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). Considering the total study population, univariate analysis demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival and treatment-related mortality over time, and deaths from organ failure and infection declined. On multivariate analysis, significant improvements in overall survival (<i>P</i>=0.003) and treatment-related mortality (<i>P</i>=0.008) were only noted among those originally treated with tacrolimus-based graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease prophylaxis, and these effects were most apparent among those with overall grade II acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease.

Pharmacogenetic Predictors of Treatment-Related Toxicity Among Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2017-06-01,"The aim of this review is to summarize the most recent and most robust pharmacogenetic predictors of treatment-related toxicity (TRT) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Multiple studies have examined the toxicities of the primary chemotherapeutic agents used to treat childhood ALL in relation to host genetic factors. However, few results have been replicated independently, largely due to cohort differences in ancestry, chemotherapy treatment protocols, and definitions of toxicities. To date, there is only one widely accepted clinical guideline for dose modification based on gene status: thiopurine dosing based on TPMT genotype. Based on recent data, it is likely that this guideline will be modified to incorporate other gene variants, such as NUDT15. We highlight genetic variants that have been consistently associated with TRT across treatment groups, as well as those that best illustrate the underlying pathophysiology of TRT. In the coming decade, we expect that survivorship care will routinely specify screening recommendations based on genetics. Furthermore, clinical trials testing protective interventions may modify inclusion criteria based on genetically determined risk of specific TRTs.",Journal Article,964.0,7.0,aim review summarize recent robust pharmacogenetic predictors treatment-related toxicity TRT childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Multiple studies examined toxicities primary chemotherapeutic agents treat childhood relation host genetic factors replicated independently largely cohort differences ancestry chemotherapy treatment protocols definitions toxicities date widely accepted clinical guideline dose modification based status thiopurine dosing based TPMT genotype Based recent likely guideline modified incorporate NUDT15 highlight genetic consistently associated TRT treatment groups best illustrate underlying pathophysiology TRT coming decade expect survivorship care routinely specify screening recommendations based genetics Furthermore clinical trials testing protective interventions modify inclusion criteria based genetically determined risk specific TRTs,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 206, 16, 6, 2479, 3, 96, 435, 2, 96, 1922, 6578, 674, 1, 24, 139, 155, 7778, 4, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 232, 94, 47, 409, 3, 385, 1, 3, 86, 1573, 183, 95, 6, 943, 864, 62, 4, 2191, 6, 1204, 336, 130, 137, 1021, 99, 47, 85, 6714, 1042, 1733, 520, 6, 180, 362, 4, 3535, 56, 24, 2189, 2, 3833, 1, 385, 6, 1244, 125, 16, 158, 104, 1792, 3058, 38, 2009, 9, 61, 2437, 90, 23, 145, 156, 14062, 1280, 90, 23, 14852, 1183, 90, 23, 435, 74, 192, 16, 322, 17, 26, 2009, 303, 40, 1230, 6, 3360, 127, 145, 839, 225, 22, 18089, 21, 1817, 336, 839, 17, 47, 85, 2433, 41, 5, 7778, 716, 24, 271, 22, 149, 22, 135, 17, 824, 4746, 3, 1181, 4320, 1, 7778, 4, 3, 10671, 2025, 21, 8439, 17, 2560, 165, 303, 3066, 16038, 453, 883, 90, 23, 2894, 798, 38, 143, 471, 2864, 1151, 68, 4289, 1680, 371, 90, 23, 2301, 509, 43, 1, 112, 70069]",1191.0,28317081,Pharmacogenetic Predictors Treatment-Related Toxicity Children Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,27,0.029508196721311476
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-03-22,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population is a difficult clinical problem. The AYA population, generally regarded as patients aged 15 to 39 years, currently draws a good deal of attention, particularly in the area of therapy selection. The current trend is to treat this group of patients with leukemia regimens based on pediatric protocols, and results comparing pediatric approaches versus adult approaches to treatment are maturing. Results are pending from a large US trial in which pediatric-based treatment is given to AYA patients with ALL. In tandem with these new clinical trials, researchers have reported disease features in the AYA group that may explain some of the differences in response to treatment observed in the AYA population compared with the pediatric population. In addition, unique social factors in this age group add to the complexity of ALL therapy in the AYA population. AYA patients are developing independence and separating from their parents. They tend to be noncompliant. Young adults suffer from a lack of health care insurance and poor access to clinical trials, and have specific concerns regarding toxicities, in particular fertility.

In this retrospective analysis, short-acting L-asparaginase (L-ASP) and long-acting polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase (PEG-ASP) were compared for grade 3-4 toxicities and characterized by patient and drug-related factors to identify strategies for toxicity avoidance in adults with ALL. Asparaginase was administered during sequential courses of chemotherapy using a pediatric-inspired treatment regimen. Forty-eight patients who received PEG-ASP and nine patients who received L-ASP were identified. The rates of toxicity were as follows for the PEG-ASP and L-ASP groups, respectively: hepatotoxicity (60% vs. 33%, P = 0.275), pancreatitis (17% vs. 22%, P = 0.650), thrombosis (19.0% vs. 0%, P = 0.328), or any grade 3-4 toxicity (71% vs. 44%, P = 0.143). Toxicity did not correlate with dose, either by individual dose based on flat or BSA-based measures. Logistic regression identified obesity as a risk factor for heptatotoxicity (OR = 8.44, 95% CI: 1.395-51.117). Hypofibrinogenemia was identified as a pharmacodynamic marker for predicting hepatotoxicity.

Novel therapeutic strategies to target leukemic cells that hijack compartmentalized continuous hematopoietic stem cell niches.,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Reviews on cancer,Biochim Biophys Acta Rev Cancer,2017-03-28,"Acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells hijack hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches in the bone marrow and become leukemic stem cells (LSCs) at the expense of normal HSCs. LSCs are quiescent and resistant to chemotherapy and can cause relapse of the disease. HSCs in niches are needed to generate blood cell precursors that are committed to unilineage differentiation and eventually production of mature blood cells, including red blood cells, megakaryocytes, myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Thus far, three types of HSC niches are recognized: endosteal, reticular and perivascular niches. However, we argue here that there is only one type of HSC niche, which consists of a periarteriolar compartment and a perisinusoidal compartment. In the periarteriolar compartment, hypoxia and low levels of reactive oxygen species preserve the HSC pool. In the perisinusoidal compartment, hypoxia in combination with higher levels of reactive oxygen species enables proliferation of progenitor cells and their mobilization into the circulation. Because HSC niches offer protection to LSCs against chemotherapy, we review novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit homing of LSCs in niches for the prevention of dedifferentiation of leukemic cells into LSCs and to stimulate migration of leukemic cells out of niches. These strategies enhance differentiation and proliferation and thus sensitize leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Finally, we list clinical trials of therapies that tackle LSCs in HSC niches to circumvent their protection against chemotherapy.",Journal Article,1029.0,16.0,Acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia hijack hematopoietic stem HSC niches bone marrow leukemic stem LSCs expense normal HSCs LSCs quiescent resistant chemotherapy cause relapse disease HSCs niches needed generate blood precursors committed unilineage differentiation eventually production mature blood including red blood megakaryocytes myeloid lymphocytes far types HSC niches recognized endosteal reticular perivascular niches argue type HSC niche consists periarteriolar compartment perisinusoidal compartment periarteriolar compartment hypoxia low levels reactive oxygen species preserve HSC pool perisinusoidal compartment hypoxia combination higher levels reactive oxygen species enables proliferation progenitor mobilization circulation HSC niches offer protection LSCs chemotherapy review novel therapeutic strategies inhibit homing LSCs niches prevention dedifferentiation leukemic LSCs stimulate migration leukemic niches strategies enhance differentiation proliferation sensitize leukemic chemotherapy Finally list clinical trials therapies tackle LSCs HSC niches circumvent protection chemotherapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[286, 533, 2, 286, 1275, 37, 34675, 1007, 452, 31, 5596, 8005, 4, 3, 581, 2, 1417, 2015, 452, 37, 7033, 28, 3, 8563, 1, 295, 6185, 7033, 32, 6735, 2, 436, 6, 56, 2, 122, 708, 429, 1, 3, 34, 6185, 4, 8005, 32, 575, 6, 2562, 315, 31, 4881, 17, 32, 9552, 6, 33238, 910, 2, 3124, 1529, 1, 2908, 315, 37, 141, 3422, 315, 37, 15110, 533, 37, 2, 1594, 631, 3272, 169, 630, 1, 5596, 8005, 32, 1904, 28333, 24829, 2, 9551, 8005, 137, 21, 7004, 467, 17, 125, 16, 158, 104, 267, 1, 5596, 4385, 92, 5132, 1, 8, 50302, 3616, 2, 8, 39320, 3616, 4, 3, 50302, 3616, 1823, 2, 154, 148, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 6783, 3, 5596, 6545, 4, 3, 39320, 3616, 1823, 4, 150, 5, 142, 148, 1, 2163, 2848, 2915, 4843, 457, 1, 2520, 37, 2, 136, 4030, 237, 3, 4984, 408, 5596, 8005, 1918, 3525, 6, 7033, 480, 56, 21, 206, 229, 189, 422, 6, 1433, 5515, 1, 7033, 4, 8005, 9, 3, 1070, 1, 9496, 1, 2015, 37, 237, 7033, 2, 6, 4223, 1381, 1, 2015, 37, 1205, 1, 8005, 46, 422, 1304, 910, 2, 457, 2, 631, 5745, 2015, 37, 6, 56, 1368, 21, 4754, 38, 143, 1, 235, 17, 24165, 7033, 4, 5596, 8005, 6, 8602, 136, 3525, 480, 56]",1515.0,28363872,Novel therapeutic strategies target leukemic hijack compartmentalized continuous hematopoietic stem niches,2,0.002185792349726776
Overall survival with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias with the T315I mutation.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-04-07,"Effective treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I) are few. The objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) between patients with CML and those with Ph+ ALL who received treatment with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). A post hoc, retrospective, indirect comparison of OS among patients who received single-agent ponatinib in the Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial with those who underwent allo-SCT as reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplant registry, stratified by CML disease phase and Ph+ ALL, was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare OS between intervention groups, adjusting for time from diagnosis to intervention, age, sex, and geographic region; 24-month and 48-month OS rates and median OS were reported. After adjustment for potential confounders, 24-month and 48-month OS rates were significantly higher in patients with chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) who received ponatinib compared with those who underwent allo-SCT (24 months: 84% vs 60.5%, respectively; P = .004; 48 months: 72.7% vs 55.8%, respectively; P = .013), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.84; P = .017). In patients who had accelerated-phase CML, OS rates were not significantly different between the groups (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.20-4.10; P = .889).

Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Adult T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-04-07,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is recommended for patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in second or later complete remission (CR) and high-risk patients in first CR. Given its relative rarity, data on outcomes of HCT for T-ALL are limited. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study using data from 208 adult patients who underwent HCT between 2000 and 2014 to describe outcomes of allogeneic HCT for T-ALL in the contemporary era. The median age at HCT was 37 years, and the majority of patients underwent HCT in CR, using total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative conditioning regimens. One-quarter of the patients underwent alternative donor HCT using a mismatched, umbilical cord blood, or haploidentical donor. With a median follow up of 38 months, overall survival at 5 years was 34%. The corresponding cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse was 26% and 41%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with overall survival were the use of TBI (HR, 0.57; P = .021), age >35 years (HR, 1.55; P = .025), and disease status at HCT (HR, 1.98; P = .005 for relapsed/refractory disease compared with CR).

A phase 1 trial of plerixafor in combination with intensive chemotherapy in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed to determine a tolerable and biologically active dose. Plerixafor was administered daily for 5 days at four dose levels (6, 9, 12, and 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /dose) followed 4 hr later by high-dose cytarabine (every 12 hr) and etoposide (daily). Nineteen patients (13 with AML, 5 with ALL, 1 with MDS) were treated. The most common grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable to plerixafor were febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Plerixafor exposure increased with increasing dose levels and clearance was similar on days 1 and 5. Eighteen patients were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one patient achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): all three had AML. No responses were seen in patients with ALL or MDS. Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts into the peripheral blood in 14 of 16 evaluable patients (median 3.4-fold increase), and the degree of mobilization correlated with surface CXCR4 expression. Plerixafor, in combination with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide, was well tolerated in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias and MDS. While biologic responses were observed, clinical responses in this heavily pretreated cohort were modest.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1012.0,18.0,Plerixafor reversible CXCR4 antagonist inhibits interactions leukemic blasts bone marrow stromal microenvironment enhance chemosensitivity phase 1 trial plerixafor combination intensive chemotherapy children young adults relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS performed determine tolerable biologically active dose Plerixafor administered daily 5 days dose levels 6 9 12 15 mg/m sup 2 /sup /dose followed 4 hr later high-dose cytarabine 12 hr etoposide daily Nineteen patients 13 AML 5 1 MDS treated common grade 3 greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable plerixafor febrile neutropenia hypokalemia dose-limiting toxicities DLTs Plerixafor exposure increased increasing dose levels clearance similar days 1 5 Eighteen patients evaluable response patients achieved complete remission CR patient achieved CR incomplete hematologic recovery CRi AML responses seen patients MDS Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts peripheral blood 14 16 evaluable patients median 3.4-fold increase degree mobilization correlated surface CXCR4 expression Plerixafor combination high-dose cytarabine etoposide tolerated children young adults relapsed/refractory acute leukemias MDS biologic responses observed clinical responses heavily pretreated cohort modest,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5583, 8, 2786, 2318, 3137, 1576, 1286, 59, 2015, 2438, 2, 3, 581, 1126, 995, 2, 68, 1304, 5522, 8, 124, 14, 160, 1, 5583, 4, 150, 5, 1686, 56, 4, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 591, 15, 430, 286, 1275, 62, 286, 533, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 10, 173, 6, 223, 8, 2668, 2, 2665, 544, 61, 5583, 10, 468, 391, 9, 33, 162, 28, 294, 61, 148, 49, 83, 133, 2, 167, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 61, 370, 39, 168, 1559, 20, 64, 61, 1855, 454, 133, 168, 2, 1934, 391, 3498, 7, 233, 5, 329, 33, 5, 62, 14, 5, 1223, 11, 73, 3, 96, 186, 88, 27, 15, 378, 3534, 385, 2971, 6, 5583, 11, 2498, 778, 2, 7799, 125, 11, 77, 61, 817, 385, 2506, 5583, 645, 101, 5, 602, 61, 148, 2, 1960, 10, 288, 23, 162, 14, 2, 33, 3195, 7, 11, 859, 9, 51, 100, 7, 513, 236, 734, 684, 2, 104, 69, 513, 684, 5, 2610, 813, 1602, 6341, 62, 169, 42, 329, 77, 253, 11, 527, 4, 7, 5, 62, 15, 1223, 5583, 7695, 2015, 2438, 237, 3, 672, 315, 4, 213, 1, 245, 859, 7, 52, 27, 39, 1116, 344, 2, 3, 1444, 1, 4030, 438, 5, 1255, 2318, 55, 5583, 4, 150, 5, 64, 61, 1855, 2, 1934, 10, 149, 421, 4, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 591, 430, 286, 2792, 2, 1223, 369, 1283, 253, 11, 164, 38, 253, 4, 26, 2447, 2193, 180, 11, 1721]",1617.0,28409853,phase 1 CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor combination high-dose cytarabine etoposide children relapsed refractory acute leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators Consortium POE 10-03,0,0.0
Effect of cranial irradiation on sperm concentration of adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study†.,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",Hum. Reprod.,2017-06-01,"Does lower dose (<26 Gy) cranial radiation therapy (CRT) used for central nervous system prophylaxis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) adversely affect sperm concentration or morphology? CRT doses <26 Gy had no demonstrable adverse effect on sperm concentration or morphology. Treatment with alkylating agents produces oligospermia and azoospermia in some patients. No prior study has been large enough to evaluate the independent effects of alkylating agents and lower dose (<26 Gy) CRT on sperm concentration or morphology. This cross-sectional study included male adult survivors of pediatric ALL who had received alkylating agent chemotherapy with or without CRT and who enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE) from September 2007 to October 2013. The inclusion criteria were males, ≥18 years of age, ≥10 years after diagnosis, treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for ALL, and received alkylating agent chemotherapy. Semen analyses were performed on 173 of the 241 (78.1%) adult survivors of pediatric ALL who had received alkylating agent chemotherapy with or without CRT. Cumulative alkylating agent treatment was quantified using the cyclophosphamide equivalent dose (CED). Log-binomial multivariable models were used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI. Compared to those without CRT, risk of oligospermia or azoospermia was not increased for CRT <20 Gy (P = 0.95) or 20-26 Gy (P = 0.58). Participants 5-9 years of age at diagnosis compared to those 0-4 years of age (RR = 1.30, 95% CI, 1.05-.61) or those treated with 8-12 g/m2 CED (RR = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.08-3.94) or ≥12 g/m2 CED (RR = 2.12, 95% CI, 1.09-4.12) compared to those treated with >0 to <4 g/m2 CED had an increased risk for oligospermia or azoospermia. Our study relied on the results of one semen analysis. ALL survivors who did not participate in SJLIFE or who declined to submit a semen analysis may also have biased our results regarding the proportion with azoospermia or oligospermia, since those who provided a semen specimen were less likely to have previously fathered children compared to those who did not. The lower rate of previous parenthood among participants may have resulted in a higher observed frequency of azoospermia and oligospermia. Treatment with <26 Gy CRT did not increase the risk of oligospermia or azoospermia, although a CED exceeding 8 g/m2 and an age at diagnosis of 5-9 years did increase risk of oligospermia and azoospermia.

"Impact of sleep, fatigue, and systemic inflammation on neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2017-04-27,"Long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive impairment, which may be associated with fatigue, sleep problems, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. We examined these associations among survivors of childhood ALL treated with chemotherapy only. Survivors of childhood ALL (male, n = 35 and female, n = 35; mean age, 14.3 years [standard deviation, 4.7 years] and mean years from diagnosis, 7.4 years [standard deviation, 1.9 years]) completed neurocognitive testing, behavioral ratings, and reported sleep quality and fatigue symptoms 5 years after diagnosis. Serum was collected concurrently and assayed for interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein. General linear modeling was used to assess associations among biomarkers and functional outcomes, adjusting for age and stratified by sex. Survivors performed worse than population norms on executive function and processing speed and reported more behavioral problems (P < .05 adjusted for multiple comparison). In female survivors, fatigue was associated with poor executive function (r = 0.41; P = .02), processing speed (r = 0.56; P < .001), and attention (r = 0.36-0.55; P < .05). Female survivors with frequent nighttime awakening displayed more inattention (P = .01), hyperactivity (P = .03), and aggression (P = .01). Worse executive function, processing speed, and behavioral symptoms were observed in female survivors with higher levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and hsCRP (P < .05). Male survivors with high levels of TNF-α demonstrated worse organization (P = .03), but no significant associations between neurocognitive outcomes and sleep/fatigue measures were observed. Neurocognitive function in female survivors of childhood ALL appears more susceptible to the effects of sleep disturbance and fatigue. Systemic inflammation may play a role in neurocognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms.

Osteonecrosis of the Shoulders in Pediatric Patients Treated for Leukemia or Lymphoma: Single-Institutional Experience.,Journal of pediatric orthopedics,J Pediatr Orthop,2019-02-01,"Osteonecrosis of the hips and knees is an often debilitating adverse event in children treated with glucocorticoids for leukemia and lymphoma but the impact of shoulder involvement has been understudied. Thus, we investigated the severity and functional impairment of shoulder osteonecrosis in a well-characterized population of pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma. We retrospectively reviewed orthopaedic clinic and physical therapy evaluations to determine range of motion (ROM), pain, and impact of magnetic resonance-defined osteonecrosis (ON) on activities of daily living. Adverse events were classified according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. We identified 35 patients (22 female), median age at cancer diagnosis 14.2 (range, 4.3 to 19) years; median age at ON diagnosis 16.7 (range, 5.5 to 28) years. Median time to last follow-up from diagnosis of primary malignancy was 6.4 (range, 0 to 12.7) years and from diagnosis of ON was 4.0 (range, 0 to 8.9) years. Twenty-two patients had magnetic resonance evidence of ON; 43 shoulders involved at least 30% of the articular surface of the capital humeral epiphyses.Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events mean scores for initial assessments of 55 shoulders (29 patients) showed moderate negative impact of ON on activity of daily living (1.94), decreased ROM limiting athletic activity (0.98), and mild to moderate levels of pain (1.38). Analysis of this group's most recent assessment showed improvement in pain and ON over time, with an average pain grade of 0.58 indicating no pain to mild pain, and 1.37 for ON grade, indicating asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic impact on activities of daily living. We also found minimal worsening average ROM grades (1.11). Shoulder ON is an underappreciated adverse late effect of therapy in children treated for leukemia/lymphoma which can limit quality of life and functionality. In most cases, pain and disability can be improved with treatment.

Understanding predictors of continued long-term pediatric cancer care across the region: A report from the Consortium for New England Childhood Cancer Survivors.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-04-28,"Many survivors of childhood cancer do not receive recommended longitudinal oncology care. Factors present at the time of childhood cancer diagnosis may identify patients who are vulnerable to poor adherence to follow-up. This cohort of survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed from 1996 to 1999 at seven Consortium for New England Childhood Cancer Survivors institutions was evaluated for attendance at oncology clinics at 5 and 10 years from diagnosis. Demographic, socioeconomic, disease, and treatment characteristics were analyzed as risk factors for nonadherence to follow-up. Of 317 patients, 90% were alive 5 years from diagnosis and 88% of those remained in active follow-up. At 10 years from diagnosis, 88% were alive, 73% of whom continued in active follow-up. Insurance status at diagnosis was significantly associated with adherence at both 5 and 10 years. At 10 years, initial enrollment on therapeutic study was associated with increased attendance and central nervous system (CNS) leukemia with decreased attendance. In multivariable modeling of follow-up at 5 years, patients who were adults were less likely to participate and those with private insurance at diagnosis more likely to participate.

Managing CNS disease in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2017-05-23,The central nervous system (CNS) is an important site of involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults. The prevalence is sufficiently high that prophylactic treatment is routinely given to this sanctuary site in order to eradicate occult disease that might otherwise lead to a relapse. A lumbar puncture should be routinely performed in all newly diagnosed patients with ALL. The risks of CNS leukemia vary by phenotype and genotype. Preventive treatment of the CNS during post-remission therapy has become an integral part of all current ALL treatment protocols. Most treatment regimens combine multiple doses of intrathecal chemotherapy with high-dose systemic methotrexate and/or cytarabine. Cranial irradiation is less commonly used for prophylaxis but is still the most effective treatment for overt CNS leukemia. Recurrences within the CNS usually coincide with or predict soon afterwards for systemic relapse in the marrow and blood.,Journal Article,973.0,5.0,central nervous CNS important site involvement acute lymphoblastic leukemia adults prevalence sufficiently high prophylactic treatment routinely given sanctuary site order eradicate occult disease lead relapse lumbar puncture routinely performed newly diagnosed patients risks CNS leukemia vary phenotype genotype Preventive treatment CNS post-remission therapy integral current treatment protocols treatment regimens combine multiple doses intrathecal chemotherapy high-dose systemic methotrexate and/or cytarabine Cranial irradiation commonly prophylaxis effective treatment overt CNS leukemia Recurrences CNS usually coincide predict soon systemic relapse marrow blood,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 16, 35, 305, 606, 1, 799, 20, 286, 1275, 62, 4, 857, 3, 1078, 16, 5938, 64, 17, 1862, 24, 16, 3066, 447, 6, 26, 14541, 606, 4, 1732, 6, 5650, 2879, 34, 17, 822, 2632, 1122, 6, 8, 429, 8, 6187, 12104, 257, 40, 3066, 173, 4, 62, 732, 265, 7, 5, 62, 3, 1098, 1, 1025, 2825, 20, 1005, 2, 1183, 3494, 24, 1, 3, 1025, 190, 539, 734, 36, 71, 1417, 35, 4450, 760, 1, 62, 291, 62, 24, 2189, 96, 24, 472, 4680, 232, 415, 1, 5126, 56, 5, 64, 61, 403, 2116, 2, 15, 1855, 2565, 1104, 16, 299, 841, 95, 9, 2049, 84, 16, 1234, 3, 96, 323, 24, 9, 7192, 1025, 1593, 262, 3, 1025, 2082, 19664, 5, 15, 678, 6176, 20509, 9, 403, 429, 4, 3, 581, 2, 315]",916.0,28535095,Managing CNS disease adults acute lymphoblastic leukemia,370,0.40437158469945356
Germline ETV6 mutations and predisposition to hematological malignancies.,International journal of hematology,Int. J. Hematol.,2017-05-29,"Patients with thrombocytopenia 5 have an autosomal dominant disorder of decreased platelet number with tendency to bleed, usually presenting in childhood, and have been found to have germline mutations in ETV6, which encodes a master hematopoietic transcription factor. Some patients who present similarly have inherited mutations in RUNX1 or ANKRD26. All three germline syndromes are also associated with a predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL). Since the first description of germline ETV6 mutations, 18 families have been reported. The common phenotype is mild to moderate thrombocytopenia with a variable predisposition to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and MDS. This review will focus upon the role of ETV6 in hematopoiesis, especially in myeloid differentiation and maturation, and will describe the functional effects of mutant ETV6.

mTORC1 Inhibition Induces Resistance to Methotrexate and 6-Mercaptopurine in Ph<sup>+</sup> and Ph-like B-ALL.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2017-05-31,"Elevated activity of mTOR is associated with poor prognosis and higher incidence of relapse in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Thus, ongoing clinical trials are testing mTOR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in B-ALL. However, the combination of mTOR inhibitors with standard of care chemotherapy drugs has not been studied extensively in high-risk B-ALL subtypes. Therefore, we tested whether mTOR inhibition can augment the efficacy of current chemotherapy agents in Ph<sup>+</sup> and Ph-like B-ALL models. Surprisingly, inhibiting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protected B-ALL cells from killing by methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, two antimetabolite drugs used in maintenance chemotherapy. The cytoprotective effects correlated with decreased cell-cycle progression and were recapitulated using cell-cycle inhibitors, palbociclib or aphidicolin. Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently used in Ph<sup>+</sup> patients, inhibits ABL kinase upstream of mTOR. Dasatinib resistance is mainly caused by ABL kinase mutations, but is also observed in a subset of ABL unmutated cases. We identified dasatinib-resistant Ph+ cell lines and patient samples in which dasatinib can effectively reduce ABL kinase activity and mTORC1 signaling without causing cell death. In these cases, dasatinib protected leukemia cells from killing by 6-mercaptopurine. Using xenograft models, we observed that mTOR inhibition or dasatinib increased the numbers of leukemia cells that emerge after cessation of chemotherapy treatment. These results demonstrate that inhibitors targeting mTOR or upstream signaling nodes should be used with caution when combined with chemotherapeutic agents that rely on cell-cycle progression to kill B-ALL cells. <i>Mol Cancer Ther; 16(9); 1942-53. ©2017 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,965.0,4.0,Elevated activity mTOR associated poor prognosis higher incidence relapse B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL ongoing clinical trials testing mTOR inhibitors combination chemotherapy B-ALL combination mTOR inhibitors standard care chemotherapy drugs studied extensively high-risk B-ALL subtypes tested mTOR inhibition augment efficacy current chemotherapy agents Ph sup /sup Ph-like B-ALL models Surprisingly inhibiting mTOR complex 1 mTORC1 protected B-ALL killing methotrexate 6-mercaptopurine antimetabolite drugs maintenance chemotherapy cytoprotective effects correlated decreased cell-cycle progression recapitulated cell-cycle inhibitors palbociclib aphidicolin Dasatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently Ph sup /sup patients inhibits ABL kinase upstream mTOR Dasatinib resistance mainly caused ABL kinase observed subset ABL unmutated cases identified dasatinib-resistant Ph+ lines patient dasatinib effectively reduce ABL kinase activity mTORC1 signaling causing death cases dasatinib protected leukemia killing 6-mercaptopurine xenograft models observed mTOR inhibition dasatinib increased numbers leukemia emerge cessation chemotherapy treatment demonstrate inhibitors targeting mTOR upstream signaling nodes caution combined chemotherapeutic agents rely cell-cycle progression kill B-ALL Mol Ther 16 9 1942-53 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[804, 128, 1, 873, 16, 41, 5, 334, 356, 2, 142, 287, 1, 429, 4, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 631, 942, 38, 143, 32, 471, 873, 222, 4, 150, 5, 56, 4, 132, 62, 137, 3, 150, 1, 873, 222, 5, 260, 1, 165, 56, 600, 71, 44, 85, 656, 3576, 4, 64, 43, 132, 62, 814, 673, 21, 650, 317, 873, 297, 122, 4369, 3, 209, 1, 291, 56, 183, 4, 2058, 172, 172, 2, 2058, 733, 132, 62, 274, 5819, 2062, 873, 840, 14, 5023, 5541, 132, 62, 37, 29, 3003, 20, 2116, 2, 49, 9223, 100, 12995, 600, 95, 4, 1146, 56, 3, 10677, 176, 438, 5, 340, 31, 417, 91, 2, 11, 8064, 75, 31, 417, 222, 4895, 15, 30489, 1674, 8, 564, 216, 230, 694, 95, 4, 2058, 172, 172, 7, 1576, 1425, 216, 3988, 1, 873, 1674, 251, 16, 2615, 1546, 20, 1425, 216, 138, 84, 16, 120, 164, 4, 8, 697, 1, 1425, 7216, 140, 21, 108, 1674, 436, 2058, 31, 285, 2, 69, 347, 4, 92, 1674, 122, 1856, 969, 1425, 216, 128, 2, 5023, 314, 187, 3440, 31, 273, 4, 46, 140, 1674, 5541, 37, 29, 3003, 20, 49, 9223, 75, 1330, 274, 21, 164, 17, 873, 297, 15, 1674, 101, 3, 1870, 1, 37, 17, 6371, 50, 3345, 1, 56, 24, 46, 99, 608, 17, 222, 529, 873, 15, 3988, 314, 502, 257, 40, 95, 5, 5526, 198, 397, 5, 1573, 183, 17, 5533, 23, 31, 417, 91, 6, 5097, 132, 62, 37, 70, 5824, 12, 7770, 245, 83, 24525, 699, 3194, 1630, 70]",1737.0,28566433,mTORC1 Inhibition Induces Resistance Methotrexate 6-Mercaptopurine Ph sup /sup Ph-like B-ALL,5,0.00546448087431694
Whole-exome sequencing identified genetic risk factors for asparaginase-related complications in childhood ALL patients.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-07-01,"Allergy, pancreatitis and thrombosis are common side-effects of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment that are associated with the use of asparaginase (ASNase), a key component in most ALL treatment protocols. Starting with predicted functional germline variants obtained through whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of the Quebec childhood ALL cohort we performed exome-wide association studies with ASNase-related toxicities. A subset of top-ranking variants was further confirmed by genotyping (N=302) followed by validation in an independent replication group (N=282); except for thrombosis which was not available for that dataset. SNPs in 12 genes were associated with ASNase complications in discovery cohort including 3 that were associated with allergy, 3 with pancreatitis and 6 with thrombosis. The risk was further increased through combined SNPs effect (p≤0.002), suggesting synergistic interactions between the SNPs identified in each of the studied toxicities. Interestingly, rs3809849 in the MYBBP1A gene was associated with allergy (p= 0.0006), pancreatitis (p=0.002), thrombosis (p=0.02), event-free survival (p=0.02) and overall survival (p=0.003).

Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in older adults: now and the future.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2017-04-01,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an uncommon disease with poor outcomes in older patients. Although intensive chemotherapy can induce complete responses in older patients, the mortality rate is unacceptably high. The 5-year survival rate for patients achieving a remission ranges from 17% to 23%. ALL is usually more aggressive in older patients, and these patients' reduced functional capacity renders them less able to tolerate treatment. The need for less-intensive, more-efficient treatment modalities in this population of frail and high-risk patients is evident. Clinicians should strongly consider treatment in clinical trials for their older patients. If such trials are not available on site, physicians should refer older patients to tertiary centers for possible enrollment in a study. Significant advances have been made in the past decade toward understanding the biology of ALL and in developing novel therapeutic agents. Blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and newer-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors appear to be promising agents. Clinical studies show remarkable results with these agents, either alone or in combination with low-dose chemotherapy. Now that clinical trials are being designed with less-intensive treatment regimens and broad entry criteria, older age is less likely to be an exclusionary factor.

TP53 mutation does not confer a poor outcome in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are treated with frontline hyper-CVAD-based regimens.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-06-13,"Tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations are uncommon in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and predict a poor outcome. TP53 mutation analysis was performed in 164 newly diagnosed adult patients with ALL using a combination of targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. TP53 mutations were detected in 25 patients (15%), with a median allelic frequency of 42.2% (range, 5.6%-93.8%). The majority of mutations were single-nucleotide variants of missense type and involved the DNA-binding domain. TP53-mutated (TP53<sup>mut</sup> ) ALL was found to be significantly associated with older age, lower median white blood cell and platelet counts, lower frequency of Philadelphia chromosome and a higher frequency of low hypodiploid karyotype compared with ALL with wild-type TP53 (TP53<sup>wt</sup> ). To evaluate the prognostic effect of TP53 mutations, the authors selected 146 patients with B-cell immunophenotype ALL (24 with TP53<sup>mut</sup> and 122 with TP53<sup>wt</sup> ) who were uniformly treated with frontline hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD)-based regimens; >90% of these individuals also received a monoclonal antibody. Over a median follow-up duration of 15 months, there was no significant difference in the median overall survival, event-free survival, and duration of complete remission noted between patients with TP53<sup>mut</sup> ALL and those with TP53<sup>wt</sup> ALL.

Genetics of pleiotropic effects of dexamethasone.,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,Pharmacogenet. Genomics,2017-08-01,"Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone have pleiotropic effects, including desired antileukemic, anti-inflammatory, or immunosuppressive effects, and undesired metabolic or toxic effects. The most serious adverse effects of dexamethasone among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are osteonecrosis and thrombosis. To identify inherited genomic variation involved in these severe adverse effects, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by analyzing 14 pleiotropic glucocorticoid phenotypes in 391 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We used the Projection Onto the Most Interesting Statistical Evidence integrative analysis technique to identify genetic variants associated with pleiotropic dexamethasone phenotypes, stratifying for age, sex, race, and treatment, and compared the results with conventional single-phenotype GWAS. The phenotypes were osteonecrosis, central nervous system toxicity, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, thrombosis, dexamethasone exposure, BMI, growth trajectory, and levels of cortisol, albumin, and asparaginase antibodies, and changes in cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins after dexamethasone. The integrative analysis identified more pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphism variants (P=1.46×10(-215), and these variants were more likely to be in gene-regulatory regions (P=1.22×10(-6)) than traditional single-phenotype GWAS. The integrative analysis yielded genomic variants (rs2243057 and rs6453253) in F2RL1, a receptor that functions in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation, which were associated with pleiotropic effects, including osteonecrosis and thrombosis, and were in regulatory gene regions.

The novel phospholipid mimetic KPC34 is highly active against preclinical models of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-23,"Philadelphia chromosome positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is an aggressive cancer of the bone marrow. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved outcomes but many patients still suffer relapse and novel therapeutic agents are needed. KPC34 is an orally available, novel phospholipid conjugate of gemcitabine, rationally designed to overcome multiple mechanisms of resistance, inhibit the classical and novel isoforms of protein kinase C, is able to cross the blood brain barrier and is orally bioavailable. KPC34 had an IC50 in the nanomolar range against multiple ALL cell lines tested but was lowest for Ph+ lines. In mice bearing either naïve or resistant Ph+ ALL, KPC34 treatment resulted in significantly improved survival compared to cytarabine and gemcitabine. Treatment with KPC34 and doxorubicin was more effective than doxorubicin and cytarabine.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Clinical Practice.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2017-08-01,"Over half of patients diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develop relapsed or refractory disease. Traditional chemotherapy salvage is inadequate, and new therapies are needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a novel, immunologic approach where T cells are genetically engineered to express a CAR conferring specificity against a target cell surface antigen, most commonly the pan-B-cell marker CD19. After infusion, CAR T cells expand and persist, allowing ongoing tumor surveillance. Several anti-CD19 CAR T cell constructs have induced high response rates in heavily pre-treated populations, although durability of response varied. Severe toxicity (cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity) is the primary constraint to broad implementation of CAR T cell therapy. Here, we review the experience of CAR T cell therapy for ALL and ongoing efforts to modify existing technology to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity.

Novel variants in <i>NUDT15</i> and thiopurine intolerance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from diverse ancestry.,Blood,Blood,2017-06-28,"Prolonged exposure to thiopurines (eg, mercaptopurine [MP]) is essential for curative therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but is also associated with frequent dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicities, which is partly explained by inherited genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes (eg, <i>TPMT</i>). Recently, our group and others identified germ line genetic variants in <i>NUDT15</i> as another major cause of thiopurine-related myelosuppression, particularly in Asian and Hispanic people. In this article, we describe 3 novel <i>NUDT15</i> coding variants (p.R34T, p.K35E, and p.G17_V18del) in 5 children with ALL enrolled in frontline protocols in Singapore, Taiwan, and at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Patients carrying these variants experienced significant toxicity and reduced tolerance to MP across treatment protocols. Functionally, all 3 variants led to partial to complete loss of NUDT15 nucleotide diphosphatase activity and negatively influenced protein stability. In particular, the p.G17_V18del variant protein showed extremely low thermostability and was completely void of catalytic activity, thus likely to confer a high risk of thiopurine intolerance. This in-frame deletion was only seen in African and European patients, and is the first <i>NUDT15</i> risk variant identified in non-Asian, non-Hispanic populations. In conclusion, we discovered 3 novel loss-of-function variants in <i>NUDT15</i> associated with MP toxicity, enabling more comprehensive pharmacogenetics-based thiopurine dose adjustments across diverse populations.",Journal Article,937.0,31.0,Prolonged exposure thiopurines mercaptopurine MP essential curative therapy acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated frequent dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicities partly explained inherited genetic polymorphisms drug metabolizing enzymes TPMT /i Recently group identified germ line genetic NUDT15 /i major cause thiopurine-related myelosuppression particularly Asian Hispanic people article 3 novel NUDT15 /i coding p.R34T p.K35E p.G17_V18del 5 children enrolled frontline protocols Singapore Taiwan St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital Patients carrying experienced significant toxicity reduced tolerance MP treatment protocols Functionally 3 led partial complete loss NUDT15 nucleotide diphosphatase activity negatively influenced stability particular p.G17_V18del showed extremely low thermostability completely void catalytic activity likely confer high risk thiopurine intolerance in-frame deletion seen African European patients NUDT15 /i risk identified non-Asian non-Hispanic populations discovered 3 novel loss-of-function NUDT15 /i associated MP toxicity enabling comprehensive pharmacogenetics-based thiopurine dose adjustments diverse populations,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1069, 645, 6, 39767, 2887, 9223, 4545, 16, 1452, 9, 1075, 36, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 84, 16, 120, 41, 5, 908, 61, 817, 1007, 385, 92, 16, 5180, 3672, 20, 2986, 336, 1203, 4, 234, 9800, 3039, 2887, 70, 14852, 70, 761, 114, 87, 2, 1749, 108, 2280, 328, 336, 839, 4, 70, 18089, 70, 22, 1809, 458, 708, 1, 14062, 139, 2858, 823, 4, 2399, 2, 1776, 3788, 4, 26, 946, 21, 897, 27, 229, 70, 18089, 70, 3097, 839, 19, 70717, 19, 70718, 2, 19, 41811, 50471, 4, 33, 541, 5, 62, 346, 4, 3171, 2189, 4, 15622, 9033, 2, 28, 3062, 4841, 541, 292, 389, 702, 7, 2934, 46, 839, 592, 93, 155, 2, 405, 2614, 6, 4545, 716, 24, 2189, 3772, 62, 27, 839, 836, 6, 450, 6, 236, 407, 1, 18089, 1579, 49571, 128, 2, 2723, 2574, 178, 2769, 4, 1454, 3, 19, 41811, 50471, 1142, 178, 224, 2938, 154, 70719, 2, 10, 2500, 25489, 1, 4784, 128, 631, 322, 6, 2913, 8, 64, 43, 1, 14062, 5266, 26, 4, 5331, 1528, 10, 158, 527, 4, 1410, 2, 1865, 7, 2, 16, 3, 157, 70, 18089, 70, 43, 1142, 108, 4, 220, 2399, 220, 1776, 1184, 4, 1221, 21, 2747, 27, 229, 407, 1, 343, 839, 4, 70, 18089, 70, 41, 5, 4545, 155, 5257, 80, 949, 8759, 90, 14062, 61, 6017, 716, 1867, 1184]",1528.0,28659275,Novel NUDT15 /i thiopurine intolerance children acute lymphoblastic leukemia diverse ancestry,0,0.0
Craniospinal irradiation prior to stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies with CNS involvement: Effectiveness and toxicity after photon or proton treatment.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2017-05-10,"Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) improves local control of leukemia/lymphoma with central nervous system (CNS) involvement; however, for adult patients anticipating stem cell transplant (SCT), cumulative treatment toxicity is a major concern. We evaluated toxicities and outcomes for patients receiving proton or photon CSI before SCT. We identified 37 consecutive leukemia/lymphoma patients with CNS involvement who received CSI before SCT at our institution. Photon versus proton toxicities during CSI, transplant, and through 100 days posttransplant were compared using Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Long-term neurotoxicity, disease response, and overall survival were analyzed. Thirty-seven patients (23 photon, 14 proton) underwent CSI for CNS involvement of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49%), acute myeloblastic leukemia (22%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), chronic myelocytic leukemia (14%), lymphoma (11%), and myeloma (3%). CSI was used for consolidation (30 patients, 81%) and gross disease treatment (7 patients, 19%). Median radiation dose (interquartile range) was 24 Gy (23.4-24) for photons and 21.8 Gy (21.3-23.6) for protons (P = .03). Proton CSI was associated with lower rates of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-3 mucositis during CSI (7% vs 44%, P = .03): 1 grade 3 with protons versus 5 grade 1, 3 grade 2, and 2 grade 3 with photons. During CSI, other toxicities (infection, gastrointestinal symptoms) did not differ. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) was used in 95% of patients, with 53% of patients in remission before SCT. Myeloablative conditioning was used for 76%. During SCT admission and 100 days post-SCT, toxicities did not differ by CSI technique. Successful engraftment occurred in 95% of patients (P = .67). Progression or death occurred for 47% of patients, with only 1 CNS relapse. In our cohort, CSI offered excellent local control for CNS-involved hematologic malignancies in the pre-SCT setting.

The genomic landscape of pediatric and young adult T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2017-07-03,"Genetic alterations that activate NOTCH1 signaling and T cell transcription factors, coupled with inactivation of the INK4/ARF tumor suppressors, are hallmarks of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but detailed genome-wide sequencing of large T-ALL cohorts has not been carried out. Using integrated genomic analysis of 264 T-ALL cases, we identified 106 putative driver genes, half of which had not previously been described in childhood T-ALL (for example, CCND3, CTCF, MYB, SMARCA4, ZFP36L2 and MYCN).

Lymphoma,2017-07-11,"Outcomes of relapsed adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved over time with the introduction of new therapies as well as better supportive care. However, there is still a need for easy-to-use and accurate prognostic tools for patients in first relapse. Whether complete response (CR) with incomplete count recovery (CRh) can be grouped with CR in relapsed ALL trials has not been formally studied. We analyzed 106 ALL patients at first relapse who were treated at three academic centers and achieved CR/CRh. White blood cell count at initial diagnosis and receiving hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) were independent predictors of overall survival after relapse, while minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity and performance of HCT were predictors of relapse free survival (RFS).

We identified 70 publications reporting 45 SNPs in 36 genes significantly associated with disease-related mortality, progression-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and/or overall survival after BMT. Replication and validation of these SNP associations were performed using DISCOVeRY-BMT (Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT), a well-powered genome-wide association study consisting of 2 cohorts, totaling 2888 BMT recipients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, and their HLA-matched unrelated donors, reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Gene-based tests were used to assess the aggregate effect of SNPs on outcome. None of the previously reported significant SNPs replicated at <i>P</i> < .05 in DISCOVeRY-BMT. Validation analyses showed association with one previously reported donor SNP at <i>P</i> < .05 and survival; more associations would be anticipated by chance alone. No gene-based tests were significant at <i>P</i> < .05. Functional annotation with publicly available data shows these candidate SNPs most likely do not have biochemical function; only 13% of candidate SNPs correlate with gene expression or are predicted to impact transcription factor binding.

Philadelphia Chromosome-like Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2017-08-01,"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a recently described B-cell precursor ALL with a gene expression profile and a high frequency of IKZF1 gene alteration similar to that of Ph-positive ALL. Its prevalence is approximately 12% in children, 21% in adolescents (16-20 years of age), and 20% to 24% in adults older than 40 years, with a peak (27%) in young adults 21 to 39 years old. It occurs more often in male individuals and patients with Down syndrome. Ph-like ALL is overrepresented in those with Hispanic ethnicity and is associated with inherited genetic variants in GATA3 (rs3824662). It is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous subtype of B-ALL. Although most patients with Ph-like ALL have positive minimal residual disease after remission induction and poor event-free survival, approximately 40% of pediatric patients responded well to chemotherapy and can be cured with relatively low intensity of treatment. The treatment outcome correlated negatively with increasing age at presentation.

Salvage Chemoimmunotherapy With Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Combined With Mini-Hyper-CVD for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Phase 2 Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-02-01,"The outcome of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is poor. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, a CD22 monoclonal antibody bound to calicheamicin, has single-agent activity in R/R ALL. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin plus low-intensity chemotherapy in patients with R/R ALL. A single-arm, phase 2 study of adults with R/R B-cell ALL conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. The chemotherapy used was lower intensity than hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin [trade name, Adriamycin; Pfizer], and dexamethasone) and is referred to as mini-hyper-CVD (mini-HCVD: cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, and cytarabine at 0.5 g/m2 × 4 doses). Inotuzumab was given on day 3 of the first 4 courses at 1.8 to 1.3 mg/m2 for cycle 1 followed by 1.3 to 1.0 mg/m2 for subsequent cycles. The primary end points were the overall response rate and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included safety, relapse-free survival (RFS), the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), and the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate. Fifty-nine patients (30 women and 29 men) with a median age of 35 years (range, 18-87 years) were treated. Overall, 46 patients (78%) responded, 35 of them (59%) achieving complete response. The overall MRD negativity rate among responders was 82%. Twenty-six patients (44%) received ASCT. Grade 3 to 4 toxic effects included prolonged thrombocytopenia (81%; n = 48), infections (73%; n = 43), and hyperbilirubinemia (14%; n = 8). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in 9 patients (15%). With a median follow-up of 24 months, the median RFS and OS were 8 and 11 months, respectively. The 1-year RFS and OS rates were 40% and 46%, respectively. The 1-year OS rates for patients treated in salvage 1, salvage 2, and salvage 3 or beyond were 57%, 26%, and 39%, respectively (P = .03). The combination of inotuzumab with low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy shows encouraging results in R/R ALL. The risk of VOD should be considered carefully in patients with previous liver damage and among transplant candidates. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01371630.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",719.0,46.0,outcome patients relapsed refractory R/R acute lymphoblastic leukemia poor Inotuzumab ozogamicin CD22 monoclonal antibody bound calicheamicin single-agent activity R/R evaluate efficacy safety inotuzumab ozogamicin plus low-intensity chemotherapy patients R/R single-arm phase 2 adults R/R B-cell conducted University Texas MD Anderson Center Houston chemotherapy lower intensity hyper-CVAD cyclophosphamide vincristine doxorubicin trade Adriamycin Pfizer dexamethasone referred mini-hyper-CVD mini-HCVD cyclophosphamide dexamethasone 50 dose reduction anthracycline methotrexate 75 dose reduction cytarabine 0.5 g/m2 4 doses Inotuzumab given day 3 4 courses 1.8 1.3 mg/m2 cycle 1 followed 1.3 1.0 mg/m2 subsequent cycles primary end points overall response rate overall survival OS Secondary end points included safety relapse-free survival RFS rate allogeneic stem transplantation ASCT minimal residual disease MRD negativity rate Fifty-nine patients 30 women 29 men median age 35 years range 18-87 years treated Overall 46 patients 78 responded 35 59 achieving complete response overall MRD negativity rate responders 82 Twenty-six patients 44 received ASCT Grade 3 4 toxic effects included prolonged thrombocytopenia 81 n 48 infections 73 n 43 hyperbilirubinemia 14 n 8 Veno-occlusive disease VOD occurred 9 patients 15 median follow-up 24 months median RFS OS 8 11 months respectively 1-year RFS OS rates 40 46 respectively 1-year OS rates patients treated salvage 1 salvage 2 salvage 3 57 26 39 respectively P .03 combination inotuzumab low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy shows encouraging R/R risk VOD considered carefully patients previous liver damage transplant candidates clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT01371630,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 668, 668, 286, 1275, 62, 16, 334, 6730, 5566, 8, 7599, 848, 548, 2951, 6, 13499, 71, 226, 420, 128, 4, 668, 668, 62, 6, 376, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 6730, 5566, 349, 154, 837, 56, 4, 7, 5, 668, 668, 62, 8, 226, 475, 124, 18, 45, 1, 857, 5, 668, 668, 132, 31, 62, 426, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 6212, 3, 56, 95, 10, 280, 837, 76, 4855, 5574, 1112, 2132, 856, 10550, 9812, 7700, 8982, 2, 1217, 2, 16, 1995, 6, 22, 7313, 4855, 5264, 7313, 32786, 1112, 2, 1217, 28, 212, 61, 628, 77, 2044, 2116, 28, 481, 61, 628, 2, 1855, 28, 13, 33, 499, 821, 39, 415, 6730, 10, 447, 23, 218, 27, 1, 3, 157, 39, 1993, 28, 14, 66, 6, 14, 27, 81, 821, 9, 417, 14, 370, 20, 14, 27, 6, 14, 13, 81, 821, 9, 706, 410, 3, 86, 396, 862, 11, 3, 63, 51, 116, 2, 63, 25, 118, 568, 396, 862, 159, 367, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 3, 116, 1, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 1584, 2, 3, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 6014, 116, 1461, 762, 7, 201, 117, 2, 462, 325, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 465, 60, 184, 203, 912, 60, 11, 73, 63, 641, 7, 833, 2211, 465, 1, 1370, 728, 1785, 236, 51, 3, 63, 2029, 6014, 116, 107, 1983, 10, 878, 737, 437, 7, 584, 103, 1584, 88, 27, 6, 39, 1812, 176, 159, 1069, 1340, 865, 78, 576, 1875, 803, 78, 601, 2, 7236, 213, 78, 66, 10273, 8376, 34, 8768, 489, 4, 83, 7, 167, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 259, 53, 3, 52, 1272, 2, 118, 11, 66, 2, 175, 53, 106, 3, 14, 111, 1272, 2, 118, 151, 11, 327, 2, 641, 106, 3, 14, 111, 118, 151, 9, 7, 73, 4, 992, 14, 992, 18, 2, 992, 27, 15, 1654, 11, 696, 432, 2, 587, 106, 19, 680, 3, 150, 1, 6730, 5, 154, 837, 7313, 32786, 56, 1949, 2269, 99, 4, 668, 668, 62, 3, 43, 1, 8768, 257, 40, 515, 3900, 4, 7, 5, 698, 1350, 2, 107, 941, 1931, 1252, 1239, 3719, 50549]",2140.0,28859185,Salvage Chemoimmunotherapy Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Combined Mini-Hyper-CVD Patients Relapsed Refractory Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Phase 2 Clinical Trial,1,0.001092896174863388

Blinatumomab is a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody with clinical activity as single-agent in the relapsed setting and independent of BCR-ABL1 mutational status, including T315I. The combination of blinatumomab with a TKI may further improve outcomes for this high-risk population, including higher eradication of minimal residual disease and minimize the use of chemotherapy. We retrospectively studied 12 adults with relapsed/refractory Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 9) and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (n = 3), treated with the combination blinatumomab and a TKI (ponatinib, n = 8; dasatinib, n = 3; bosutinib, n = 1). All patients have previously failed at least 1 line of chemotherapy, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and 1 class of TKIs. Patients were treated for either overt hematologic relapse (n = 6) or persistent minimal residual disease following other regimens (n = 6). The complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response rates were 50% (3/6), 71% (5/7), and 75% (9/12), respectively. Two cases of grade 2 cytokine release syndrome were observed, all of which resolved with steroids and tocilizumab. No cardiovascular adverse events were encountered. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the median survival was not reached; the 6-month and 1-year overall survival rates were 73%.

Current paradigms in the management of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-10-31,"Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a biologically, clinically, and genetically distinct subtype of precursor-B ALL. The Ph chromosome, results from a reciprocal translocation of the ABL1 kinase gene on chromosome 9 to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22. Depending on the translocation breakpoint, typically a p210 BCR-ABL1 or a p190 BCR-ABL onc protein are generated; both are constitutively active tyrosine kinases that play a central role to alter signaling pathways of cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal, leading to leukemogenesis. In Ph-positive ALL, the p190-BCR-ABL (minor [m]-bcr) subtype is more frequent than the p210-BCR-ABL (major [M]-bcr) subtype, commonly found in chronic myeloid leukemia. The Philadelphia chromosome is the most frequent recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in elderly patients with ALL. Its incidence increases with age, reaching ∼50% in patients with ALL aged 60 years and over. Patients traditionally had a very poor outcome with chemotherapy, particularly if they do not undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in first complete remission (CR1). With the availability of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding quickly. However, there is no consensus on how to best treat Ph-positive ALL. With modern therapy, improved outcomes have led to the emergence of a number of controversies, including the need for intensive chemotherapy, the ideal TKI, and whether all eligible patients should receive an allo-HSCT, and if so, what type.

"TOX Regulates Growth, DNA Repair, and Genomic Instability in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.",Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2017-10-03,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of thymocytes. Using a transgenic screen in zebrafish, thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) was uncovered as a collaborating oncogenic driver that accelerated T-ALL onset by expanding the initiating pool of transformed clones and elevating genomic instability. TOX is highly expressed in a majority of human T-ALL and is required for proliferation and continued xenograft growth in mice. Using a wide array of functional analyses, we uncovered that TOX binds directly to KU70/80 and suppresses recruitment of this complex to DNA breaks to inhibit nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Impaired NHEJ is well known to cause genomic instability, including development of T-cell malignancies in KU70- and KU80-deficient mice. Collectively, our work has uncovered important roles for TOX in regulating NHEJ by elevating genomic instability during leukemia initiation and sustaining leukemic cell proliferation following transformation.<b>Significance:</b> TOX is an HMG box-containing protein that has important roles in T-ALL initiation and maintenance. TOX inhibits the recruitment of KU70/KU80 to DNA breaks, thereby inhibiting NHEJ repair. Thus, TOX is likely a dominant oncogenic driver in a large fraction of human T-ALL and enhances genomic instability. <i>Cancer Discov; 7(11); 1336-53. ©2017 AACR.</i><i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1201</i>.",Journal Article,840.0,14.0,T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL aggressive malignancy thymocytes transgenic screen zebrafish thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box TOX uncovered collaborating oncogenic driver accelerated T-ALL onset expanding initiating pool transformed clones elevating genomic instability TOX highly expressed majority human T-ALL required proliferation continued xenograft growth mice wide array functional uncovered TOX binds directly KU70/80 suppresses recruitment complex DNA breaks inhibit nonhomologous end joining NHEJ repair Impaired NHEJ known cause genomic instability including development T-cell malignancies KU70- KU80-deficient mice Collectively work uncovered important roles TOX regulating NHEJ elevating genomic instability leukemia initiation sustaining leukemic proliferation following transformation. b Significance /b TOX HMG box-containing important roles T-ALL initiation maintenance TOX inhibits recruitment KU70/KU80 DNA breaks inhibiting NHEJ repair TOX likely dominant oncogenic driver large fraction human T-ALL enhances genomic instability Discov 7 11 1336-53 ©2017 AACR. /i article highlighted Issue feature p. 1201 /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 16, 35, 571, 710, 1, 25586, 75, 8, 2862, 2413, 4, 10763, 16236, 881, 41, 64, 5717, 87, 4971, 178, 16429, 10, 5601, 22, 8, 14977, 1302, 2228, 17, 2241, 102, 62, 1707, 20, 4304, 3, 2637, 6545, 1, 2423, 2749, 2, 16877, 572, 1753, 16429, 16, 561, 570, 4, 8, 686, 1, 171, 102, 62, 2, 16, 616, 9, 457, 2, 1351, 1330, 129, 4, 399, 75, 8, 1019, 1926, 1, 583, 318, 21, 5601, 17, 16429, 3333, 1606, 6, 16360, 493, 2, 4079, 3202, 1, 26, 840, 6, 261, 4492, 6, 1433, 16858, 396, 10690, 12629, 972, 2364, 12629, 16, 149, 440, 6, 708, 572, 1753, 141, 193, 1, 102, 31, 441, 4, 16360, 2, 29257, 1971, 399, 2535, 114, 1357, 71, 5601, 305, 1790, 9, 16429, 4, 2681, 12629, 20, 16877, 572, 1753, 190, 1118, 2, 10100, 2015, 31, 457, 366, 1392, 132, 724, 132, 16429, 16, 35, 13559, 4971, 1101, 178, 17, 71, 305, 1790, 4, 102, 62, 1118, 2, 1146, 16429, 1576, 3, 3202, 1, 16360, 29257, 6, 261, 4492, 2267, 2062, 12629, 972, 631, 16429, 16, 322, 8, 2156, 1302, 2228, 4, 8, 375, 1509, 1, 171, 102, 62, 2, 2519, 572, 1753, 70, 12, 7183, 67, 175, 30358, 699, 3194, 1630, 70, 70, 26, 946, 16, 3681, 4, 3, 4, 26, 2537, 2705, 19, 19100, 70]",1436.0,28974511,TOX Regulates Growth DNA Repair Genomic Instability T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,15,0.01639344262295082

Moxetumomab pasudotox is a recombinant anti-CD22 immunotoxin. A multicenter phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated cumulative dose (MTCD) and evaluate safety, activity, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of moxetumomab pasudotox in children, adolescents, and young adults with ALL (N = 55). Moxetumomab pasudotox was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion at doses of 5 to 50 µg/kg every other day for 6 (cohorts A and B) or 10 (cohort C) doses in 21-day cycles. Cohorts B and C received dexamethasone prophylaxis against capillary leak syndrome (CLS). The most common treatment-related adverse events were reversible weight gain, hepatic transaminase elevation, and hypoalbuminemia. Dose-limiting CLS occurred in 2 of 4 patients receiving 30 µg/kg of moxetumomab pasudotox every other day for 6 doses. Incorporation of dexamethasone prevented further dose-limiting CLS. Six of 14 patients receiving 50 µg/kg of moxetumomab pasudotox for 10 doses developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), or HUS-like events, exceeding the MTCD. Treatment expansion at 40 µg/kg for 10 doses (n = 11) exceeded the MTCD because of 2 HUS/TMA/HUS-like events. Dose level 6B (ie, 50 µg/kg × 6 doses) was the MTCD, selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. Among 47 evaluable patients, an objective response rate of 32% was observed, including 11 (23%) composite complete responses, 5 of which were minimal residual disease negative by flow cytometry. Moxetumomab pasudotox showed a manageable safety profile and evidence of activity in relapsed or refractory childhood ALL.

Levofloxacin Prophylaxis During Induction Therapy for Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clin. Infect. Dis.,2017-11-01,"Infection is the most important cause of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although routine in adults with leukemia, antibacterial prophylaxis is controversial in pediatrics because of insufficient evidence for its efficacy or antibiotic choice and concerns about promoting antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. This was a single-center, observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed ALL, comparing prospectively collected infection-related outcomes in patients who received no prophylaxis, levofloxacin prophylaxis, or other prophylaxis during induction therapy on the total XVI study. A propensity score-weighted logistic regression model was used to adjust for confounders. Of 344 included patients, 173 received no prophylaxis, 69 received levofloxacin prophylaxis, and 102 received other prophylaxis regimens. Patients receiving prophylaxis had longer duration of neutropenia. Prophylaxis reduced the odds of febrile neutropenia, likely bacterial infection, and bloodstream infection by ≥70%. Levofloxacin prophylaxis alone reduced these infections, but it also reduced cephalosporin, aminoglycoside, and vancomycin exposure and reduced the odds of C. difficile infection by >95%. No increase in breakthrough infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms was seen, but this cannot be excluded. This is the largest study to date of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction therapy for pediatric ALL and the first to include a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Prophylaxis prevented febrile neutropenia and systemic infection. Levofloxacin prophylaxis also minimized the use of treatment antibiotics and drastically reduced C. difficile infection. Although long-term antibiotic-resistance monitoring is needed, these data support using targeted prophylaxis with levofloxacin in children undergoing induction chemotherapy for ALL.

Concise Review: Emerging Principles from the Clinical Application of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapies for B Cell Malignancies.,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",Stem Cells,2017-10-25,"Gene-engineered T cell therapies are soon to be United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for at least two types of B cell malignancies in pediatric and adult patients, in the form of CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy. This represents a triumph of a true bench to bedside clinical translation of a therapy that was conceived of in the early 1990s. Clinical results have demonstrated efficacious responses in patients with the CD19 positive diseases B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. However, significant challenges have emerged, including worrisome immune-related toxicities, therapy resistance, and understanding how to administer CD19 CAR T cells in clinical practice.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-10-13,"Therapeutic T cell engineering has recently garnered widespread interest because of the success of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy. CARs are synthetic receptors for antigen that redirect the specificity and reprogram the function of the T cells in which they are genetically introduced. CARs targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule found in most leukemias and lymphomas, have yielded high remission rates in patients with chemorefractory, relapsed disease, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The toxicities of this treatment include B cell aplasia, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and neurotoxicity. Although reversible in most instances, these toxicities may require specific medical interventions, including transfer to intensive care to treat severe CRS. Guidelines for managing these toxicities are emerging. The recent report of a nonhuman primate model for CRS is poised to help advance the management of this syndrome. Finally, new engineering modalities, based on the use of targeted nucleases like CRISPR, may further enhance the efficacy and safety of CAR T cells.",Journal Article,830.0,14.0,Therapeutic engineering recently garnered widespread success CD19 chimeric antigen receptor CAR therapy CARs synthetic receptors antigen redirect specificity reprogram function genetically introduced CARs targeting CD19 surface molecule leukemias lymphomas yielded high remission rates patients chemorefractory relapsed disease including acute lymphoblastic leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia non-Hodgkin lymphoma toxicities treatment include B aplasia cytokine release syndrome CRS neurotoxicity reversible instances toxicities require specific medical interventions including transfer intensive care treat severe CRS Guidelines managing toxicities emerging recent report nonhuman primate model CRS poised help advance management syndrome Finally new engineering modalities based use targeted nucleases like CRISPR enhance efficacy safety CAR,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[189, 102, 31, 6717, 71, 761, 21476, 3029, 1333, 408, 1, 3, 1825, 1, 3158, 2897, 448, 153, 1881, 36, 7441, 32, 3273, 1186, 9, 448, 17, 14744, 3, 1121, 2, 14947, 3, 343, 1, 3, 102, 37, 4, 92, 491, 32, 2301, 3955, 7441, 529, 3158, 8, 31, 1255, 1354, 204, 4, 96, 2792, 2, 1557, 47, 2178, 64, 734, 151, 4, 7, 5, 8923, 591, 34, 141, 286, 1275, 442, 1193, 2, 3, 385, 1, 26, 24, 643, 132, 31, 12307, 1675, 2008, 681, 3115, 2, 3561, 242, 2786, 4, 96, 5342, 46, 385, 68, 1353, 112, 484, 1151, 141, 2602, 6, 1686, 165, 6, 943, 905, 3115, 677, 9, 3969, 46, 385, 32, 1478, 3, 435, 414, 1, 8, 23273, 25233, 202, 9, 3115, 16, 13970, 6, 987, 3148, 3, 284, 1, 26, 681, 1368, 217, 6717, 1558, 90, 23, 3, 119, 1, 238, 36375, 733, 7736, 68, 195, 1304, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 1881, 102, 37]",1085.0,29032264,Building Safer Faster CAR Seatbelts Airbags CRISPR,596,0.6513661202185792

Given its activity in relapsed and refractory T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), we sought to define its role in the frontline treatment of adult patients. Therefore, we conducted a single arm phase 2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of nelarabine in combination with hyper-CVAD in newly diagnosed patients. For induction/consolidation, patients received eight cycles of hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine plus two cycles of nelarabine given at a dose of 650 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously daily for 5 days. This was followed by thirty months of POMP maintenance chemotherapy with two additional cycles of nelarabine given instead of cycles 6 and 7 of POMP maintenance. Sixty-seven patients, including 40 with T-ALL and 26 with T-LBL, were enrolled. Complete response rates in both T-ALL and T-LBL were 87% and 100% respectively. Grade 3 to 4 neurotoxic adverse events were reported in 5 patients. There were 21 relapses (31%) including 2 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Median duration of follow-up was 42.5 months. The 3-year complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 66% and 65%, respectively.

High mTOR expression independently prognosticates poor clinical outcome to induction chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Clinical and experimental medicine,Clin. Exp. Med.,2017-10-26,"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), limited data are available on mTOR gene expression in clinical samples and its role in predicting response to induction chemotherapy. mRNA expression of mTOR gene was determined quantitatively by real-time PCR in 50 ALL patients (30 B-ALL and 20 T-ALL) and correlated with clinical outcome after induction chemotherapy. Expression level of mTOR was upregulated in more than 50% of cases of ALL. In T-ALL, high expression of mTOR was commonly seen, more in adults than children (82 vs. 55% cases), while in B-ALL it was same (~ 63% cases) in both adults and children. Mean fold change of mTOR expression was significantly higher in non-responders compared to responders of both adult B-ALL (7.4 vs. 2.7, p = 0.05) and T-ALL (13.9 vs. 2.4, p = 0.001). Similar results were seen in pediatric non-responders when compared to responders of both B-ALL (14.5 vs. 2.5, p = 0.006) and T-ALL (24.2 vs. 1.7, p = 0.002). Interestingly, we have observed that mTOR expression was two times higher in non-responders of children compared to adults in both B-ALL (14.5 vs. 7.4, p = 0.05) and T-ALL (24.2 vs. 13.9, p = 0.01).

Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from a phase III multicenter study in children and adolescents of 1-18 years with previously untreated ALL. Between 2005 and 2011, 794 eligible patients enrolled on DFCI 05-001, 730 of whom were included in this analysis (19% [N = 150] Hispanic, 73% [N = 580] non-Hispanic). Hispanic patients were more likely to be ≥10 years of age (32% vs. 24%, P = 0.045) at diagnosis. Toxicity analyses revealed that Hispanic patients had significantly lower cumulative incidence of bone fracture (P < 0.001) and osteonecrosis (ON; P = 0.047). In multivariable risk regression, the risk of ON was significantly lower in Hispanic patients ≥10 years (HR 0.23; P = 0.006). Hispanic patients had significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (79.4%; 95% CI: 71.6-85.2) and overall survival (OS) (89.2%; 95% CI: 82.7-93.4) than non-Hispanic patients (EFS: 87.5%; 95% CI: 84.5-90.0, P = 0.004; OS: 92.7%; 95% CI: 90.2-94.6, P = 0.006).

CD38 antibodies in multiple myeloma: back to the future.,Blood,Blood,2017-11-08,"CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and at relatively low levels on normal lymphoid and myeloid cells, and in some tissues of nonhematopoietic origin. CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with ectoenzymatic activity, and also functions as a receptor and adhesion molecule. Altogether, this has triggered the development of several CD38 antibodies including daratumumab (fully human), isatuximab (chimeric), and MOR202 (fully human). CD38 antibodies have pleiotropic mechanisms of action including Fc-dependent immune-effector mechanisms, direct apoptotic activity, and immunomodulatory effects by the elimination of CD38<sup>+</sup> immune-suppressor cells. CD38-targeting antibodies are generally well tolerated and induce partial response or better in ∼30% of heavily pretreated MM patients as monotherapy. Based on their distinct mechanisms of action, favorable toxicity profile, and single-agent activity, CD38 antibodies are attractive partners in combination regimens. Indeed, deep responses and prolonged progression-free survival can be achieved in relapsed/refractory MM patients when CD38 antibodies are combined with immunomodulatory agents or proteasome inhibitors. Infusion-related reactions, which typically occur during the first infusion, are the most frequent adverse events. Attention should also be paid to the interference of CD38 antibodies with certain laboratory assays, which may complicate response evaluation and blood compatibility testing. Several studies are currently examining the role of CD38-based therapies in newly diagnosed and high-risk smoldering MM. Furthermore, CD38 antibodies are currently also under investigation in other hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, as well as in solid tumors.",Journal Article,804.0,60.0,CD38 highly uniformly expressed multiple myeloma MM relatively low levels normal lymphoid myeloid tissues nonhematopoietic origin CD38 transmembrane glycoprotein ectoenzymatic activity functions receptor adhesion molecule Altogether triggered development CD38 antibodies including daratumumab fully human isatuximab chimeric MOR202 fully human CD38 antibodies pleiotropic mechanisms action including Fc-dependent immune-effector mechanisms direct apoptotic activity immunomodulatory effects elimination CD38 sup /sup immune-suppressor CD38-targeting antibodies generally tolerated induce partial response better ∼30 heavily pretreated MM patients monotherapy Based distinct mechanisms action favorable toxicity profile single-agent activity CD38 antibodies attractive partners combination regimens deep responses prolonged progression-free survival achieved relapsed/refractory MM patients CD38 antibodies combined immunomodulatory agents proteasome inhibitors Infusion-related reactions typically occur infusion frequent adverse events Attention paid interference CD38 antibodies certain laboratory complicate response evaluation blood compatibility testing studies currently examining role CD38-based therapies newly diagnosed high-risk smoldering MM Furthermore CD38 antibodies currently investigation hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia natural killer/T-cell lymphoma acute myeloid leukemia solid,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4469, 16, 561, 2, 4254, 570, 23, 232, 321, 37, 2, 28, 1352, 154, 148, 23, 295, 2303, 2, 533, 37, 2, 4, 476, 742, 1, 19463, 1938, 4469, 16, 8, 5527, 4455, 5, 71506, 128, 2, 120, 1681, 22, 8, 153, 2, 2128, 1354, 6767, 26, 71, 4173, 3, 193, 1, 392, 4469, 890, 141, 6458, 1910, 171, 14054, 2897, 2, 71507, 1910, 171, 4469, 890, 47, 7872, 483, 1, 1578, 141, 4127, 470, 250, 2070, 483, 1196, 1631, 128, 2, 2555, 176, 20, 3, 3730, 1, 4469, 172, 172, 250, 1245, 37, 4469, 529, 890, 32, 1228, 149, 421, 2, 1290, 450, 51, 15, 380, 4, 19254, 1, 2447, 2193, 321, 7, 22, 1411, 90, 23, 136, 834, 483, 1, 1578, 913, 155, 800, 2, 226, 420, 128, 4469, 890, 32, 3059, 4005, 4, 150, 472, 4462, 2369, 253, 2, 1069, 91, 115, 25, 122, 40, 513, 4, 591, 430, 321, 7, 198, 4469, 890, 32, 397, 5, 2555, 183, 15, 1694, 222, 904, 139, 2428, 92, 1969, 1271, 190, 3, 157, 904, 32, 3, 96, 908, 290, 281, 2111, 257, 120, 40, 8328, 6, 3, 3182, 1, 4469, 890, 5, 1840, 1624, 1013, 92, 68, 11157, 51, 451, 2, 315, 22539, 471, 392, 94, 32, 694, 3282, 3, 200, 1, 4469, 90, 235, 4, 732, 265, 2, 64, 43, 7091, 321, 798, 4469, 890, 32, 694, 120, 669, 940, 4, 127, 813, 441, 141, 286, 1275, 1504, 3458, 102, 31, 2, 286, 533, 22, 149, 22, 4, 537, 57]",1776.0,29118010,CD38 antibodies multiple myeloma future,17,0.018579234972677595

Survivors of pediatric brain tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (N = 68) were randomized to intervention (Cogmed) or waitlist control. The intervention group was matched with one of two coaches. Cognitive assessments were completed before and after intervention, and participants and caregivers in the intervention group completed satisfaction surveys. T-tests showed no differences in adherence across coaches (number of sessions completed p = .38; d = .32). Noninferiority statistics were not consistently equivalent for satisfaction, but equivalence was supported for caregiver perceptions of pragmatic utility and participant perceptions of logistical ease of Cogmed. Equivalence was not consistently suggested for cognitive outcomes, but was supported on measures tapping relevant cognitive domains (attention, working memory, processing speed, academic fluency).

Outcome of patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after blinatumomab failure: No change in the level of CD19 expression.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-12-23,"Blinatumomab, a bi-specific T-cell engaging CD3-CD19 antibody construct, has shown significant activity in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Despite this improvement, most patients relapse. Here, we describe the outcome of 68 patients with R/R ALL after failure of blinatumomab therapy: 38 (56%) blinatumomab refractory; 30 (44%) relapsing after initial response. After a median follow-up of 49 months, 9 (13%) patients remained alive. The median overall survival after blinatumomab failure was 5.2 months.

Intravenous Busulfan Compared with Total Body Irradiation Pretransplant Conditioning for Adults with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-12-25,"Total body irradiation (TBI) has been included in standard conditioning for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Non-TBI regimens have incorporated busulfan (Bu) to decrease toxicity. This retrospective study analyzed TBI and Bu on outcomes of ALL patients 18-60 years old, in first or second complete remission (CR), undergoing HLA-compatible sibling, related, or unrelated donor HCT, who reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 2005 to 2014. TBI plus etoposide (25%) or cyclophosphamide (75%) was used in 819 patients, and intravenous Bu plus fludarabine (41%), clofarabine (30%), cyclophosphamide (15%), or melphalan (13%) was used in 299 patients. Bu-containing regimens were analyzed together, since no significant differences for patient outcomes were noted between them. Bu patients were older, with better performance status; took longer to achieve first CR and receive HCT; were treated more recently; and were more likely to receive peripheral blood grafts, antithymocyte globulin, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With median follow-up of 3.6 years for Bu and 5.3 years for TBI, adjusted 3-year outcomes showed treatment-related mortality Bu 19% versus TBI 25% (P = .04); relapse Bu 37% versus TBI 28% (P = .007); disease-free survival (DFS) Bu 45% versus TBI 48% (P = .35); and overall survival (OS) Bu 57% versus TBI 53% (P = .35). In multivariate analysis, Bu patients had higher risk of relapse (relative risk, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.85; P = .002) compared with TBI patients.

Clinical impact of sedentary behaviors in adult survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-12-04,"Sedentary behaviors are associated with poor health outcomes in the general population, but their clinical impact on adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not been characterized to date. In the current study, we described the prevalence of sedentary behaviors in survivors of ALL and examined associations between time spent sedentary and body composition and onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Participants' self-reported screen time (eg, television, computer) and activity as measured by accelerometer were used to determine activity time (sedentary, light activity, and moderate or vigorous physical activity). The percentage of time spent in each activity was compared between 331 survivors of ALL and 330 controls. Associations between time sedentary and body composition were evaluated in survivors using linear regression models. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between time sedentary at baseline and CVD risk factor onset during follow-up. Survivors spent approximately 65% of their time sedentary, 32% in light activity, and 2% in moderate or vigorous physical activity compared with 67% (P = .04), 30% (P<.01), and 3% (P<.01), respectively, in controls. Among survivors, percentage lean body mass decreased by 1.0% ± 0.4% (P = .01) per 10% increase in time sedentary. Survivors who were sedentary ≥60% per day were found to be at an increased risk of high total cholesterol (hazard ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-5.64) and any CVD risk factor (hazard ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.30). Sedentary behavior is associated with low lean mass and CVD risk factor development and should be limited in survivors of childhood ALL.

Current management of Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL and the role of stem cell transplantation.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2017-12-01,"Treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia exemplifies how the addition of potent targeted agents, directed at the molecular aberrations responsible for leukemic transformation, can overcome resistance mechanisms to traditional regimens and lead to improved outcomes. The introduction of <i>BCR-ABL1</i> targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the outcomes not only by allowing more patients to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) but also by decreasing our reliance on this potentially toxic strategy, particularly in the less fit population. Long-term data using chemotherapy and TKI combinations demonstrate that a proportion of patients treated can achieve durable relapse-free survival without undergoing alloHCT. Furthermore, the availability of sensitive minimal residual disease monitoring assays may allow early detection of the patients who are more likely to relapse and who are likely candidates for early alloHCT. The emergence of more potent TKIs with significant activity against resistant mutations has allowed deintensification of chemotherapy regimens. Available data indicate that complete reliance on TKIs, alone or with minimal additional therapy, and elimination of more intensive chemotherapy or alloHCT is unlikely to achieve long term cure in most patients.

Progress in adult ALL: incorporation of new agents to frontline treatment.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2017-12-01,"Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults remains a challenge, as the delivery of intensive chemotherapeutic regimens in this population is less feasible than it is in the pediatric population. This has led to higher rates of treatment-related toxicity as well as lower overall survival in the adult population. Over the past several years, a host of novel therapies (eg, immunotherapy and targeted therapies) with better tolerability than traditional chemotherapy are now being introduced into the relapsed/refractory population with very encouraging results. Additionally, insights into how to choose effective therapies for patients while minimizing drug toxicity through pharmacogenomics and the use of minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring to escalate/de-escalate therapy have enhanced our ability to reduce treatment-related toxicity. This has led to the design of a number of clinical trials which incorporate both novel therapeutics as well as MRD-directed treatment pathways into the frontline setting.

However, data from patients who received treatment on a frontline regimen without cranial irradiation are limited, and no genome-wide analysis has been reported. Lumbar BMD was evaluated by quantitative computed tomography at diagnosis, after 120 weeks of continuation therapy, and after 2 years off therapy in pediatric patients with ALL (ages 2-18 years at diagnosis) who were treated on the St. Jude Total XV Protocol.

Patients who were 1 to 30 years old and had VHR B-ALL received modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster therapy after induction and were randomized to 1) CPM, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, vincristine (VCR), and pegaspargase (control arm), 2) CPM, ETOP, VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 1), or 3) CPM, ETOP, CLOF (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /d × 5), VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 2) during the second half of consolidation and delayed intensification. The rates of grade 4/5 infections and grade 3/4 pancreatitis were significantly increased in experimental arm 2. The dose of CLOF was, therefore, reduced to 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /d × 5, and myeloid growth factor was required after CLOF administration. Despite these changes, 4 of 39 patients (10.3%) developed grade 4 infections, with 1 of these patients developing a grade 5 acute kidney injury attributed to CLOF, whereas only 1 of 46 patients (2.2%) in experimental arm 1 developed grade 4 infections, and there were no grade 4/5 infections in the control arm (n = 20). Four patients in experimental arm 2 had prolonged cytopenias for >60 days, whereas none did in the control arm or experimental arm 1. Counts failed to recover for 2 of these patients, one having a grade 5 acute kidney injury and the other removed from protocol therapy; both events occurred 92 days after the start of consolidation part 2. In AALL1131, CLOF, administered with CPM and ETOP, was associated with unacceptable toxicity.

Pretransplant Consolidation Is Not Beneficial for Adults with ALL Undergoing Myeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-12-21,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is curative for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who achieve complete remission (CR1) with chemotherapy. However, the benefit of consolidation chemotherapy remains uncertain in patients undergoing alloHCT. We compared clinical outcomes of 524 adult patients with ALL in CR1 who received ≥2 (n = 109), 1 (n = 93), or 0 cycles (n = 322) of consolidation before myeloablative alloHCT from 2008 to 2012. As expected, time to alloHCT was longer with increasing cycles of consolidation. Patients receiving ≥2, 1, or 0 cycles of consolidation had an adjusted 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 20%, 27%, and 22%; 1-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) of 16%, 18%, and 23%; adjusted 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 54%, 48%, and 47%; and 3-year overall survival (OS) of 63%, 59%, and 54% (all P values >.40). Multivariable analysis confirmed that consolidation was not prognostic for LFS (relative risk, 1.20, 95% confidence interval, .86 to 1.67; P = .28 for no consolidation; RR, 1.18, 95% confidence interval, .79 to 1.76; P = .41 for 1 cycle versus ≥2 cycles = reference).

Influence of BCL2L11 polymorphism on osteonecrosis during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The pharmacogenomics journal,Pharmacogenomics J.,2017-12-27,"Osteonecrosis (ON) is corticosteroid-related complication, reported in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have previously found that polymorphisms in BCL2L11 gene coding for pro-apoptotic Bim protein influence reduction of overall survival (OS) in a corticosteroid (CS) dose-dependent manner in childhood ALL patients. The same set of SNPs was here investigated for an association with CS-related ON assessed retrospectively in 304 children with ALL from Quebec (QcALL cohort) who received Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL treatment protocols. Two-year cumulative incidence of symptomatic ON was 10.6%. Two BCL2L11 polymorphisms, the 891T>G (rs2241843) in all QcALL patients and 29201C>T (rs724710) in high-risk group were significantly associated with ON, P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively. The association remained significant in multivariate model (HR<sub>891TT</sub> = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8, P = 0.01 and HR<sub>29201CC</sub> = 5.7, 95% CI 1.6-20.9, P = 0.008). Both polymorphisms influenced viability of dexamethasone treated lymphoblastoid cell lines (P ≤ 0.03).

Second primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults: a SEER analysis of incidence and outcomes.,Cancer medicine,Cancer Med,2017-12-28,"We conducted a surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER)-based analysis to describe the incidence and characteristics of second primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL) among adults (≥18 years) with a history of primary malignancies (1M). Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of sALL cases were calculated by site and 1M stage. We also evaluated the differences in 5-year sALL survival by age, site, and extent of 1M, latency of sALL after 1M, and evidence of underlying racial/ethnic disparity. We identified 10,956 patients with de-novo/primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1ALL) and 772 with sALL. Women (49.1% vs. 42.9%), white patients (72.0% vs. 59.5%), older patients (58.8% vs. 25.2%; age ≥65 years), and patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2012 (66.8% vs. 53.9%) had a higher proportion of sALL compared with 1ALL. There was a significantly inferior median 5-year survival for sALL patients compared to 1ALL (6 vs. 15 months; HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.10-1.31, P < 0.001). The median latency period was 60.0 months; the most common 1M among sALL patients were breast (17.9%) and prostate (17.4%). Patients with any 1M were at increased risk of developing sALL (SIR 1.76, 95% CI 1.58-1.95, P < 0.001).

TP53 Germline Variations Influence the Predisposition and Prognosis of B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-01-04,"Purpose Germline TP53 variation is the genetic basis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant cancer predisposition condition. Recent reports of germline TP53 variants in childhood hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggest that this type of leukemia is another manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome; however, the pattern, prevalence, and clinical relevance of TP53 variants in childhood ALL remain unknown. Patients and Methods Targeted sequencing of TP53 coding regions was performed in 3,801 children from the Children's Oncology Group frontline ALL clinical trials, AALL0232 and P9900. TP53 variant pathogenicity was evaluated according to experimentally determined transcriptional activity, in silico prediction of damaging effects, and prevalence in non-ALL control populations. TP53 variants were analyzed for their association with ALL presenting features and treatment outcomes. Results We identified 49 unique nonsilent rare TP53 coding variants in 77 (2.0%) of 3,801 patients sequenced, of which 22 variants were classified as pathogenic. TP53 pathogenic variants were significantly over-represented in ALL compared with non-ALL controls (odds ratio, 5.2; P < .001). Children with TP53 pathogenic variants were significantly older at ALL diagnosis (median age, 15.5 years v 7.3 years; P < .001) and were more likely to have hypodiploid ALL (65.4% v 1.2%; P < .001). Carrying germline TP53 pathogenic variants was associated with inferior event-free survival and overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.2 and 3.9; P < .001 and .001, respectively). In particular, children with TP53 pathogenic variants were at a dramatically higher risk of second cancers than those without pathogenic variants, with 5-year cumulative incidence of 25.1% and 0.7% ( P < .001), respectively.

MBD2 Ablation Impairs Lymphopoiesis and Impedes Progression and Maintenance of T-ALL.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2018-01-12,"Aberrant DNA methylation patterns in leukemia might be exploited for therapeutic targeting. In this study, we employed a genetically deficient mouse model to explore the role of the methylated DNA binding protein MBD2 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. MBD2 ablation led to diminished lymphocytes. Functional defects of the lymphoid compartment were also observed after <i>in vivo</i> reconstitution of MBD2-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). In an established model of Notch1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), MBD2 ablation impeded malignant progression and maintenance by attenuating the Wnt signaling pathway. In clinical specimens of human T-ALL, Wnt signaling pathway signatures were significantly enhanced and positively correlated with the expression and function of MBD2. Furthermore, a number of typical Wnt signaling inhibitory genes were abnormally hypermethylated in primary human T-ALL. Abnormal activation of Wnt signaling in T-ALL was switched off by MBD2 deletion, partially by reactivating epigenetically silenced Wnt signaling inhibitors. Taken together, our results define essential roles for MBD2 in lymphopoiesis and T-ALL and suggest MBD2 as a candidate therapeutic target in T-ALL.<b>Significance:</b> This study highlights a methylated DNA binding protein as a candidate therapeutic target to improve the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, as a new starting point for developing epigenetic therapy in this and other lymphoid malignancies. <i>Cancer Res; 78(7); 1632-42. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,739.0,1.0,Aberrant DNA methylation patterns leukemia exploited therapeutic targeting employed genetically deficient mouse model explore role methylated DNA binding MBD2 normal malignant hematopoiesis MBD2 ablation led diminished lymphocytes Functional defects lymphoid compartment observed vivo /i reconstitution MBD2-deficient hematopoietic stem HSC established model Notch1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL MBD2 ablation impeded malignant progression maintenance attenuating Wnt signaling pathway clinical specimens human T-ALL Wnt signaling pathway signatures significantly enhanced positively correlated expression function MBD2 Furthermore number typical Wnt signaling inhibitory abnormally hypermethylated primary human T-ALL Abnormal activation Wnt signaling T-ALL switched MBD2 deletion partially reactivating epigenetically silenced Wnt signaling inhibitors Taken define essential roles MBD2 lymphopoiesis T-ALL suggest MBD2 candidate therapeutic target T-ALL. b Significance /b highlights methylated DNA binding candidate therapeutic target improve treatment T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias new starting point developing epigenetic therapy lymphoid malignancies Res 78 7 1632-42 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1898, 261, 569, 764, 4, 822, 40, 5177, 9, 189, 529, 4, 26, 45, 21, 2516, 8, 2301, 1971, 830, 202, 6, 1645, 3, 200, 1, 3, 2963, 261, 791, 178, 20784, 4, 295, 2, 393, 5114, 20784, 1650, 836, 6, 2849, 1594, 583, 2945, 1, 3, 2303, 3616, 11, 120, 164, 50, 70, 4, 386, 70, 5616, 1, 20784, 1971, 1007, 452, 37, 5596, 4, 35, 635, 202, 1, 4607, 1621, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 20784, 1650, 15857, 393, 91, 2, 1146, 20, 12102, 3, 2112, 314, 308, 4, 38, 623, 1, 171, 102, 62, 2112, 314, 308, 2210, 11, 97, 651, 2, 2375, 438, 5, 3, 55, 2, 343, 1, 20784, 798, 8, 207, 1, 3476, 2112, 314, 1810, 214, 11, 11749, 6936, 4, 86, 171, 102, 62, 1668, 363, 1, 2112, 314, 4, 102, 62, 10, 7883, 1889, 20, 20784, 1528, 2995, 20, 21425, 8976, 5442, 2112, 314, 222, 1633, 1162, 114, 99, 1107, 1452, 1790, 9, 20784, 4, 30689, 2, 102, 62, 2, 309, 20784, 22, 8, 1609, 189, 283, 4, 102, 62, 132, 724, 132, 26, 45, 2527, 8, 2963, 261, 791, 178, 22, 8, 1609, 189, 283, 6, 401, 3, 24, 1, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 2792, 22, 8, 217, 1723, 741, 9, 931, 1418, 36, 4, 26, 2, 127, 2303, 441, 70, 12, 1936, 833, 67, 43829, 595, 4281, 1630, 70]",1505.0,29330145,MBD2 Ablation Impairs Lymphopoiesis Impedes Progression Maintenance T-ALL,0,0.0

Clinical Cancer Advances 2018: Annual Report on Progress Against Cancer From the American Society of Clinical Oncology.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-01-30,"A MESSAGE FROM ASCO'S PRESIDENT I remember when ASCO first conceived of publishing an annual report on the most transformative research occurring in cancer care. Thirteen reports later, the progress we have chronicled is remarkable, and this year is no different. The research featured in ASCO's Clinical Cancer Advances 2018 report underscores the impressive gains in our understanding of cancer and in our ability to tailor treatments to tumors' genetic makeup. The ASCO 2018 Advance of the Year, adoptive cell immunotherapy, allows clinicians to genetically reprogram patients' own immune cells to find and attack cancer cells throughout the body. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy-a type of adoptive cell immunotherapy-has led to remarkable results in young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in adults with lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Researchers are also exploring this approach in other types of cancer. This advance would not be possible without robust federal investment in cancer research. The first clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy in children with ALL was funded, in part, by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and researchers at the NCI Center for Cancer Research were the first to report on possible CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma. These discoveries follow decades of prior research on immunology and cancer biology, much of which was supported by federal dollars. In fact, many advances that are highlighted in the 2018 Clinical Cancer Advances report were made possible thanks to our nation's support for biomedical research. Funding from the US National Institutes of Health and the NCI helps researchers pursue critical patient care questions and addresses vital, unmet needs that private industry has little incentive to take on. Federally supported cancer research generates the biomedical innovations that fuel the development and availability of new and improved treatments for patients. We need sustained federal research investment to accelerate the discovery of the next generation of cancer treatments. Another major trend in this year's report is progress in precision medicine approaches to treat cancer. Although precision medicine offers promise to people with cancer and their families, that promise is only as good as our ability to make these treatments available to all patients. My presidential theme, ""Delivering Discoveries: Expanding the Reach of Precision Medicine,"" focuses on tackling this formidable challenge so that new targeted therapies are accessible to anyone who faces a cancer diagnosis. By improving access to high-quality care, harnessing big data on patient outcomes from across the globe, and pursuing innovative clinical trials, I am optimistic that we will speed the delivery of these most promising treatments to more patients.

Efficacy and safety analysis by age cohort of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in INO-VATE.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-01-30,"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in patients aged 18 to 78 years with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the INO-VATE trial. This subset analysis compared the efficacy and safety of InO in younger and older patients. Intent-to-treat analyses of morphologic responses and overall survival (OS) included 326 randomized patients, and safety assessments included 307 patients receiving 1 or more doses of the study treatment. Of the 326 patients, 164 received InO at a starting dose of 1.8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /cycle (0.8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 and 0.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 8 and 15 of a 21- to 28-day cycle [≤6 cycles]); 60 patients were aged ≥55 years, and 104 were aged <55 years. For older and younger patients, the median duration of InO therapy and the types and frequencies of adverse events of any grade were generally similar. Although the remission rates, median duration of remission (DOR), and progression-free survival were similar with InO for those aged <55 years and those aged ≥55 years, OS was longer for younger patients (median, 8.6 vs 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.610). Among patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after InO treatment (28% of older patients and 58% of younger patients), the incidence of veno-occlusive disease was greater in older patients (41% vs 17%). The study database was not locked at the time of this analysis. InO was tolerable in older patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Although OS was longer for younger patients versus older patients, InO demonstrated high response rates with similar DOR in the 2 age groups.

Long-Term Follow-up of CD19 CAR Therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2018-02-01,"CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells induce high rates of initial response among patients with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and long-term remissions in a subgroup of patients. We conducted a phase 1 trial involving adults with relapsed B-cell ALL who received an infusion of autologous T cells expressing the 19-28z CAR at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Safety and long-term outcomes were assessed, as were their associations with demographic, clinical, and disease characteristics. A total of 53 adults received 19-28z CAR T cells that were manufactured at MSKCC. After infusion, severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in 14 of 53 patients (26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15 to 40); 1 patient died. Complete remission was observed in 83% of the patients. At a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 1 to 65), the median event-free survival was 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 11.5), and the median overall survival was 12.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 23.4). Patients with a low disease burden (<5% bone marrow blasts) before treatment had markedly enhanced remission duration and survival, with a median event-free survival of 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.9 to not reached) and a median overall survival of 20.1 months (95% CI, 8.7 to not reached). Patients with a higher burden of disease (≥5% bone marrow blasts or extramedullary disease) had a greater incidence of the cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxic events and shorter long-term survival than did patients with a low disease burden. In the entire cohort, the median overall survival was 12.9 months. Among patients with a low disease burden, the median overall survival was 20.1 months and was accompanied by a markedly lower incidence of the cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxic events after 19-28z CAR T-cell infusion than was observed among patients with a higher disease burden.

Pegaspargase-related high-grade hepatotoxicity in a pediatric-inspired adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimen does not predict recurrent hepatotoxicity with subsequent doses.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2018-01-03,"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens, including higher cumulative asparaginase doses, have been investigated in adult ALL to improve outcomes. Preliminary results are promising, but hepatotoxicity rates with long-acting pegaspargase are greater in adults than children. However, adult pegaspargase-related hepatotoxicity is not as clearly defined despite being the commonest adult toxicity. We studied the frequency and characteristics of high-grade pegaspargase-related hepatotoxicity in newly diagnosed adults on a pediatric-inspired regimen that included six planned pegaspargase doses, 2000 IU/m<sup>2</sup>/dose intravenously, with doses given at least four weeks apart and not discontinued or dose-reduced for previous hepatotoxicity. Pegaspargase-related toxicity was monitored weekly after 185 delivered doses and reported by NCI CTCAE v3.0. Fifty-one patients, aged 18-57, received 192 pegaspargase doses (3.8 doses/patient).

Novel Therapies for Older Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2018-04-01,"Older adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have worse survival compared to their younger counterparts. Here, we review the reasons for the poorer outcomes of older patients with ALL and also summarize the current and future therapeutic approaches to ALL in the elderly population. The poor outcomes of older adults with ALL are driven largely by lack of tolerance to standard-dose chemotherapy, which leads to unacceptably high rates of myelosuppression-related deaths. Recent studies have shown promising results with the use of low-intensity or chemotherapy-free regimens in older patients with ALL, which are able to retain efficacy without excess toxicity. Novel antibody constructs such as inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab as well as potent later-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ponatinib hold significant promise in the management of ALL in the older adult.

<i>PDGFRB</i> mutation and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2018-02-06,"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises ∼10% to 15% of childhood ALL cases, many of which respond exquisitely to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), for example, imatinib in <i>PDGFRB</i>-rearranged ALL. However, some cases developed drug resistance to TKIs and the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel <i>PDGFRB</i> fusion gene, namely <i>AGGF1</i>-<i>PDGFRB</i>, and functionally characterized its oncogenic potential in vitro.

Secondary Philadelphia chromosome acquired during therapy of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2018-02-14,"The Philadelphia chromosome resulting from t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) or its variants is a defining event in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is also observed in several types of de novo acute leukemia, commonly in B lymphoblastic leukemia, and rarely in acute myeloid leukemia, acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage, and T lymphoblastic leukemia. Acquisition of the Philadelphia chromosome during therapy of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome is rare. We reported 19 patients, including 11 men and 8 women with a median age of 53 years at initial diagnosis. The diagnoses at initial presentation were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 11), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5), B lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2), and T lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1); no cases carried the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome was detected subsequently at relapse, or at refractory stage of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Of 14 patients evaluated for the BCR-ABL1 transcript subtype, 12 had the e1a2 transcript. In 11 of 14 patients, the diseases before and after emergence of the Philadelphia chromosome were clonally related by karyotype or shared gene mutations. Of 15 patients with treatment information available, 7 received chemotherapy alone, 5 received chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 2 received tyrosine kinase inhibitors only, and 1 patient was not treated. Twelve patients had follow-up after acquisition of the Philadelphia chromosome; all had persistent/refractory acute leukemia.

Pediatric-Inspired Treatment Regimens for Adolescents and Young Adults With Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Review.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-05-01,"The incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients (age range, 15-39 years) in the United States is increasing at a greater rate than in younger or older persons. Their optimal treatment has been increasingly debated as pediatric regimens have become more widely used in the age group. This review compares the basic features of pediatric and adult chemotherapy regimens for ALL and LBL, recognizes and describes the challenges of the pediatric regimen, and suggests strategies to facilitate its adoption for AYAs with ALL and LBL. All but 2 of 25 published comparisons of outcomes with pediatric and adult regimens for ALL and LBL in AYAs and 1 meta-analysis favor the pediatric regimen. After more than a half-century of clinical trials of the pediatric regimens, including at least 160 phase 3 trials in the United States, the pediatric regimens have become far more complex than most adult regimens. Asparaginase, a critical component of the pediatric regimens, is more difficult to administer to AYAs (and older patients) but nonetheless has a favorable benefit to toxicity ratio for AYAs. A dramatic reduction in outcome of ALL and LBL during the AYA years (the ""survival cliff"") is coincident with similar reductions in proportions of AYAs referred to academic centers and enrolled on clinical trials (the ""accrual cliff"" and ""referral cliff"").

Flow-cytometric vs. -morphologic assessment of remission in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group (COG).,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-02-23,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) after initial therapy is integral to risk stratification in B-precursor and T-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL, T-ALL). Although MRD determines depth of remission, remission remains defined by morphology. We determined the outcomes of children with discordant assessments of remission by morphology vs. flow cytometry using patients age 1-30.99 years enrolled on Children's Oncology Group ALL trials who underwent bone marrow assessment at the end of induction (N = 9350). Morphologic response was assessed locally as M1 (<5% lymphoblasts; remission), M2 (5-25%), or M3 (>25%). MRD was centrally measured by flow cytometry. Overall, 19.8% of patients with M2/M3 morphology had MRD < 5%. M1 with MRD ≥ 5% was less common in B-ALL (0.9%) than T-ALL (6.9%; p < 0.0001). In B-ALL, M1/MRD ≥ 5% was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS) than M2/MRD ≥ 5% (59.1% ± 6.5% vs. 39.1% ± 7.9%; p = 0.009), but was inferior to M1/MRD < 5% (87.1% ± 0.4%; p < 0.0001). MRD levels were higher in M2/MRD ≥ 5% than M1/MRD ≥ 5% patients. In T-ALL, EFS was not significantly different between M1/MRD ≥ 5% and M2/MRD ≥ 5%. Patients with morphologic remission but MRD ≥ 5% have outcomes similar to those who fail to achieve morphological remission, and significantly inferior to those with M1 marrows and concordant MRD, suggesting that flow cytometry should augment the definition of remission in ALL.",Comparative Study,697.0,7.0,Minimal residual disease MRD initial therapy integral risk stratification B-precursor T-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL T-ALL MRD determines depth remission remission remains defined morphology determined outcomes children discordant assessments remission morphology vs. flow cytometry patients age 1-30.99 years enrolled Children 's Oncology Group trials underwent bone marrow assessment end induction N 9350 Morphologic response assessed locally M1 5 lymphoblasts remission M2 5-25 M3 25 MRD centrally measured flow cytometry Overall 19.8 patients M2/M3 morphology MRD 5 M1 MRD ≥ 5 common B-ALL 0.9 T-ALL 6.9 p 0.0001 B-ALL M1/MRD ≥ 5 associated superior 5-year event-free survival EFS M2/MRD ≥ 5 59.1 ± 6.5 vs. 39.1 ± 7.9 p 0.009 inferior M1/MRD 5 87.1 ± 0.4 p 0.0001 MRD levels higher M2/MRD ≥ 5 M1/MRD ≥ 5 patients T-ALL EFS significantly different M1/MRD ≥ 5 M2/MRD ≥ 5 Patients morphologic remission MRD ≥ 5 outcomes similar fail achieve morphological remission significantly inferior M1 marrows concordant MRD suggesting flow cytometry augment definition remission,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1048, 753, 34, 2029, 50, 388, 36, 16, 4450, 6, 43, 1541, 4, 132, 2765, 2, 102, 2765, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 102, 62, 242, 2029, 9476, 2436, 1, 734, 734, 469, 395, 20, 2567, 21, 509, 3, 123, 1, 541, 5, 4570, 2182, 1, 734, 20, 2567, 105, 1412, 1914, 75, 7, 89, 14, 201, 1058, 60, 346, 23, 541, 292, 413, 87, 62, 143, 54, 208, 581, 455, 28, 3, 396, 1, 504, 78, 72241, 2815, 51, 10, 275, 795, 22, 4445, 33, 10521, 734, 821, 33, 243, 15, 9852, 243, 2029, 10, 4604, 644, 20, 1412, 1914, 63, 326, 66, 1, 7, 5, 821, 9852, 2567, 42, 2029, 33, 4445, 5, 2029, 749, 33, 10, 299, 186, 4, 132, 62, 13, 83, 76, 102, 62, 49, 83, 19, 13, 488, 4, 132, 62, 4445, 2029, 749, 33, 10, 41, 5, 1123, 33, 111, 774, 115, 25, 1683, 76, 821, 2029, 749, 33, 728, 14, 810, 49, 33, 105, 587, 14, 810, 67, 83, 19, 13, 2376, 84, 10, 1663, 6, 4445, 2029, 33, 912, 14, 810, 13, 39, 19, 13, 488, 2029, 148, 11, 142, 4, 821, 2029, 749, 33, 76, 4445, 2029, 749, 33, 7, 4, 102, 62, 1683, 10, 44, 97, 338, 59, 4445, 2029, 749, 33, 2, 821, 2029, 749, 33, 7, 5, 2815, 734, 84, 2029, 749, 33, 47, 123, 288, 6, 135, 54, 4373, 6, 1359, 4268, 734, 2, 97, 1663, 6, 135, 5, 4445, 13800, 2, 3610, 2029, 802, 17, 1412, 1914, 257, 4369, 3, 2470, 1, 734, 4, 62]",1346.0,29472723,Flow-cytometric vs. -morphologic assessment remission childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia report Children 's Oncology Group COG,1,0.001092896174863388
Cytokine Release Syndrome Grade as a Predictive Marker for Infections in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated With Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clin. Infect. Dis.,2018-08-01,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells that target the CD19 antigen present a novel promising therapy for the treatment of relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Although cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have emerged as predominant noninfectious complications of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, infections associated with this treatment modality have not been well documented. We analyzed infectious complications that followed CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in 53 adult patients with relapsed B-ALL enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NCT01044069). Overall, 22 patients (42%) experienced 26 infections (17 bacterial, 4 fungal, and 5 viral) within the first 30 days of CAR T-cell infusion. In 10 of 32 (31%) patients in whom complete remission was achieved, 15 infections developed between days 31 and 180; the majority of these late infections were due to respiratory viruses. In general, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were detected at a median of 18, 23, and 48 days, respectively, after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS grade 3 or higher was independently associated with increased risk of subsequent infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.67; P = .05) and in particular with bloodstream infection (adjusted HR, 19.97; P < .001). Three of 53 patients (6%) died of an infection-related cause. Infections in adult patients with relapsed B-ALL are common after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Understanding the infectious complications that are temporally coincident with CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is critical for developing effective prophylactic and other supportive care measures to improve clinical outcomes.

Evolution of neurocognitive function in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy only.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2018-02-27,"The purpose of this study was to determine the evolution of neurocognitive problems from therapy completion to long-term follow-up in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy only. We evaluated whether attention problems observed at therapy completion evolve into long-term executive dysfunction in 158 survivors treated on a single institution protocol. Treatment data (high-dose intravenous methotrexate exposure [serum concentration] and triple intrathecal chemotherapy injections) were collected. Parent report of behavior and direct cognitive testing of survivors was conducted at end of therapy, and survivors completed neurocognitive testing when > 5 years post-diagnosis. At the end of chemotherapy, survivors (52% female; mean age 9.2 years) demonstrated higher frequency of impairment in sustained attention (38%) and parent-reported inattention (20%) compared to population expectations (10%). At long-term follow-up, survivors (mean age 13.7 years; 7.6 years post-diagnosis) demonstrated higher impairment in executive function (flexibility 24%, fluency 21%), sustained attention (15%), and processing speed (15%). Sustained attention improved from end of therapy to long-term follow-up (p < 0.001). Higher methotrexate AUC and greater number of intrathecal injections were associated with attention problems (p = 0.009, p = 0.002, respectively) at the end of chemotherapy and executive function (p < 0.001, p = 0.02, respectively) problems at long-term follow-up. Attention problems at the end of therapy were not associated with executive function problems at long-term follow-up (p's > 0.05).

Dasatinib in Pediatric Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase: Results From a Phase II Trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-03-02,"Purpose Safe, effective treatments are needed for pediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Dasatinib is approved for treatment of adults and children with CML-CP. A phase I study determined suitable dosing for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized prospective trial of patients < 18 years of age receiving dasatinib. There are three cohorts: (1) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP, (2) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML in accelerated/blast phase or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 17), and (3) newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with tablets or powder for oral suspension. Major cytogenetic response > 30% for imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) > 55% for newly diagnosed patients were of clinical interest. Results Of 113 patients with CML-CP, 14 (48%) who were imatinib-resistant/intolerant and 61 (73%) who were newly diagnosed remained on treatment at time of analysis. Major cytogenetic response > 30% was reached by 3 months in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and CCyR > 55% was reached by 6 months in the newly diagnosed CML-CP group. CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months, respectively, were 76% and 41% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and 92% and 52% in newly diagnosed CML-CP group. Progression-free survival by 48 months was 78% and 93% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant and newly diagnosed CML-CP groups, respectively. No dasatinib-related pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported. Bone growth and development events were reported in 4% of patients. Conclusion In the largest prospective trial to date in children with CML-CP, we demonstrate that dasatinib is a safe, effective treatment of pediatric CML-CP. Target responses to first- or second-line dasatinib were met early, and deep molecular responses were observed. Safety of dasatinib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults; however, no cases of pleural or pericardial effusion or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",690.0,13.0,Purpose Safe effective treatments needed pediatric patients chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase CML-CP Dasatinib approved treatment adults children CML-CP phase determined suitable dosing children Philadelphia chromosome-positive Ph+ leukemias Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 phase II open-label nonrandomized prospective trial patients 18 years age receiving dasatinib cohorts 1 imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP 2 imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML accelerated/blast phase Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia n 17 3 newly diagnosed CML-CP treated tablets powder oral suspension Major cytogenetic response 30 imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients complete cytogenetic response CCyR 55 newly diagnosed patients clinical 113 patients CML-CP 14 48 imatinib-resistant/intolerant 61 73 newly diagnosed remained treatment time Major cytogenetic response 30 reached 3 months imatinib-resistant/intolerant group CCyR 55 reached 6 months newly diagnosed CML-CP group CCyR major molecular response 12 months respectively 76 41 imatinib-resistant/intolerant group 92 52 newly diagnosed CML-CP group Progression-free survival 48 months 78 93 imatinib-resistant/intolerant newly diagnosed CML-CP groups respectively dasatinib-related pleural pericardial effusion pulmonary edema pulmonary arterial hypertension reported Bone growth development events reported 4 patients largest prospective trial date children CML-CP demonstrate dasatinib safe effective treatment pediatric CML-CP Target responses first- second-line dasatinib met early deep molecular responses observed Safety dasatinib pediatric patients similar observed adults cases pleural pericardial effusion pulmonary arterial hypertension reported,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 1165, 323, 640, 32, 575, 9, 815, 7, 5, 442, 533, 4, 442, 124, 903, 2541, 1674, 16, 850, 9, 24, 1, 857, 2, 541, 5, 903, 2541, 8, 124, 70, 45, 509, 2884, 1280, 9, 541, 5, 3006, 1170, 109, 2058, 2792, 636, 31438, 7400, 72299, 16, 8, 124, 215, 1020, 1756, 5666, 482, 160, 1, 7, 203, 60, 1, 89, 357, 1674, 125, 32, 169, 736, 14, 577, 436, 4944, 903, 2541, 18, 577, 436, 4944, 903, 4, 2241, 3112, 124, 15, 2058, 286, 1275, 78, 269, 2, 27, 732, 265, 903, 2541, 73, 5, 6675, 15, 9984, 9, 518, 9348, 458, 1266, 51, 201, 9, 577, 436, 4944, 7, 2, 236, 1266, 51, 6412, 614, 9, 732, 265, 7, 11, 1, 38, 1333, 99, 1, 4259, 7, 5, 903, 2541, 213, 576, 54, 11, 577, 436, 4944, 2, 713, 803, 54, 11, 732, 265, 958, 23, 24, 28, 98, 1, 65, 458, 1266, 51, 201, 10, 1300, 20, 27, 53, 4, 3, 577, 436, 4944, 87, 2, 6412, 614, 10, 1300, 20, 49, 53, 4, 3, 732, 265, 903, 2541, 87, 6412, 2, 458, 219, 51, 20, 133, 53, 106, 11, 846, 2, 605, 4, 3, 577, 436, 4944, 87, 2, 937, 2, 653, 4, 732, 265, 903, 2541, 87, 91, 115, 25, 20, 576, 53, 10, 833, 2, 966, 4, 3, 577, 436, 4944, 2, 732, 265, 903, 2541, 271, 106, 77, 1674, 139, 2164, 15, 6657, 4433, 1087, 3306, 15, 1087, 3127, 1824, 11, 210, 129, 2, 193, 281, 11, 210, 4, 39, 1, 7, 1221, 4, 3, 2166, 482, 160, 6, 1244, 4, 541, 5, 903, 2541, 21, 608, 17, 1674, 16, 8, 1165, 323, 24, 1, 815, 903, 2541, 283, 253, 6, 157, 15, 419, 328, 1674, 11, 543, 191, 2, 2369, 219, 253, 11, 164, 367, 1, 1674, 4, 815, 7, 10, 288, 6, 17, 164, 4, 857, 137, 77, 140, 1, 2164, 15, 6657, 4433, 15, 1087, 3127, 1824, 11, 210]",2089.0,29498925,Dasatinib Pediatric Patients Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase Phase II Trial,12,0.013114754098360656
Prognostic impact of kinase-activating fusions and IKZF1 deletions in pediatric high-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-03-01,"Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements carry prognostic significance in pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Recent genome-wide analyses identified a high-risk B-ALL subtype characterized by a diverse spectrum of genetic alterations activating kinases and cytokine receptor genes. This subtype is associated with a poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy but has demonstrated sensitivity to the relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We sought to determine the frequency of kinase-activating fusions among National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk, Ph-negative, B-ALL patients enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 and to describe their associated clinical characteristics and outcomes. Among the 105 patients screened, 16 (15%) harbored an ABL-class fusion (<i>ETV6-ABL1</i>: n = 1; <i>FOXP1-ABL1</i>: n = 1; <i>SFPQ-ABL1</i>: n = 1; <i>ZC3HAV1-ABL2</i>: n = 1) or a fusion activating the JAK-STAT pathway (<i>P2RY8-CRLF2</i>: n = 8; <i>PAX5-JAK2</i>: n = 4). Sixty-nine percent of patients with an identified fusion had a concomitant <i>IKZF1</i> deletion (n = 11). In univariate analysis, fusion-positivity and <i>IKZF1</i> deletion were each associated with inferior event-free survival; <i>IKZF1</i> deletion retained statistical significance in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.64; <i>P</i> = .019).

Patient-reported outcomes from a phase 3 randomized controlled trial of inotuzumab ozogamicin versus standard therapy for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2018-03-06,"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), an anti-CD22 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate, demonstrated superior clinical activity versus standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapies for relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the phase 3 randomized controlled INO-VATE trial. The authors assessed patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from that study. Patients were randomized to receive either InO (1.8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per cycle for ≤6 cycles) or SOC (fludarabine/cytarabine [ara-C]/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, or ara-C plus mitoxantrone, or high-dose ara-C for ≤4 cycles) and completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire and the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Questionnaires at baseline, on day 1 of each cycle, and at the end of treatment. Treatment differences in PROs were assessed using longitudinal mixed-effects models with random intercepts and slopes. Questionnaire completion rates in the InO (n = 164) and SOC (n = 162) arms were 85% and 65%, respectively. Baseline scores were similar between arms. Patients who received InO reported better quality of life (QoL), functioning, and symptom scores (except for constipation and emotional functioning). Least-squares mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) differences in physical, role, and social functioning and in appetite loss were significant (6.9 [95% CI, 1.4-12.3], 11.4 [95% CI, 3.2-19.5], 8.4 [95% CI, 0.7-16.1], and -8.7 [95% CI, -16.0 to -1.4], respectively; all P < .05) and had exceeded the minimally important difference of 5. Mean treatment differences in favor of InO on the EuroQoL visual analog scale and the global health status/QoL, dyspnea, and fatigue scales reached or approached the minimally important difference of 5, although without statistical significance.

Gut Microbiome Composition Predicts Infection Risk During Chemotherapy in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,Clin. Infect. Dis.,2018-08-01,"Myelosuppression-related infections remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). By analyzing fecal samples collected at diagnosis and after each of the initial 3 phases of chemotherapy, we evaluated the role of gut microbiota in predicting infections in 199 children with newly diagnosed ALL. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was analyzed by high-depth sequencing to determine the diversity and composition of the microbiome. After the induction and reinduction I phases of chemotherapy, microbial diversity decreased significantly relative to the prechemotherapy value. After chemotherapy, the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa (eg, Bacteroidetes) decreased significantly, whereas that of other taxa (eg, Clostridiaceae and Streptococcaceae) increased. A baseline gut microbiome characterized by Proteobacteria predicted febrile neutropenia. Adjusting for the chemotherapy phase and ALL risk level, Enterococcaceae dominance (relative abundance ≥30%) predicted significantly greater risk of subsequent febrile neutropenia and diarrheal illness, whereas Streptococcaceae dominance predicted significantly greater risk of subsequent diarrheal illness. In children undergoing therapy for newly diagnosed ALL, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria before chemotherapy initiation predicts development of febrile neutropenia, and domination of the gut microbiota by Enterococcaceae or Streptococcaceae at any time during chemotherapy predicts infection in subsequent phases of chemotherapy.

Efficacy of Ponatinib Versus Earlier Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Front-line Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Philadelphia-positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2018-02-17,"Complete molecular response (CMR) and 2- and 3-year overall survival (OS) were compared for patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph<sup>+</sup> ALL) who had undergone front-line combination chemotherapy plus ponatinib versus combination therapy plus earlier generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib). We identified 26 Ph<sup>+</sup> ALL studies: 25 of earlier generation TKIs and 1 of ponatinib. The outcomes from studies of combination chemotherapy plus earlier generation TKIs were summarized using pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from a random-effects meta-analysis. A binomial distribution was assumed to calculate the 95% CIs for the results from the single-arm combination chemotherapy plus ponatinib trial. Adjusted logistic meta-regression analyses were used to compare the outcomes between the TKI groups. The percentage of patients achieving a CMR was greater with combination chemotherapy plus ponatinib (79%) than the pooled percentage of patients achieving a CMR with combination chemotherapy plus earlier generation TKIs (34%). Greater OS was observed with ponatinib compared with the pooled OS for earlier generation TKIs (2-year, 83% vs. 58%; 3-year, 79% vs. 50%). Odds ratios for ponatinib versus earlier generation TKIs were 6.09 (95% CI, 1.16-31.90; P = .034) for CMR, 3.70 (95% CI, 0.93-14.73; P = .062) for 2-year OS, and 4.49 (95% CI, 1.00-20.13; P = .050) for 3-year OS.

Behavioral symptoms and psychiatric disorders in child and adolescent long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy only.,Psycho-oncology,Psychooncology,2018-03-30,"Prevalence of emotional, behavioral, and psychiatric outcomes in child and adolescent survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a chemotherapy-only protocol were not well defined. Self- and parent-reported emotional and behavioral symptoms were assessed for 161 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (51.0% female; mean [SD] age 12.1[2.6] years; 7.5[1.6] years post-diagnosis). Age- and sex-adjusted scores were calculated for standardized measures and compared with 90th percentile of norms. Frequencies of survivor psychiatric disorders from structured diagnostic interviews with parents were compared with the general population. Parent emotional distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed. Associations between child symptoms/disorders and parent distress were examined with log-binomial models, adjusting for highest parent education. Compared with population expectations (10%), more survivors self-reported symptoms of inattention (27.9; 95% CI, 21.0%-35.7%), hyperactivity/impulsivity (26.0%; CI, 19.2%-33.6%), and oppositional-defiant behavior (20.1%; CI, 14.1%-27.3%). Parents reported survivors with more symptoms of inattention (23.6%; CI, 17.2%-31.0%), higher frequencies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (10.3% vs 2%) and oppositional defiant disorder (16.0% vs 9.5%), but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (7.1% vs 7.8%) or generalized anxiety disorder (3.2% vs 4.1%), compared with national norms.

Country-Level Macroeconomic Indicators Predict Early Post-Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Survival in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A CIBMTR Analysis.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-03-19,"For patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) offers a potential cure. Life-threatening complications can arise from alloHCT that require the application of sophisticated health care delivery. The impact of country-level economic conditions on post-transplantation outcomes is not known. Our objective was to assess whether these variables were associated with outcomes for patients transplanted for ALL. Using data from the Center for Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, we included 11,261 patients who received a first alloHCT for ALL from 303 centers across 38 countries between the years of 2005 and 2013. Cox regression models were constructed using the following macroeconomic indicators as main effects: Gross national income per capita, health expenditure per capita, and Human Development Index (HDI). The outcome was overall survival at 100 days following transplantation. In each model, transplants performed within lower resourced environments were associated with inferior overall survival. In the model with the HDI as the main effect, transplants performed in the lowest HDI quartile (n = 697) were associated with increased hazard for mortality (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.64 to 3.57; P < .001) in comparison with transplants performed in the countries with the highest HDI quartile. This translated into an 11% survival difference at 100 days (77% for lowest HDI quartile versus 88% for all other quartiles). Country-level macroeconomic indices were associated with lower survival at 100 days after alloHCT for ALL. The reasons for this disparity require further investigation.",Journal Article,673.0,1.0,"patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation alloHCT offers potential cure Life-threatening complications arise alloHCT require application sophisticated health care delivery impact country-level economic conditions post-transplantation outcomes known objective assess variables associated outcomes patients transplanted Center Blood Marrow Transplant Research included 11,261 patients received alloHCT 303 centers 38 countries years 2005 2013 Cox regression models constructed following macroeconomic indicators main effects Gross national income capita health expenditure capita Human Development Index HDI outcome overall survival 100 days following transplantation model transplants performed lower resourced environments associated inferior overall survival model HDI main effect transplants performed lowest HDI quartile n 697 associated increased hazard mortality hazard ratio 2.42 95 confidence interval 1.64 3.57 P .001 comparison transplants performed countries highest HDI quartile translated 11 survival difference 100 days 77 lowest HDI quartile versus 88 quartiles Country-level macroeconomic indices associated lower survival 100 days alloHCT reasons disparity require investigation",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 5514, 2339, 8, 174, 1722, 358, 3691, 521, 122, 3043, 29, 5514, 17, 1353, 3, 1581, 1, 8023, 341, 165, 989, 3, 345, 1, 5978, 301, 3875, 1298, 23, 539, 497, 123, 16, 44, 440, 114, 461, 10, 6, 423, 317, 46, 682, 11, 41, 5, 123, 9, 7, 4600, 9, 62, 75, 74, 29, 3, 574, 9, 315, 2, 581, 941, 389, 21, 159, 175, 7007, 7, 54, 103, 8, 157, 5514, 9, 62, 29, 9044, 1168, 716, 519, 2115, 59, 3, 60, 1, 1242, 2, 1346, 418, 320, 274, 11, 2776, 75, 3, 366, 38644, 3539, 22, 1895, 176, 1789, 657, 2306, 379, 17774, 341, 8699, 379, 17774, 2, 171, 193, 558, 6676, 3, 228, 10, 63, 25, 28, 394, 162, 366, 497, 4, 296, 202, 4016, 173, 262, 280, 41075, 10604, 11, 41, 5, 1663, 63, 25, 4, 3, 202, 5, 3, 6676, 22, 3, 1895, 254, 4016, 173, 4, 3, 2101, 6676, 3708, 78, 11989, 11, 41, 5, 101, 360, 9, 282, 360, 197, 18, 595, 48, 307, 268, 14, 660, 6, 27, 696, 19, 144, 4, 1155, 5, 4016, 173, 4, 3, 2115, 5, 3, 1076, 6676, 3708, 26, 5136, 237, 35, 175, 25, 523, 28, 394, 162, 849, 9, 2101, 6676, 3708, 185, 889, 9, 62, 127, 6028, 5978, 301, 38644, 3824, 11, 41, 5, 280, 25, 28, 394, 162, 50, 5514, 9, 62, 3, 2325, 9, 26, 4326, 1353, 195, 940]",1628.0,29567340,Country-Level Macroeconomic Indicators Predict Early Post-Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation Survival Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia CIBMTR,6,0.006557377049180328

Among 267 evaluable patients, 60%, 40%, and 24% achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and 4.5-log molecular response, respectively. The probability of maintaining MCyR for 5 years was 82% among responders. Dose reductions were implemented in October 2013 to decrease the risk of arterial occlusive events (AOEs); ≥90% of CP-CML patients who had achieved MCyR or MMR maintained response 40 months after elective dose reductions. Estimated 5-year overall survival was 73%. In CP-CML patients, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were rash (47%), abdominal pain (46%), thrombocytopenia (46%), headache (43%), dry skin (42%), and constipation (41%). The cumulative incidence of AOEs in CP-CML patients increased over time to 31%, while the exposure-adjusted incidence of new AOEs (15.8 and 4.9 per 100 patient-years in years 1 and 5, respectively) did not increase over time.

Association of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Central Nervous System Injury With Neurocognitive and Brain Imaging Outcomes in Children Receiving Chemotherapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-07-12,"Little is known about treatment-related neurotoxic mechanisms in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with chemotherapy only. To examine concentration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of brain injury at ALL diagnosis and during cancer therapy and to evaluate associations with long-term neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcomes and relevant genetic polymorphisms. This prospective cohort study included 235 patients with ALL who received a chemotherapy-only protocol. Patients provided CSF samples after diagnosis and throughout treatment. At 5 or more years after the diagnosis, 138 (69.7%) of 198 eligible survivors participated in long-term follow-up assessments. Children were treated from June 1, 2000, through October 31, 2010. Follow-up was completed on October 21, 2014, and data were analyzed from August 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016. Plasma concentration of high-dose intravenous methotrexate sodium and number of triple intrathecal chemotherapy injections. The CSF samples were assayed at 5 points from diagnosis to reinduction for biomarkers of myelin degradation (myelin basic protein [MBP]), neuronal damage (nerve growth factor [NGF] and total and phosphorylated tau protein), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuroinflammation (chitotriosidase). DNA was genotyped for polymorphisms in drug metabolism, oxidative stress, and neurodevelopment. Leukoencephalopathy was evaluated by brain imaging. At 5 or more years after the diagnosis, survivors completed neurocognitive testing and brain imaging of white matter integrity. Among the 235 patients with CSF samples (120 boys [51.1%] and 115 girls [48.9%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 6.8 [4.7] years), MBP and GFAP levels were elevated at baseline and through consolidation. The number of intrathecal injections was positively correlated with NGF level increase at consolidation (r = 0.19; P = .005). Increases in GFAP (risk ratio [RR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.40), MBP (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11), and total tau (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.78) levels were associated with a higher risk for leukoencephalopathy and higher apparent diffusion coefficient in frontal lobe white matter 5 years after diagnosis (standardized estimate, 0.05; P < .001).

Phase I trial of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-03-30,"We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10<sup>-3</sup> by polymerase chain reaction-based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",662.0,7.0,sought determine feasibility co-administering everolimus four-drug reinduction children adolescents acute lymphoblastic leukemia experiencing marrow relapse phase tested everolimus vincristine prednisone pegaspargase doxorubicin patients marrow relapse occurring 18 months complete remission CR primary aim identify maximum tolerated dose everolimus dose levels DLs tested dose escalation 2 3 5 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day Additional patients enrolled 3- 5 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day DLs evaluate toxicity dose expansion Thirteen patients enrolled dose escalation dose expansion dose escalation dose-limiting toxicity occurred grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia evaluable patients DL3 5 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day common grade ≥3 adverse events febrile neutropenia infections transaminitis hyperbilirubinemia hypophosphatemia 12 patients treated DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis Nineteen patients 86 achieved second CR CR2 13 68 low end-reinduction minimal residual disease MRD level ≤10 sup -3 /sup polymerase chain reaction-based CR2 rate patients B-cell treated DL3 n 12 92 82 patients low MRD Everolimus combined four-drug reinduction chemotherapy generally tolerated associated favorable rates CR2 low end-reinduction MRD recommended phase 2 dose everolimus given combination four-drug reinduction 5 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day promising combination evaluated larger patient cohort,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 990, 6, 223, 3, 1437, 1, 1269, 5776, 1400, 5, 8, 294, 234, 10177, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 2985, 8, 157, 581, 429, 26, 124, 70, 45, 650, 1400, 5, 2132, 1979, 12209, 2, 856, 4, 7, 5, 581, 429, 1821, 203, 53, 50, 157, 236, 734, 684, 3, 86, 1130, 10, 6, 255, 3, 689, 421, 61, 1, 1400, 169, 61, 148, 15038, 11, 650, 190, 61, 1125, 18, 27, 2, 33, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 402, 7, 11, 346, 28, 3, 27, 2, 33, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 15038, 6, 195, 376, 155, 61, 1422, 3170, 7, 346, 190, 61, 1125, 2, 762, 190, 61, 1422, 190, 61, 1125, 104, 61, 817, 155, 489, 88, 39, 7236, 4, 437, 859, 7, 28, 20544, 33, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 3, 96, 186, 88, 2608, 290, 281, 11, 2498, 778, 1875, 8181, 7236, 2, 8021, 100, 1, 3, 133, 7, 73, 28, 20544, 276, 72472, 72473, 10792, 3498, 7, 868, 513, 8, 419, 684, 7865, 1, 135, 233, 806, 42, 8, 154, 396, 10177, 1048, 753, 34, 2029, 301, 11209, 172, 27, 172, 20, 1451, 1260, 1329, 90, 719, 3, 7865, 116, 9, 7, 5, 132, 31, 62, 73, 28, 20544, 78, 133, 10, 937, 878, 1, 46, 7, 42, 154, 2029, 1400, 397, 5, 294, 234, 10177, 56, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 2, 41, 5, 913, 151, 1, 7865, 2, 154, 396, 10177, 2029, 3, 793, 124, 18, 61, 1, 1400, 447, 4, 150, 5, 8, 294, 234, 10177, 16, 33, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 26, 721, 150, 257, 40, 195, 194, 4, 8, 1077, 69, 180]",1725.0,29603593,Phase trial mTOR inhibitor everolimus combination multi-agent chemotherapy relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia,0,0.0
Exome chip analyses identify genes affecting mortality after HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2018-04-02,"Although survival outcomes have significantly improved, up to 40% of patients die within 1 year of HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). To identify non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after BMT, we performed the first exome-wide association study in the DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts using the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip. This study includes 2473 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome and 2221 10/10 HLA-matched donors treated from 2000 to 2011. Single-variant and gene-level analyses were performed on overall survival (OS), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), and disease-related mortality (DRM). Genotype mismatches between recipients and donors in a rare nonsynonymous variant of testis-expressed gene <i>TEX38</i> significantly increased risk of TRM, which was more dramatic when either the recipient or donor was female. Using the SKAT-O test to evaluate gene-level effects, variant genotypes of <i>OR51D1</i> in recipients were significantly associated with OS and TRM. In donors, 4 (<i>ALPP</i>, <i>EMID1</i>, <i>SLC44A5</i>, <i>LRP1</i>), 1 (<i>HHAT</i>), and 2 genes (<i>LYZL4</i>, <i>NT5E</i>) were significantly associated with OS, TRM, and DRM, respectively. Inspection of NT5E crystal structures showed 4 of the associated variants affected the enzyme structure and likely decreased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.

"""Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) State of the Art Updates and Next Questions""-Treatment of ALL.","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2018-04-03,"The outcome of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has substantially improved by adopting pediatric-inspired regimens, and approximately half of the patients are nowadays cured. The evaluation of minimal residual disease currently represents the most important prognostic indicator, which drives treatment algorithms, which include allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) allocation. Indeed, for high-risk patients, allo-SCT should be pursued as soon as possible, whereas in standard-risk patients this procedure should be avoided also in light of related toxicity and because there are no significant benefits. Furthermore, better characterization of the molecular genetic events can drive therapeutic decisions: a historical example in this respect is represented by the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL; in the upcoming future, TKIs might be used also in other subgroups, such as breakpoint cluster region/Abelson 1-like cases and others with deregulated tyrosine kinases.

Currently, no standardized therapy has been established, although an acute lymphoblastic leukemia type of treatment appears to be more effective in those patients who are able to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy. SL-401 is a targeted therapy directed to CD123, a protein ubiquitously expressed at high level on the surface of BPDCN blasts. In adult phase 2 trials, it has demonstrated efficacy with 90% overall response rate. No pediatric patients with BPDCN using SL-401 have been reported. Here, we report the first pediatric experience of three children with BPDCN treated with SL-401 at our institution. All patients tolerated SL-401 without significant toxicities.

Graft-versus-host disease in recipients of male unrelated donor compared with parous female sibling donor transplants.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-05-01,"Optimal donor selection is critical for successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Donor sex and parity are well-established risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with male donors typically associated with lower rates of GVHD. Well-matched unrelated donors (URDs) have also been associated with increased risks of GVHD as compared with matched sibling donors. These observations raise the question of whether male URDs would lead to more (or less) favorable transplant outcomes as compared with parous female sibling donors. We used the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry to complete a retrospective cohort study in adults with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent T-cell replete HCT from these 2 donor types (parous female sibling or male URD) between 2000 and 2012. Primary outcomes included grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse. In 2813 recipients, patients receiving male URD transplants (n = 1921) had 1.6 times higher risk of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD (<i>P</i> < .0001). For cGVHD, recipient sex was a significant factor, so donor/recipient pairs were evaluated. Female recipients of male URD grafts had a higher risk of cGVHD than those receiving parous female sibling grafts (relative risk [RR] = 1.43, <i>P</i> < .0001), whereas male recipients had similar rates of cGVHD regardless of donor type (RR = 1.09, <i>P</i> = .23).

Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults: current treatments and future perspectives.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2018-03-01,"Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately one-fourth of cases of adult ALL. It typically presents with an aggressive clinical course, responds poorly to standard chemotherapy, and carries a high risk for relapse. The landscape of Ph+ ALL therapy has changed favorably since the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). With the successful incorporation of TKIs into chemotherapy regimens, remissions occur more frequently and patients live longer. Imatinib was the first TKI that targeted the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein in Ph+ ALL. Since then, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib have been developed. Despite the significant progress that has been made in inducing remission, frequent relapses remain a challenge, especially among those with resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations. Still, the therapeutic armamentarium of ALL therapy is expanding at a breathtaking pace today compared with a decade ago. Novel drugs, such as potent later-generation TKIs, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, are being developed and investigated in patients with Ph+ ALL. In this review, we summarize the current treatment options for Ph+ ALL and highlight the therapies that may become the standard of care in the near future.",Journal Article,691.0,7.0,Philadelphia chromosome-positive Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts approximately one-fourth cases adult typically presents aggressive clinical course responds poorly standard chemotherapy carries high risk relapse landscape Ph+ therapy changed favorably development tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs successful incorporation TKIs chemotherapy regimens remissions occur frequently patients live longer Imatinib TKI targeted BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein Ph+ nilotinib dasatinib bosutinib ponatinib developed Despite significant progress inducing remission frequent relapses remain challenge especially resistant BCR-ABL1 therapeutic armamentarium therapy expanding breathtaking pace today compared decade ago Novel drugs potent later-generation TKIs antibody-drug conjugates bispecific monoclonal antibodies chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies developed investigated patients Ph+ review summarize current treatment options Ph+ highlight therapies standard care near future,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3006, 1170, 109, 2058, 286, 1275, 62, 4162, 9, 705, 104, 3608, 1, 140, 1, 780, 62, 192, 1969, 2740, 5, 35, 571, 38, 906, 7920, 1240, 6, 260, 56, 2, 4942, 8, 64, 43, 9, 429, 3, 2801, 1, 2058, 62, 36, 71, 2368, 5001, 1192, 3, 193, 1, 564, 216, 222, 1671, 5, 3, 1401, 2838, 1, 1671, 237, 56, 472, 3166, 1271, 80, 746, 2, 7, 3812, 589, 577, 10, 3, 157, 1379, 17, 238, 3, 1062, 3557, 6159, 4, 2058, 62, 1192, 818, 2638, 1674, 5936, 2, 5715, 47, 85, 276, 550, 3, 93, 1466, 17, 71, 85, 1229, 4, 1958, 734, 908, 3713, 918, 8, 1745, 1093, 107, 135, 5, 436, 1062, 3557, 138, 1234, 3, 189, 5543, 1, 62, 36, 16, 4304, 28, 8, 72732, 7265, 5665, 72, 5, 8, 2025, 5028, 229, 600, 225, 22, 1157, 1559, 914, 1671, 548, 234, 5968, 7408, 848, 890, 2, 2897, 448, 153, 102, 31, 235, 32, 486, 276, 2, 565, 4, 7, 5, 2058, 62, 4, 26, 206, 21, 2479, 3, 291, 24, 838, 9, 2058, 62, 2, 1817, 3, 235, 17, 68, 1417, 3, 260, 1, 165, 4, 3, 1829, 508]",1303.0,29742077,Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia adults current treatments future perspectives,114,0.12459016393442623

We examined the influence of family cohesion, parent distress, and overprotection on child symptom burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and family strain in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Parents of 213 children treated with chemotherapy only completed a survey when survivors were at least 5-year postdiagnosis. Family Environment Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Parent Protection Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, and Impact on Family were used to assess family cohesion, parental distress, overprotection, child symptom burden and HRQOL, and family strain, respectively.

The NOTCH1/CD44 axis drives pathogenesis in a T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia model.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2018-05-21,"NOTCH1 is a prevalent signaling pathway in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but crucial NOTCH1 downstream signals and target genes contributing to T-ALL pathogenesis cannot be retrospectively analyzed in patients and thus remain ill defined. This information is clinically relevant, as initiating lesions that lead to cell transformation and leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) activity are promising therapeutic targets against the major hurdle of T-ALL relapse. Here, we describe the generation in vivo of a human T cell leukemia that recapitulates T-ALL in patients, which arises de novo in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic progenitors ectopically expressing active NOTCH1. This T-ALL model allowed us to identify CD44 as a direct NOTCH1 transcriptional target and to recognize CD44 overexpression as an early hallmark of preleukemic cells that engraft the BM and finally develop a clonal transplantable T-ALL that infiltrates lymphoid organs and brain. Notably, CD44 is shown to support crucial BM niche interactions necessary for LIC activity of human T-ALL xenografts and disease progression, highlighting the importance of the NOTCH1/CD44 axis in T-ALL pathogenesis.

Related donor transplants: has posttransplantation cyclophosphamide nullified the detrimental effect of HLA mismatch?,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-06-01,"We sought to identify whether posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) reduces or eliminates the detrimental impact of HLA mismatching on outcomes of HLA-haploidentical related donor transplantation for acute leukemia. Data from 2143 donor-recipient pairs (n = 218 haploidentical sibling; n = 218 offspring; n = 1707 HLA-matched sibling) with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia were studied. All received a calcineurin inhibitor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis while high-dose PT-Cy was also given to recipients of haploidentical transplant. Patient age correlated with donor-recipient relationship: haploidentical siblings donated to patients aged 18 to 54 years whereas offspring donated to patients aged 55 to 76 years. Therefore, transplant outcomes were examined separately in the 2 patient age groups. In patients aged 18 to 54 years, there were no significant differences in outcomes except chronic GVHD, which was lower after haploidentical sibling compared to HLA-matched sibling transplant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; <i>P</i> < .001). In patients aged 55 to 76 years, despite lower chronic GVHD (HR, 0.42; <i>P</i> < .001), graft failure (14% vs 6%; <i>P</i> = .003), nonrelapse mortality (HR, 1.48; <i>P</i> = .02), and overall mortality (HR, 1.32; <i>P</i> = .003) were higher after transplant from offspring compared with an HLA-matched sibling. These data demonstrate a superior outcome in older recipients when using an HLA-matched sibling instead of offspring, although there were differences in transplant platforms (GVHD prophylaxis and graft type) between the 2 groups.

Clin. Oncol.,2018-05-29,"Purpose Addition of imatinib to intensive chemotherapy improved survival for children and young adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Compared with imatinib, dasatinib has increased potency, CNS penetration, and activity against imatinib-resistant clones. Patients and Methods Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial AALL0622 (Bristol Myers Squibb trial CA180-204) tested safety and feasibility of adding dasatinib to intensive chemotherapy starting at induction day 15 in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia age 1 to 30 years. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) was recommended for patients at high risk based on slow response and for those with a matched family donor regardless of response after at least 11 weeks of therapy. Patients at standard risk based on rapid response received chemotherapy plus dasatinib for an additional 120 weeks. Patients with overt CNS leukemia received cranial irradiation. Results Sixty eligible patients were enrolled. Five-year overall (OS) and event-free survival rates (± standard deviations [SD]) were 86% ± 5% and 60% ± 7% overall, 87% ± 5% and 61% ± 7% for standard-risk patients (n = 48; 19% underwent HSCT), and 89% ± 13% and 67% ± 19% for high-risk patients (n = 9; 89% underwent HSCT), respectively. Five-year cumulative incidence (± SD) of CNS relapse was 15% ± 6%. Outcomes (± SDs) were similar to those in COG AALL0031, which used the same chemotherapy with continuous imatinib: 5-year OS of 81% ± 6% versus 86% ± 5% ( P = .63) and 5-year disease-free survival of 68% ± 7% versus 60% ± 7% ( P = 0.31) for AALL0031 versus AALL0622, respectively. IKZF1 deletions, present in 56% of tested patients, were associated with significantly inferior OS and event-free survival overall and in standard-risk patients. Conclusion Dasatinib was well tolerated with chemotherapy and provided outcomes similar to those with imatinib in COG AALL0031, where all patients received cranial irradiation.

Clin. Oncol.,2018-05-29,"Purpose To compare peripheral nervous system function and balance between adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and matched controls and to determine associations between peripheral neuropathy (PN) and limitations in static balance, mobility, walking endurance, and quality of life (QoL) among survivors. Patients and Methods Three hundred sixty-five adult survivors of childhood ALL and 365 controls with no cancer history completed assessments of PN (modified Total Neuropathy Score [mTNS]), static balance (Sensory Organization Test [SOT]), mobility (Timed Up and Go), walking endurance (6-minute walk test), QoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Survey), and visual-motor processing speed (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). Results PN, but not impairments, in performance on SOT was more common in survivors than controls (41.4% v 9.5%, respectively; P < .001). In multivariable models, higher mTNS scores were associated with longer time to complete the Timed Up and Go (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23; P < .001), shorter distance walked in 6 minutes (β = -4.39; 95% CI, -8.63 to -0.14; P = .04), and reduced QoL (β = -1.33; 95% CI, -1.79 to -0.87; P < .001 for physical functioning; β = -1.16; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.67; P < .001 for role physical; and β = -0.88; 95% CI, -1.34 to -0.42; P < .001 for general health). Processing speed (β = 1.69; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.40; P < .001), but not mTNS score, was associated with anterior-posterior sway on the SOT. Conclusion PN in long-term ALL survivors is associated with movement, including mobility and walking endurance, but not with static standing balance. The association between processing speed and sway suggests that static balance impairment in ALL survivors may be influenced by problems with CNS function, including the processing of sensory information.",Journal Article,602.0,2.0,Purpose compare peripheral nervous function balance adult survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia matched controls determine associations peripheral neuropathy PN limitations static balance mobility walking endurance quality life QoL survivors Patients Methods sixty-five adult survivors childhood 365 controls history completed assessments PN modified Total Neuropathy Score mTNS static balance Sensory Organization Test SOT mobility Timed walking endurance 6-minute walk test QoL Medical Outcomes 36-Item Short Form Survey visual-motor processing speed Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale PN impairments performance SOT common survivors controls 41.4 v 9.5 respectively P .001 multivariable models higher mTNS scores associated longer time complete Timed 0.15 95 CI 0.06 0.23 P .001 shorter distance walked 6 minutes -4.39 95 CI -8.63 -0.14 P .04 reduced QoL -1.33 95 CI -1.79 -0.87 P .001 physical functioning -1.16 95 CI -1.64 -0.67 P .001 role physical -0.88 95 CI -1.34 -0.42 P .001 general health Processing speed 1.69 95 CI 0.98 2.40 P .001 mTNS score associated anterior-posterior sway SOT PN long-term survivors associated movement including mobility walking endurance static standing balance association processing speed sway suggests static balance impairment survivors influenced problems CNS function including processing sensory information,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 6, 932, 672, 1880, 398, 343, 2, 3459, 59, 780, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 2, 655, 535, 2, 6, 223, 685, 59, 672, 1751, 2700, 2, 1939, 4, 9708, 3459, 5717, 7467, 15794, 2, 372, 1, 358, 1001, 107, 332, 7, 2, 636, 169, 1128, 1746, 365, 780, 332, 1, 864, 62, 2, 7405, 535, 5, 77, 12, 532, 781, 2182, 1, 2700, 1230, 181, 1751, 368, 32888, 9708, 3459, 4148, 2533, 412, 22580, 5717, 12200, 126, 2, 3537, 7467, 15794, 49, 3949, 8200, 412, 1001, 484, 123, 45, 511, 3471, 978, 1297, 1407, 2, 3046, 3482, 3325, 5051, 17526, 780, 9125, 1124, 99, 2700, 84, 44, 6948, 4, 528, 23, 22580, 10, 80, 186, 4, 332, 76, 535, 605, 39, 603, 83, 33, 106, 19, 144, 4, 658, 274, 142, 32888, 703, 11, 41, 5, 589, 98, 6, 236, 3, 12200, 126, 2, 3537, 13, 167, 48, 58, 13, 1460, 6, 13, 382, 19, 144, 985, 3019, 23291, 4, 49, 2511, 39, 587, 48, 58, 66, 676, 6, 13, 213, 19, 755, 2, 405, 1001, 14, 466, 48, 58, 14, 842, 6, 13, 912, 19, 144, 9, 900, 2702, 14, 245, 48, 58, 14, 660, 6, 13, 598, 19, 144, 9, 200, 900, 2, 13, 889, 48, 58, 14, 562, 6, 13, 595, 19, 144, 9, 1083, 341, 3325, 5051, 14, 790, 48, 58, 13, 1096, 6, 18, 327, 19, 144, 84, 44, 32888, 368, 10, 41, 5, 2882, 3028, 51087, 23, 3, 22580, 1221, 2700, 4, 319, 337, 62, 332, 16, 41, 5, 7950, 141, 5717, 2, 7467, 15794, 84, 44, 5, 9708, 10909, 3459, 3, 248, 59, 3325, 5051, 2, 51087, 844, 17, 9708, 3459, 2315, 4, 62, 332, 68, 40, 2574, 20, 2408, 5, 1025, 343, 141, 3, 3325, 1, 4148, 487]",1715.0,29812998,Peripheral Neuropathy Sensory Processing Balance Survivors Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10,0.01092896174863388
SOHO State of the Art Update and Next Questions: Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2018-05-22,"The widespread adoption of Bcr-Abl-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into first-line regimens for patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has revolutionized the outcomes of patients with this disease. Whereas Ph<sup>+</sup> ALL was historically associated with cure rates of <25% in the pre-TKI era, now long-term survival in more than 75% of patients has been reported.

Outcome of children and adolescents with Down syndrome treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Consortium protocols 00-001 and 05-001.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-06-07,"Children and adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are reported to have increased relapse rates and therapy-related mortality (TRM). Treatment regimens for DS-ALL patients often include therapy modifications. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium protocols have used same risk-stratified treatment for patients with and without DS. We compared clinical and outcome data of DS (n = 38) and non-DS (n = 1,248) patients enrolled on two consecutive DFCI ALL trials 00-001 (2000-2004) and 05-001 (2005-2011) with similar risk adapted therapy regardless of DS status. There was no difference in demographic or presenting clinical features between two groups except absence of T-cell phenotype and lower frequency of hyperdiploidy in DS-ALL group. All DS-ALL patients achieved complete remission; four relapsed and one subsequently died. There was no TRM in DS-ALL patients. DS-ALL patients had significantly higher rates of mucositis (52% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), non-CNS thrombosis (18% vs. 8%; p = 0.036), and seizure (16% vs. 5%, p = 0.010). Compared to non-DS-ALL patients, DS-ALL patients had a higher incidence of infections during all therapy phases. The 5-year event-free and overall survival rates of DS-ALL patients were similar to non-DS-ALL patients (91% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81-100] vs. 84% [95% CI, 82-86]; 97% [95% CI, 92-100] vs. 91% [95% CI, 90-93]). The low rates of relapse and TRM indicate that uniform risk-stratified therapy for DS-ALL and non-DS-ALL patients on DFCI ALL Consortium protocols was safe and effective, although the increased rate of toxicity in the DS-ALL patients highlights the importance of supportive care during therapy.",Clinical Trial,593.0,5.0,"Children adolescents syndrome DS acute lymphoblastic leukemia reported increased relapse rates therapy-related mortality TRM Treatment regimens DS-ALL patients include therapy modifications Dana-Farber Institute DFCI Consortium protocols risk-stratified treatment patients DS compared clinical outcome DS n 38 non-DS n 1,248 patients enrolled consecutive DFCI trials 00-001 2000-2004 05-001 2005-2011 similar risk adapted therapy regardless DS status difference demographic presenting clinical features groups absence T-cell phenotype lower frequency hyperdiploidy DS-ALL group DS-ALL patients achieved complete remission relapsed subsequently died TRM DS-ALL patients DS-ALL patients significantly higher rates mucositis 52 vs. 12 p 0.001 non-CNS thrombosis 18 vs. 8 p 0.036 seizure 16 vs. 5 p 0.010 Compared non-DS-ALL patients DS-ALL patients higher incidence infections therapy phases 5-year event-free overall survival rates DS-ALL patients similar non-DS-ALL patients 91 95 confidence interval CI 81-100 vs. 84 95 CI 82-86 97 95 CI 92-100 vs. 91 95 CI 90-93 low rates relapse TRM indicate uniform risk-stratified therapy DS-ALL non-DS-ALL patients DFCI Consortium protocols safe effective increased rate toxicity DS-ALL patients highlights importance supportive care therapy",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[541, 2, 3101, 5, 1328, 681, 3602, 2, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 210, 6, 47, 101, 429, 151, 2, 36, 139, 282, 5064, 24, 472, 9, 3602, 62, 7, 629, 643, 36, 2916, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 11152, 62, 2404, 2189, 47, 95, 827, 43, 1173, 24, 9, 7, 5, 2, 187, 3602, 21, 72, 38, 2, 228, 74, 1, 3602, 78, 519, 2, 220, 3602, 78, 14, 7100, 7, 346, 23, 100, 935, 11152, 62, 143, 2038, 144, 1081, 1131, 2, 474, 144, 1242, 1132, 5, 288, 43, 3716, 36, 1583, 1, 3602, 156, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 1540, 15, 1656, 38, 404, 59, 100, 271, 2187, 1127, 1, 102, 31, 1005, 2, 280, 675, 1, 11299, 4, 3602, 62, 87, 62, 3602, 62, 7, 513, 236, 734, 294, 591, 2, 104, 1611, 1016, 125, 10, 77, 5064, 4, 3602, 62, 7, 3602, 62, 7, 42, 97, 142, 151, 1, 2606, 653, 105, 133, 19, 13, 144, 220, 1025, 2839, 203, 105, 66, 19, 13, 5395, 2, 5866, 245, 105, 33, 19, 13, 4873, 72, 6, 220, 3602, 62, 7, 3602, 62, 7, 42, 8, 142, 287, 1, 1875, 190, 62, 36, 3523, 3, 33, 111, 774, 115, 2, 63, 25, 151, 1, 3602, 62, 7, 11, 288, 6, 220, 3602, 62, 7, 970, 48, 307, 268, 58, 865, 394, 105, 874, 48, 58, 878, 868, 1015, 48, 58, 937, 394, 105, 970, 48, 58, 424, 966, 3, 154, 151, 1, 429, 2, 5064, 1008, 17, 3490, 43, 1173, 36, 9, 3602, 62, 2, 220, 3602, 62, 7, 23, 11152, 62, 2404, 2189, 10, 1165, 2, 323, 242, 3, 101, 116, 1, 155, 4, 3, 3602, 62, 7, 2527, 3, 1187, 1, 1877, 165, 190, 36]",1621.0,29878490,Outcome children adolescents syndrome treated Dana-Farber Institute Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Consortium protocols 00-001 05-001,25,0.0273224043715847
Clinical and Biological Correlates of Neurotoxicity Associated with CAR T-cell Therapy in Patients with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2018-06-07,"CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is highly effective against relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but is hindered by neurotoxicity. In 53 adult patients with ALL, we found a significant association of severe neurotoxicity with high pretreatment disease burden, higher peak CAR T-cell expansion, and early and higher elevations of proinflammatory cytokines in blood. Patients with severe neurotoxicity had evidence of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier disruption correlating with neurotoxicity grade without association with CSF white blood cell count or CAR T-cell quantity in CSF. Proinflammatory cytokines were enriched in CSF during severe neurotoxicity with disproportionately high levels of IL6, IL8, MCP1, and IP10, suggesting central nervous system-specific production. Seizures, seizure-like activity, myoclonus, and neuroimaging characteristics suggested excitatory neurotoxicity, and we found elevated levels of endogenous excitatory agonists in CSF during neurotoxicity.<b>Significance:</b> We detail the neurologic symptoms and blood, CSF, and neuroimaging correlates of neurotoxicity associated with CD19 CAR T cells and identify neurotoxicity risk factors.

"Therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia has distinct clinical and cytogenetic features compared to <i>de novo</i> acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but outcomes are comparable in transplanted patients.",Haematologica,Haematologica,2018-06-14,"Therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains poorly defined due to a lack of large data sets recognizing the defining characteristics of this entity. We reviewed all consecutive cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our institution between 2000 and 2017 and identified therapy-related cases - defined as acute lymphoblastic leukemia preceded by prior exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation. Of 1022 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 93 (9.1%) were classified as therapy-related. The median latency for therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia onset was 6.8 years from original diagnosis, and this was shorter for patients carrying the <i>MLL</i> gene rearrangement compared to those with other cytogenetics. When compared to <i>de novo</i> acute lymphoblastic leukemia, therapy-related patients were older (<i>P</i><0.01), more often female (<i>P</i><0.01), and had more <i>MLL</i> gene rearrangement (<i>P</i><0.0001) and chromosomes 5/7 aberrations (<i>P</i>=0.02). Although therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with inferior 2-year overall survival compared to <i>de novo</i> cases (46.0% <i>vs</i> 68.1%, <i>P</i>=0.001), prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy (therapy-related) did not independently impact survival in multivariate analysis (HR=1.32; 95% CI: 0.97-1.80, <i>P</i>=0.08).

Autologous CD19-Targeted CAR T Cells in Patients with Residual CLL following Initial Purine Analog-Based Therapy.,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,Mol. Ther.,2018-06-15,"Patients with residual chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) following initial purine analog-based chemoimmunotherapy exhibit a shorter duration of response and may benefit from novel therapeutic strategies. We and others have previously described the safety and efficacy of autologous T cells modified to express anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and CLL. Here we report the use of CD19-targeted CAR T cells incorporating the intracellular signaling domain of CD28 (19-28z) as a consolidative therapy in 8 patients with residual CLL following first-line chemoimmunotherapy with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Outpatients received low-dose conditioning therapy with cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), followed by escalating doses of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>, or 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> 19-28z CAR T cells/kg. An objective response was observed in 3 of 8 patients (38%), with a clinically complete response lasting more than 28 months observed in two patients.

Oncogenic TRK fusions are amenable to inhibition in hematologic malignancies.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2018-08-06,"Rearrangements involving the neurotrophic receptor kinase genes (NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3; hereafter referred to as TRK) produce oncogenic fusions in a wide variety of cancers in adults and children. Although TRK fusions occur in fewer than 1% of all solid tumors, inhibition of TRK results in profound therapeutic responses, resulting in Breakthrough Therapy FDA approval of the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors, regardless of histology. In contrast to solid tumors, the frequency of TRK fusions and the clinical effects of targeting TRK in hematologic malignancies are unknown. Here, through an evaluation for TRK fusions across more than 7,000 patients with hematologic malignancies, we identified TRK fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), histiocytosis, multiple myeloma, and dendritic cell neoplasms. Although TRK fusions occurred in only 0.1% of patients (8 of 7,311 patients), they conferred responsiveness to TRK inhibition in vitro and in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft and a corresponding AML patient with ETV6-NTRK2 fusion. These data identify that despite their individual rarity, collectively, TRK fusions are present in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies and predict clinically significant therapeutic responses to TRK inhibition.",Case Reports,533.0,10.0,"Rearrangements involving neurotrophic receptor kinase NTRK1 NTRK2 NTRK3 referred TRK produce oncogenic fusions wide variety adults children TRK fusions occur fewer 1 solid inhibition TRK profound therapeutic responses resulting Breakthrough Therapy FDA approval TRK inhibitor larotrectinib adult pediatric patients solid regardless histology contrast solid frequency TRK fusions clinical effects targeting TRK hematologic malignancies unknown evaluation TRK fusions 7,000 patients hematologic malignancies identified TRK fusions acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia AML histiocytosis multiple myeloma dendritic neoplasms TRK fusions occurred 0.1 patients 8 7,311 patients conferred responsiveness TRK inhibition vitro vivo patient-derived xenograft corresponding AML patient ETV6-NTRK2 fusion identify despite individual rarity collectively TRK fusions present wide variety hematologic malignancies predict clinically significant therapeutic responses TRK inhibition",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2072, 1267, 3, 12967, 153, 216, 214, 11220, 16151, 2, 11004, 12394, 1995, 6, 22, 6393, 2410, 1302, 2530, 4, 8, 1019, 1362, 1, 163, 4, 857, 2, 541, 242, 6393, 2530, 1271, 4, 1497, 76, 14, 1, 62, 537, 57, 297, 1, 6393, 99, 4, 4399, 189, 253, 1113, 4, 6022, 36, 2078, 1814, 1, 3, 6393, 230, 13463, 9, 780, 2, 815, 7, 5, 537, 57, 1583, 1, 784, 4, 748, 6, 537, 57, 3, 675, 1, 6393, 2530, 2, 3, 38, 176, 1, 529, 6393, 4, 813, 441, 32, 860, 467, 298, 35, 451, 9, 6393, 2530, 716, 80, 76, 67, 984, 7, 5, 813, 441, 21, 108, 6393, 2530, 4, 286, 1275, 62, 286, 533, 329, 13976, 232, 2, 2464, 31, 1179, 242, 6393, 2530, 489, 4, 158, 13, 14, 1, 7, 66, 1, 67, 9521, 7, 491, 3851, 3642, 6, 6393, 297, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 4, 8, 69, 526, 1330, 2, 8, 1734, 329, 69, 5, 7306, 16151, 1212, 46, 74, 255, 17, 550, 136, 797, 4989, 2535, 6393, 2530, 32, 364, 4, 8, 1019, 1362, 1, 813, 441, 2, 678, 505, 93, 189, 253, 6, 6393, 297]",1283.0,29920189,Oncogenic TRK fusions amenable inhibition hematologic malignancies,6,0.006557377049180328

We used the search terms ""acute lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemia"" or ""ALL."" We largely selected publications in the past 5 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. Target therapies toward specific transcripts (eg, BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase oncoprotein by tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and specific leukemic cell surface antigens (eg, CD20, CD22, and CD19 monoclonal antibodies) are major breakthroughs. Current treatments produce long-term survival in 50% of patients with precursor B-cell ALL including 50% to 70% with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL, 50% to 60% with T-cell ALL, and 80% with mature B-cell ALL. Next-generation sequencing and genomic profiling in ALL have identified new prognostic markers, targets, and ALL subtypes (eg, Ph-like ALL). Monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibody constructs, and chimeric antigen receptor T cellular therapies developed in the past 5 to 7 years have revolutionized the treatment of ALL and resulted in US Food and Drug Administration approvals of blinatumomab in 2014, as well as inotuzumab and tisagenlecleucel in 2017 as ALL salvage strategies. Their use in combined modalities as salvage and frontline therapies is currently under investigation. Therapies targeting specific transcripts or leukemic cell surface antigens are major breakthroughs in the treatment of adults with ALL.

Brain Network Connectivity and Executive Function in Long-Term Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,Brain connectivity,Brain Connect,2018-08-01,"Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common cancer affecting young children, have been associated with long-term cognitive impairments that reduce quality of life. Executive dysfunction is one of the most consistently observed deficits and can have substantial and pervasive effects on academic success, occupational achievement, psychosocial function, and psychiatric status. We examined the neural mechanisms of executive dysfunction by measuring structural and functional connectomes in 161 long-term survivors of pediatric ALL, age 8-21 years, who were treated on a single contemporary chemotherapy-only protocol for standard/high- or low-risk disease. Lower global efficiency, a measure of information exchange and network integration, of both structural and functional connectomes was found in survivors with executive dysfunction compared with those without dysfunction (p < 0.046). Patients with standard/high- versus low-risk disease and those who received greater number of intrathecal treatments containing methotrexate had the lowest network efficiencies. Patients with executive dysfunction also showed hyperconnectivity in sensorimotor, visual, and auditory-processing regions (p = 0.037) and poor separation between sensorimotor, executive/attention, salience, and default mode networks (p < 0.0001). Connectome disruption was consistent with a pattern of delayed neurodevelopment that may be associated with reduced resilience, adaptability, and flexibility of the brain network.

Refining risk classification in childhood B acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-06-01,"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 tested a new risk stratification system in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At study entry, B-ALL patients were classified as standard risk (SR) or high risk (HR) based on age, white blood cell (WBC) count, and central nervous system status. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients with high end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) (≥10<sup>-3</sup> by polymerase chain reaction analysis of patient-specific antigen receptor rearrangements) and/or adverse cytogenetics (<i>KMT2A</i> rearrangement or hypodiploidy) were reclassified as very high risk (VHR) and received intensified therapy. <i>IKZF1</i> deletion status was retrospectively evaluated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Between 2005 and 2011, 678 Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL patients aged 1 to 18 years enrolled; 651 achieved CR and 648 received a final risk group. Among all 678 patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84-89) and overall survival 93% (95% CI, 90-94). Five-year disease-free survival of SR patients (N = 407) was 94% (95% CI, 91-96), HR (N = 176) was 84% (95% CI, 77-88), and VHR (N = 65) was 79% (95% CI, 67-87). <i>IKZF1</i> deletion was present in 62 of 385 (16%) assessed patients and was associated with inferior 5-year EFS (63%; 95% CI, 49%-74% vs 88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; <i>P</i> < .001), and higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, including among those with low MRD (24% vs 8%, <i>P</i> = .001).

Exposure-adjusted adverse events comparing blinatumomab with chemotherapy in advanced acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-07-01,"In the phase 3 TOWER study, blinatumomab demonstrated an overall survival benefit over standard-of-care chemotherapy (SOC) in adults with relapsed or refractory (r/r) Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph<sup>-</sup>) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Nearly all patients in both treatment arms experienced an adverse event (AE), and the incidence rate of serious AEs was higher for blinatumomab. However, as treatment exposure differed between the 2 arms, we conducted an exploratory safety analysis comparing exposure-adjusted event rates (EAERs) of blinatumomab vs SOC. Analyses were conducted for all patients who received therapy (safety population). Patients received a median (range) of 2 cycles (1-9) of blinatumomab (N = 267) vs 1 cycle (1-4) of SOC (N = 109). Grade ≥3 AE rates were generally higher in cycle 1 of blinatumomab than in cycle 2 (76% vs 37%). After adjusting for time on treatment, EAERs of grade ≥3 were significantly lower for blinatumomab vs SOC overall (10.73 vs 45.27 events per patient-year; <i>P</i> < .001) and for events of clinical interest, including infections (1.63 vs 6.49 events per patient-year; <i>P</i> < .001), cytopenias (3.64 vs 20.07 events per patient-year; <i>P</i> < .001), and neurologic events (0.38 vs 0.95 events per patient-year; <i>P</i> = .008). The EAER of grade ≥3 cytokine-release syndrome was higher for blinatumomab than for SOC (0.16 vs 0 events per patient-year; <i>P</i> = .038). These data further support the role of blinatumomab as an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with r/r Ph<sup>-</sup> ALL.

Integrative genomic analysis of adult mixed phenotype acute leukemia delineates lineage associated molecular subtypes.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2018-07-10,"Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare subtype of acute leukemia characterized by leukemic blasts presenting myeloid and lymphoid markers. Here we report data from integrated genomic analysis on 31 MPAL samples and compare molecular profiling with that from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Consistent with the mixed immunophenotype, both AML-type and ALL-type mutations are detected in MPAL. Myeloid-B and myeloid-T MPAL show distinct mutation and methylation signatures that are associated with differences in lineage-commitment gene expressions. Genome-wide methylation comparison among MPAL, AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL sub-classifies MPAL into AML-type and ALL-type MPAL, which is associated with better clinical response when lineage-matched therapy is given. These results elucidate the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of MPAL and its genetic distinction from AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL and further provide proof of concept for a molecularly guided precision therapy approach in MPAL.",Journal Article,560.0,9.0,Mixed phenotype acute leukemia MPAL rare subtype acute leukemia characterized leukemic blasts presenting myeloid lymphoid markers report integrated genomic 31 MPAL compare molecular profiling acute myeloid leukemia AML B acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-ALL Consistent mixed immunophenotype AML-type ALL-type detected MPAL Myeloid-B myeloid-T MPAL distinct methylation signatures associated differences lineage-commitment expressions Genome-wide methylation comparison MPAL AML B-ALL T-ALL sub-classifies MPAL AML-type ALL-type MPAL associated better clinical response lineage-matched therapy given elucidate genetic epigenetic heterogeneity MPAL genetic distinction AML B-ALL T-ALL provide proof concept molecularly guided precision therapy approach MPAL,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1739, 1005, 286, 9407, 16, 8, 622, 875, 1, 286, 765, 20, 2015, 2438, 1656, 533, 2, 2303, 525, 467, 21, 414, 74, 29, 2102, 572, 65, 23, 456, 9407, 347, 2, 932, 219, 1080, 5, 17, 29, 286, 533, 329, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 132, 62, 2, 102, 31, 286, 1275, 102, 62, 925, 5, 3, 1739, 5496, 110, 329, 267, 2, 62, 267, 138, 32, 530, 4, 9407, 533, 132, 2, 533, 102, 9407, 514, 834, 258, 2, 569, 2210, 17, 32, 41, 5, 362, 4, 2542, 11082, 145, 4249, 898, 1019, 569, 1155, 107, 9407, 329, 132, 62, 2, 102, 62, 551, 15295, 9407, 237, 329, 267, 2, 62, 267, 9407, 92, 16, 41, 5, 380, 38, 51, 198, 2542, 655, 36, 16, 447, 46, 99, 3061, 3, 336, 2, 1418, 1144, 1, 9407, 2, 211, 336, 6628, 29, 329, 132, 62, 2, 102, 62, 2, 195, 377, 3840, 1, 2545, 9, 8, 2372, 1808, 2720, 36, 353, 4, 9407]",1017.0,29991687,Integrative genomic adult mixed phenotype acute leukemia delineates lineage associated molecular subtypes,24,0.02622950819672131
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a clonally unrelated second primary malignancy after multiple myeloma.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-07-19,"Multiple myeloma (MM) patients have an 11-fold increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasms compared to the general population; however, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rarely observed. Given that both MM and the majority of ALL are of B cell origin, this raises the question of whether ALL in patients with MM arises from the same clone. We report 13 cases of B-cell ALL following therapy for MM. The interval from MM diagnosis to ALL onset was 5.4 years (range 3.3-10). The median age at the time of ALL diagnosis was 60 years (range 43-67). MM therapy included immunomodulatory agents in all patients and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in 10 (77%) patients preceding ALL diagnosis. ALL genetics showed a normal karyotype, TP53 mutation/deletion, and monosomy 7 or 7q deletion in 5, 3, and 2 cases, respectively. Analysis of paired samples of MM and ALL using whole exome sequencing demonstrated that the malignancies arose from different clones.

Treatment of young adults with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma: Hyper-CVAD vs. pediatric-inspired regimens.,American journal of hematology,Am. J.

In this review, we highlight new targeted therapies in ALL, with an emphasis on immunotherapy. Major advances include antibody-based therapies, such as naked monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific T cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, as well as adoptive cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Apart from the above immunotherapeutic approaches, other targeted therapies are being employed in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, Philadelphia-like (Ph-like) ALL, and T cell ALL.

Baseline characteristics and outcomes of children with cancer in the English-speaking Caribbean: A multinational retrospective cohort.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-08-09,"English-speaking Caribbean (ESC) childhood cancer outcomes are unknown. Through the SickKids-Caribbean Initiative (SCI), we established a multicenter childhood cancer database across seven centers in six ESC countries. Data managers entered patient demographics, disease, treatment, and outcome data. Data collection commenced in 2013, with retrospective collection to 2011 and subsequent prospective collection. A total of 367 children were diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 with a median age of 5.7 years (interquartile range 2.9-10.6 years). One hundred thirty (35.4%) patients were diagnosed with leukemia, 30 (8.2%) with lymphoma, and 149 (40.6%) with solid tumors. A relative paucity of children with brain tumors was seen (N = 58, 15.8%). Two-year event-free survival (EFS) for the cohort was 48.5% ± 3.2%; 2-year overall survival (OS) was 55.1% ± 3.1%. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumor (WT) experienced better 2-year EFS (62.1% ± 6.4% and 66.7% ± 10.1%), while dismal outcomes were seen in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 22.7 ± 9.6%), rhabdomyosarcoma (21.0% ± 17.0%), and medulloblastoma (21.4% ± 17.8%). Of 108 deaths with known cause, 58 (53.7%) were attributed to disease and 50 (46.3%) to treatment complications. Death within 60 days of diagnosis was relatively common in acute leukemia [13/98 (13.3%) ALL, 8/26 (30.8%) AML]. Despite this, traditional prognosticators adversely impacted outcome in ALL, including higher age, higher white blood cell count, and T-cell lineage.

The advances in therapy of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2018-08-27,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive myeloid malignancy that contributes to <1% of all hematologic neoplasms. Before the introduction of various targeted agents, the therapeutic approach was based on regimens used for acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (e.g. hyperCVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine) and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) -based regimens) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible patients. Given that this disease primarily affects older patients, there is a significant barrier to using these highly toxic regimens, even though these regimens are usually associated with the most durable response. In this review, we briefly discuss outcomes with the use of leukemia-based induction regimens as well as the use of stem cell transplant. We also review low-intensity chemotherapeutic regimens. Finally, we will describe both preclinical and early clinical data regarding novel targeted strategies for treating BPDCN without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with a focus on the use of CD123 directed therapy. While the current standard treatment for BPDCN is acute leukemia-based regimen followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for transplant-eligible patients, there are very promising results for CD123 directed therapies.

Comparative Analysis of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Based Methotrexate and Mycophenolate Mofetil-Containing Regimens for Prevention of Graft-versus-Host Disease after Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-08-25,"The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) such as tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine (CYSP) with methotrexate (MTX) or with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been commonly used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), but there are limited data comparing efficacy of the 2 regimens. We evaluated 1564 adult patients who underwent RIC alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 2000 to 2013 using HLA-identical sibling (matched related donor [MRD]) or unrelated donor (URD) peripheral blood graft and received CYSP or TAC with MTX or MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. Primary outcomes of the study were acute and chronic GVHD and overall survival (OS). The study divided the patient population into 4 cohorts based on regimen: MMF-TAC, MMF-CYSP, MTX-TAC, and MTX-CYSP. In the URD group, MMF-CYSP was associated with increased risk of grade II to IV acute GVHD (relative risk [RR], 1.78; P < .001) and grade III to IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.93; P = .006) compared with MTX-TAC. In the URD group, use of MMF-TAC (versus MTX-TAC) lead to higher nonrelapse mortality. (hazard ratio, 1.48; P = .008). In either group, no there was no difference in chronic GVHD, disease-free survival, and OS among the GVHD prophylaxis regimens.

Activating PAX gene family paralogs to complement PAX5 leukemia driver mutations.,PLoS genetics,PLoS Genet.,2018-09-14,"PAX5, one of nine members of the mammalian paired box (PAX) family of transcription factors, plays an important role in B cell development. Approximately one-third of individuals with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acquire heterozygous inactivating mutations of PAX5 in malignant cells, and heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 mutations cause autosomal dominant predisposition to ALL. At least in mice, Pax5 is required for pre-B cell maturation, and leukemic remission occurs when Pax5 expression is restored in a Pax5-deficient mouse model of ALL. Together, these observations indicate that PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis. PAX5 and its two most closely related paralogs, PAX2 and PAX8, which are not mutated in ALL, exhibit overlapping expression and function redundantly during embryonic development. However, PAX5 alone is expressed in lymphocytes, while PAX2 and PAX8 are predominantly specific to kidney and thyroid, respectively. We show that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function mutation in ALL cells as determined by modulation of PAX5 target genes, restoration of immunophenotypic and morphological differentiation, and, ultimately, reduction of replicative potential. Activation of PAX5 paralogs, PAX2 or PAX8, ordinarily silenced in lymphocytes, may therefore represent a novel approach for treating PAX5-deficient ALL. In pursuit of this strategy, we took advantage of the fact that, in kidney, PAX2 is upregulated by extracellular hyperosmolarity. We found that hyperosmolarity, at potentially clinically achievable levels, transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 in ALL cells via a mechanism dependent on NFAT5, a transcription factor coordinating response to hyperosmolarity. We also found that hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression in ALL cells and modulates gene expression, including in PAX5-mutant primary ALL cells. These findings specifically demonstrate that osmosensing pathways may represent a new therapeutic target for ALL and more broadly point toward the possibility of using gene paralogs to rescue mutations driving cancer and other diseases.",Journal Article,494.0,1.0,PAX5 members mammalian paired box PAX family transcription factors plays important role B development Approximately one-third individuals pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia acquire heterozygous inactivating PAX5 malignant heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 cause autosomal dominant predisposition mice Pax5 required pre-B maturation leukemic remission occurs Pax5 expression restored Pax5-deficient mouse model observations indicate PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis PAX5 closely related paralogs PAX2 PAX8 exhibit overlapping expression function redundantly embryonic development PAX5 expressed lymphocytes PAX2 PAX8 predominantly specific kidney thyroid respectively forced expression PAX2 PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function determined modulation PAX5 target restoration immunophenotypic morphological differentiation ultimately reduction replicative potential Activation PAX5 paralogs PAX2 PAX8 ordinarily silenced lymphocytes represent novel approach treating PAX5-deficient pursuit strategy took advantage fact kidney PAX2 upregulated extracellular hyperosmolarity hyperosmolarity potentially clinically achievable levels transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 mechanism dependent NFAT5 transcription factor coordinating response hyperosmolarity hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression modulates expression including PAX5-mutant primary findings specifically demonstrate osmosensing pathways represent new therapeutic target broadly point possibility paralogs rescue driving diseases,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[6279, 104, 1, 762, 1684, 1, 3, 2359, 2355, 4971, 12691, 607, 1, 866, 130, 1698, 35, 305, 200, 4, 132, 31, 193, 705, 104, 1282, 1, 869, 5, 671, 132, 286, 1275, 62, 6206, 4167, 6096, 138, 1, 6279, 4, 393, 37, 2, 4167, 1009, 407, 1, 343, 6279, 138, 708, 6084, 2156, 2863, 6, 62, 28, 506, 4, 399, 6279, 16, 616, 9, 671, 132, 31, 4537, 2, 2015, 734, 1780, 198, 6279, 55, 16, 4138, 4, 8, 6279, 1971, 830, 202, 1, 62, 1162, 46, 2172, 1008, 17, 6279, 2299, 15837, 5267, 5661, 6279, 2, 211, 100, 96, 3210, 139, 22624, 15730, 2, 8958, 92, 32, 44, 1185, 4, 62, 2239, 4551, 55, 2, 343, 38702, 190, 5390, 193, 137, 6279, 279, 16, 570, 4, 1594, 369, 15730, 2, 8958, 32, 2117, 112, 6, 2, 106, 21, 514, 17, 5216, 55, 1, 15730, 15, 8958, 20576, 6279, 407, 1, 343, 258, 4, 62, 37, 22, 509, 20, 2356, 1, 6279, 283, 214, 5194, 1, 6599, 2, 4268, 910, 2, 2050, 628, 1, 14529, 174, 363, 1, 6279, 22624, 15730, 15, 8958, 49573, 5442, 4, 1594, 68, 673, 1231, 8, 229, 353, 9, 1367, 6279, 1971, 62, 4, 13649, 1, 26, 692, 21, 5060, 1874, 1, 3, 1991, 17, 4, 15730, 16, 2684, 20, 1976, 30383, 21, 204, 17, 30383, 28, 751, 505, 6171, 148, 6851, 3932, 2682, 15730, 4, 62, 37, 847, 8, 670, 470, 23, 73566, 8, 866, 161, 17428, 51, 6, 30383, 21, 120, 204, 17, 30383, 9641, 753, 955, 267, 6279, 55, 4, 62, 37, 2, 5259, 145, 55, 141, 4, 6279, 620, 86, 62, 37, 46, 272, 1225, 608, 17, 73567, 460, 68, 1231, 8, 217, 189, 283, 9, 62, 2, 80, 5482, 741, 1317, 3, 2526, 1, 75, 145, 22624, 6, 4256, 138, 4057, 12, 2, 127, 1342]",2096.0,30216339,Activating PAX family paralogs complement PAX5 leukemia driver,17,0.018579234972677595

Adults with Philadelphia Chromosome-Like Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Considerations for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in First Complete Remission.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-10-05,"Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subset of high-risk B cell ALLs. A large proportion of Ph-like ALL cases carry activating kinase mutations that could potentially allow them to be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ph-like ALL is not an uncommon entity, especially among adults, with a frequency exceeding 20%, including in older patients (>60 years old) with ALL. Ph-like ALL is associated with inferior outcomes across all ages, and studies have consistently shown a higher incidence of persistent postinduction minimal residual disease in patients carrying Ph-like ALL compared with other subgroups of ALL, and this translates into inferior leukemia-related outcomes. The inferior outcome of conventional chemotherapy for Ph-like ALL in adults raises the fundamental question of whether all adults with Ph-like ALL require an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission (CR1) regardless of other presenting features and treatment response parameters. Here we present and discuss several scenarios in which adults with Ph-like ALL underwent or were considered for HCT in CR1 for various reasons. Although the decision to proceed with HCT was clear and indisputable in some of these situations, in others we struggled with the decision to transplant in CR1 because of the lack of published data regarding the efficacy of allogeneic HCT as consolidation for Ph-like ALL.

Inotuzumab was given on day 3 of each of the first 4 cycles at 1.8 to 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for cycle 1, and this was followed by 1.3 to 1.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for subsequent cycles. From patient 39 onward, the inotuzumab dose was reduced and fractionated into weekly doses (0.6 and 0.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> during cycle 1 and 0.3 and 0.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> during subsequent cycles), and blinatumomab was administered for up to 4 cycles after inotuzumab therapy. Forty-eight patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL with a median age of 39 years were treated during their first relapse. Overall, 44 patients (92%) responded, with 35 of them (73%) achieving a complete response. The overall minimal residual disease negativity rate among the responders was 93%. Twenty-four patients (50%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Veno-occlusive disease of any grade occurred in 5 patients (10%). With a median follow-up of 31 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and the median overall survival (OS) were 11 and 25 months, respectively. The 2-year PFS and OS rates were 42% and 54%, respectively. Of the 24 patients (50%) who underwent ASCT, 14 patients were alive at the last follow-up (13 [54%] in remission). Of the remaining 20 responding patients who did not undergo subsequent ASCT, 6 (30%) remained in remission at the last follow-up. According to propensity score matching, the combination of mini-HCVD and inotuzumab with or without blinatumomab conferred better outcomes than intensive salvage chemotherapy or inotuzumab alone. The combination of inotuzumab and low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy with or without blinatumomab shows encouraging results in patients with ALL in first salvage.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",467.0,21.0,outcomes patients relapsed refractory R-R acute lymphoblastic leukemia poor Inotuzumab ozogamicin blinatumomab single-agent activity R-R addition low-intensity chemotherapy improve outcomes patients relapse chemotherapy lower intensity conventional hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine adriamycin dexamethasone called mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide vincristine dexamethasone mini-HCVD Inotuzumab given day 3 4 cycles 1.8 1.3 mg/m sup 2 /sup cycle 1 followed 1.3 1.0 mg/m sup 2 /sup subsequent cycles patient 39 onward inotuzumab dose reduced fractionated weekly doses 0.6 0.3 mg/m sup 2 /sup cycle 1 0.3 0.3 mg/m sup 2 /sup subsequent cycles blinatumomab administered 4 cycles inotuzumab therapy Forty-eight patients Philadelphia chromosome-negative median age 39 years treated relapse Overall 44 patients 92 responded 35 73 achieving complete response overall minimal residual disease negativity rate responders 93 Twenty-four patients 50 underwent allogeneic stem transplantation ASCT Veno-occlusive disease grade occurred 5 patients 10 median follow-up 31 months median progression-free survival PFS median overall survival OS 11 25 months respectively 2-year PFS OS rates 42 54 respectively 24 patients 50 underwent ASCT 14 patients alive follow-up 13 54 remission remaining 20 responding patients undergo subsequent ASCT 6 30 remained remission follow-up According propensity score matching combination mini-HCVD inotuzumab blinatumomab conferred better outcomes intensive salvage chemotherapy inotuzumab combination inotuzumab low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy blinatumomab shows encouraging patients salvage,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 123, 1, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 668, 668, 286, 1275, 62, 32, 334, 6730, 5566, 2, 7182, 47, 226, 420, 128, 4, 668, 668, 62, 136, 352, 6, 154, 837, 56, 68, 195, 401, 3, 123, 1, 7, 5, 62, 4, 136, 157, 429, 3, 56, 10, 280, 4, 837, 76, 809, 6201, 1112, 2132, 7700, 2, 1217, 2, 10, 3472, 7313, 6201, 1112, 2132, 2, 1217, 15, 7313, 32786, 6730, 10, 447, 23, 218, 27, 1, 296, 1, 3, 157, 39, 410, 28, 14, 66, 6, 14, 27, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 9, 417, 14, 2, 26, 10, 370, 20, 14, 27, 6, 14, 13, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 9, 706, 410, 29, 69, 587, 15088, 3, 6730, 61, 10, 405, 2, 3950, 237, 709, 415, 13, 49, 2, 13, 27, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 190, 417, 14, 2, 13, 27, 2, 13, 27, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 190, 706, 410, 2, 7182, 10, 468, 9, 126, 6, 39, 410, 50, 6730, 36, 1213, 659, 7, 5, 3006, 1170, 199, 62, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 587, 60, 11, 73, 190, 136, 157, 429, 63, 584, 7, 937, 2211, 5, 465, 1, 1370, 803, 1785, 8, 236, 51, 3, 63, 1048, 753, 34, 6014, 116, 107, 3, 1983, 10, 966, 737, 294, 7, 212, 208, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 1584, 10273, 8376, 34, 1, 500, 88, 489, 4, 33, 7, 79, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 456, 53, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 3, 52, 63, 25, 118, 11, 175, 2, 243, 53, 106, 3, 18, 111, 300, 2, 118, 151, 11, 595, 2, 667, 106, 1, 3, 259, 7, 212, 54, 208, 1584, 213, 7, 11, 1701, 28, 3, 1060, 166, 126, 233, 667, 4, 734, 1, 3, 1844, 179, 3261, 7, 54, 205, 44, 1251, 706, 1584, 49, 201, 958, 4, 734, 28, 3, 1060, 166, 126, 768, 6, 1925, 368, 2616, 3, 150, 1, 7313, 32786, 2, 6730, 5, 15, 187, 7182, 3851, 380, 123, 76, 1686, 992, 56, 15, 6730, 279, 3, 150, 1, 6730, 2, 154, 837, 7313, 32786, 56, 5, 15, 187, 7182, 1949, 2269, 99, 4, 7, 5, 62, 4, 157, 992]",2190.0,30307611,Chemoimmunotherapy inotuzumab ozogamicin combined mini-hyper-CVD blinatumomab highly effective patients Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia salvage,2,0.002185792349726776
"Changes in body mass index, height, and weight in children during and after therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2018-10-25,"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have an increased risk of obesity and short stature. To the authors' knowledge, data regarding patients treated on contemporary protocols without cranial irradiation are limited. Changes in z scores for body mass index (BMI), height, and weight from the time of diagnosis to 5 years off therapy were evaluated using multivariable analysis in 372 children with ALL who were aged 2 to 18 years at the time of diagnosis and were enrolled on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV protocol from 2000 through 2007. The percentage of overweight/obese patients increased from 25.5% at the time of diagnosis to approximately 50% during the off-therapy period. Median BMI z scores increased significantly during glucocorticoid therapy (induction: ∆0.56; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29-0.64 [P<.001]; and reinduction II: ∆0.22; 95% CI, 0.13-0.49 [P=.001]) and during the first year after therapy (∆0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.46 [P=.006]). Among patients who were of healthy weight/underweight at the time of diagnosis, those aged 2 to <10 years at diagnosis had a significantly higher risk of becoming overweight/obese during or after therapy compared with those aged ≥10 years (P=.001). Height z scores declined during treatment and improved after therapy. Being aged 2 to <10 years at the time of diagnosis, being of low-risk status, having a white blood cell count < 50×10<sup>9</sup> /L at the time of diagnosis, and having negative central nervous system disease were associated with significantly better improvements in z scores for height during the off-therapy period compared with being aged ≥10 years, being of standard-risk/high-risk status, having a white blood cell count  ≥ 50×10<sup>9</sup> /L, and having positive central nervous system disease, respectively. The results of the current study demonstrate that obesity is prevalent, and height growth, especially in patients with identified risk factors, appears compromised.

PRC2 loss induces chemoresistance by repressing apoptosis in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,The Journal of experimental medicine,J. Exp. Med.,2018-11-07,"The tendency of mitochondria to undergo or resist BCL2-controlled apoptosis (so-called mitochondrial priming) is a powerful predictor of response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Fully exploiting this finding will require unraveling the molecular genetics underlying phenotypic variability in mitochondrial priming. Here, we report that mitochondrial apoptosis resistance in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is mediated by inactivation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).

How I treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2018-11-15,"The introduction of agents targeted at specific molecular events is changing the treatment paradigms in a number of malignancies. Historically, we have relied entirely on DNA-interactive, cytotoxic drugs for treating patients with leukemia. Increased understanding of the leukemic cell biology and pathogenesis, and the ways they evade the immune surveillance mechanisms, will likely lead to the development of more effective agents, and regimens less reliant on chemotherapy, able to achieve deep levels of disease eradication. In Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the introduction of increasingly potent tyrosine kinas inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy. These drugs have been established as the cornerstone of any therapeutic strategy in this disease, and a number of trials have better defined the best ways to incorporate them into the established paradigms. Despite using TKIs, we have continued to remain reliant on cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant to achieve the best long-term outcomes.

Should immunologic strategies be incorporated into frontline ALL therapy?,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2018-09-25,"Survival rates in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have markedly improved during the past decade. The one-size-fits-all-ages approach has been replaced with adaptation of pediatric-inspired treatment protocols for younger adults. Yet different treatment strategies for older patients are needed due to chemotherapy-related toxicities. A new era of immunotherapy has arrived, offering opportunities for targeted treatments for ALL subtypes. While CD20 targeting with rituximab has been demonstrated to improve survival when combined with chemotherapy, it has little activity as a single agent in ALL. In contrast, antibody targeting of CD19 and CD22 with blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin, respectively, has had remarkable single-agent activity in the relapsed setting. Studies are now underway to test these agents in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting. The goal of these studies is to improve event-free survival and overall survival by using these approaches in the frontline to eradicate minimal residual disease and, particularly in older adults with ALL, to reduce treatment-related toxicity by limiting the exposure to traditional multi-agent chemotherapy with its attendant toxicities. This review focuses on new immunotherapeutic treatment options and strategies for frontline treatment, including a brief discussion of the use of true immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, for relapsed B-cell ALL, the potential for targeting CD38 in T-cell ALL, and how these approaches are facilitating the next steps to improve survival for adult patients with ALL.",Journal Article,483.0,0.0,Survival rates adult patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia markedly improved past decade one-size-fits-all-ages approach replaced adaptation pediatric-inspired treatment protocols younger adults different treatment strategies older patients needed chemotherapy-related toxicities new era immunotherapy arrived offering opportunities targeted treatments subtypes CD20 targeting rituximab demonstrated improve survival combined chemotherapy little activity single agent contrast antibody targeting CD19 CD22 blinatumomab inotuzumab ozogamicin respectively remarkable single-agent activity relapsed setting Studies underway test agents combination chemotherapy frontline setting goal studies improve event-free survival overall survival approaches frontline eradicate minimal residual disease particularly older adults reduce treatment-related toxicity limiting exposure traditional multi-agent chemotherapy attendant toxicities review focuses new immunotherapeutic treatment options strategies frontline treatment including brief discussion use true immunotherapy chimeric antigen receptor T-cells relapsed B-cell potential targeting CD38 T-cell approaches facilitating steps improve survival adult patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[25, 151, 4, 780, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 47, 2195, 231, 190, 3, 1219, 2025, 3, 104, 444, 11688, 62, 2165, 353, 71, 85, 6928, 5, 7275, 1, 815, 13161, 24, 2189, 9, 773, 857, 1145, 338, 24, 422, 9, 434, 7, 32, 575, 520, 6, 56, 139, 385, 8, 217, 1713, 1, 726, 71, 17855, 5846, 2605, 9, 238, 640, 9, 62, 814, 369, 2198, 529, 5, 855, 71, 85, 264, 6, 401, 25, 198, 397, 5, 56, 192, 71, 1215, 128, 22, 8, 226, 420, 4, 62, 4, 748, 548, 529, 1, 3158, 2, 7599, 5, 7182, 2, 6730, 5566, 106, 71, 42, 3813, 226, 420, 128, 4, 3, 591, 546, 94, 32, 1134, 3948, 6, 412, 46, 183, 4, 150, 5, 56, 4, 3, 3171, 546, 3, 1326, 1, 46, 94, 16, 6, 401, 774, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 20, 75, 46, 611, 4, 3, 3171, 6, 5650, 1048, 753, 34, 2, 823, 4, 434, 857, 5, 62, 6, 969, 24, 139, 155, 20, 817, 3, 645, 6, 1847, 1414, 420, 56, 5, 211, 18307, 385, 26, 206, 3026, 23, 217, 3222, 24, 838, 2, 422, 9, 3171, 24, 141, 8, 3190, 2488, 1, 3, 119, 1, 2501, 726, 2897, 448, 153, 102, 37, 9, 591, 132, 31, 62, 3, 174, 9, 529, 4469, 4, 102, 31, 62, 2, 832, 46, 611, 32, 5379, 3, 1305, 4022, 6, 401, 25, 9, 780, 7, 5, 62]",1587.0,30466749,immunologic strategies incorporated frontline therapy,1,0.001092896174863388

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2018-11-28,"Most B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL) can be classified into known major genetic subtypes, while a substantial proportion of BCP ALL remains poorly characterized in relation to its underlying genomic abnormalities. We therefore initiated a large-scale international study to reanalyze and delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 BCP ALL cases using RNA sequencing. Fourteen BCP ALL gene expression subgroups (G1 to G14) were identified. Apart from extending eight previously described subgroups (G1 to G8 associated with <i>MEF2D</i> fusions, <i>TCF3-PBX1</i> fusions, <i>ETV6-RUNX1</i>-positive/<i>ETV6-RUNX1</i>-like, <i>DUX4</i> fusions, <i>ZNF384</i> fusions, <i>BCR-ABL1</i>/Ph-like, high hyperdiploidy, and <i>KMT2A</i> fusions), we defined six additional gene expression subgroups: G9 was associated with both <i>PAX5</i> and <i>CRLF2</i> fusions; G10 and G11 with mutations in <i>PAX5</i> (p.P80R) and <i>IKZF1</i> (p.N159Y), respectively; G12 with <i>IGH-CEBPE</i> fusion and mutations in <i>ZEB2</i> (p.H1038R); and G13 and G14 with <i>TCF3/4-HLF</i> and <i>NUTM1</i> fusions, respectively. In pediatric BCP ALL, subgroups G2 to G5 and G7 (51 to 65/67 chromosomes) were associated with low-risk, G7 (with ≤50 chromosomes) and G9 were intermediate-risk, whereas G1, G6, and G8 were defined as high-risk subgroups. In adult BCP ALL, G1, G2, G6, and G8 were associated with high risk, while G4, G5, and G7 had relatively favorable outcomes. This large-scale transcriptome sequence analysis of BCP ALL revealed distinct molecular subgroups that reflect discrete pathways of BCP ALL, informing disease classification and prognostic stratification.

Novel susceptibility variants at the <i>ERG</i> locus for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics.,Blood,Blood,2018-12-03,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. Characterized by high levels of Native American ancestry, Hispanics are disproportionally affected by this cancer with high incidence and inferior survival. However, the genetic basis for this disparity remains poorly understood because of a paucity of genome-wide investigation of ALL in Hispanics. Performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 940 Hispanic children with ALL and 681 ancestry-matched non-ALL controls, we identified a novel susceptibility locus in the <i>ERG</i> gene (rs2836365; <i>P</i> = 3.76 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; odds ratio [OR] = 1.56), with independent validation (<i>P</i> = .01; OR = 1.43). Imputation analyses pointed to a single causal variant driving the association signal at this locus overlapping with putative regulatory DNA elements. The effect size of the <i>ERG</i> risk variant rose with increasing Native American genetic ancestry.

The incidence of Bacillus bloodstream infections and characteristics of infection among children with cancer or indication for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is unknown. We performed a retrospective medical record review of all cases of Bacillus bacteremia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital. We report average incidences from 2012 to 2014. We performed a detailed review of infections among children with cancer or undergoing HCT and a case-control study to evaluate whether neutropenia at diagnosis caries higher risk of Bacillus infection for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One hundred fourteen children developed Bacillus bacteremia during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 0.27/1,000 patients. Among children treated for cancer or undergoing HCT, there were 37 bloodstream infections (2.0/1,000 patients). Of the 37 oncology/HCT patients, oncologic diagnoses included ALL (18), acute myeloid leukemia (3), myelodysplastic syndrome (1), solid tumors (8), and 7 children were undergoing HCT. The incidence of infection among children with ALL was 34/1,000 patients and all central nervous system (CNS) infections (6) and deaths (3) occurred in this population. Neutropenia at time of diagnosis in children with ALL was not associated with risk of infection (P = 0.17).

The Impact of Low-Dose Cranial Boost on the Long-Term Outcomes of Adult Patients with High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Undergoing Total Body Irradiation and Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,Practical radiation oncology,Pract Radiat Oncol,2018-12-20,"Total body irradiation (TBI) is an integral part of the conditioning regimen for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing allogeneic, hematopoietic, cell transplantation (allo-HCT). There are conflicting data in the literature regarding the utility of a cranial irradiation boost in high-risk adult ALL without evidence of preexisting central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study investigates the posttransplant clinical outcomes of patients with high-risk adult ALL undergoing TBI conditioning for allo-HCT with or without a whole-brain boost, without overt CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a medical record analysis. We identified 58 patients who were treated between January 1998 and December 2016, and met our preset inclusion criteria of adults (age >18 years old) who carried a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of CNS-negative, high-risk ALL, who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with TBI conditioning. A multivariate analysis of correlation between patient outcomes and collected categorical variables was assessed with stepwise Cox logistic regression. Survival analyses were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier technique with a log-rank test. With a median follow-up time of 5.3 years, there was a statistically significant improvement in actuarial 7-year CNS relapse-free survival (100% vs 76.4%; P = .043) in favor of patients undergoing a cranial boost. There was no statistically significant improvement in 7-year progression-free survival (78.3% vs 62.5%; P = .076) or overall survival (49.4% vs 43.5%; P = .921) with versus without a cranial boost. On multivariate analysis, the presence of a cranial boost was the only identified variable with an independent relationship to CNS relapse-free survival. Adult patients with high-risk, CNS-negative ALL were found to have a statistically significant improvement in CNS relapse-free survival and a trend toward improved progression-free survival with the inclusion of a cranial boost with TBI pretransplant conditioning. Our data indicate that further investigation into the use of cranial boost in this patient population is warranted.",Clinical Trial,397.0,0.0,Total body irradiation TBI integral conditioning regimen patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation allo-HCT conflicting literature utility cranial irradiation boost high-risk adult evidence preexisting central nervous CNS involvement investigates posttransplant clinical outcomes patients high-risk adult undergoing TBI conditioning allo-HCT whole-brain boost overt CNS involvement time diagnosis retrospective cohort conducted medical record identified 58 patients treated January 1998 December 2016 met preset inclusion criteria adults age 18 years old carried pathologically confirmed diagnosis CNS-negative high-risk underwent hematopoietic stem transplantation TBI conditioning multivariate correlation patient outcomes collected categorical variables assessed stepwise Cox logistic regression Survival assessed Kaplan-Meier technique log-rank test median follow-up time 5.3 years statistically significant improvement actuarial 7-year CNS relapse-free survival 100 vs 76.4 P .043 favor patients undergoing cranial boost statistically significant improvement 7-year progression-free survival 78.3 vs 62.5 P .076 overall survival 49.4 vs 43.5 P .921 versus cranial boost multivariate presence cranial boost identified variable independent relationship CNS relapse-free survival Adult patients high-risk CNS-negative statistically significant improvement CNS relapse-free survival trend improved progression-free survival inclusion cranial boost TBI pretransplant conditioning indicate investigation use cranial boost patient population warranted,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[181, 642, 1104, 4889, 16, 35, 4450, 760, 1, 3, 1933, 477, 9, 7, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 479, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 2564, 1085, 125, 32, 4274, 74, 4, 3, 789, 666, 3, 1207, 1, 8, 2565, 1104, 2569, 4, 64, 43, 780, 62, 187, 241, 1, 5004, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 799, 26, 45, 7259, 3, 7346, 38, 123, 1, 7, 5, 64, 43, 780, 62, 479, 4889, 1933, 9, 2564, 1085, 5, 15, 187, 8, 902, 342, 2569, 187, 7192, 1025, 799, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 8, 459, 180, 45, 10, 426, 75, 8, 484, 3237, 65, 21, 108, 717, 7, 54, 11, 73, 59, 1024, 1850, 2, 1397, 1390, 2, 543, 114, 35804, 1680, 371, 1, 857, 89, 203, 60, 1095, 54, 2629, 8, 2998, 557, 147, 1, 1025, 199, 64, 43, 62, 54, 208, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 5, 4889, 1933, 8, 331, 65, 1, 816, 59, 69, 123, 2, 786, 5982, 682, 10, 275, 5, 5497, 418, 812, 320, 25, 318, 11, 275, 75, 3, 876, 882, 1312, 5, 8, 1066, 1026, 412, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 98, 1, 33, 27, 60, 125, 10, 8, 712, 93, 767, 4, 2361, 67, 111, 1025, 429, 115, 25, 394, 105, 846, 39, 19, 5653, 4, 4283, 1, 7, 479, 8, 2565, 2569, 125, 10, 77, 712, 93, 767, 4, 67, 111, 91, 115, 25, 833, 27, 105, 744, 33, 19, 13973, 15, 63, 25, 739, 39, 105, 601, 33, 19, 15223, 5, 185, 187, 8, 2565, 2569, 23, 331, 65, 3, 463, 1, 8, 2565, 2569, 10, 3, 158, 108, 1347, 5, 35, 306, 858, 6, 1025, 429, 115, 25, 780, 7, 5, 64, 43, 1025, 199, 62, 11, 204, 6, 47, 8, 712, 93, 767, 4, 1025, 429, 115, 25, 2, 8, 853, 1317, 231, 91, 115, 25, 5, 3, 1680, 1, 8, 2565, 2569, 5, 4889, 7763, 1933, 114, 74, 1008, 17, 195, 940, 237, 3, 119, 1, 2565, 2569, 4, 26, 69, 266, 16, 1197]",2136.0,30578956,Impact Low-Dose Cranial Boost Long-Term Outcomes Adult Patients High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Undergoing Total Body Irradiation Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Transplantation,1,0.001092896174863388
Modeling anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in humanized mice with human immunity and autologous leukemia.,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,2018-12-20,"Adoptive immunotherapy using T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 has produced remarkable clinical outcomes. However, much of the mechanisms of action, such as the development of memory responses and sources of immune cytokines, remain elusive largely due to the challenge of characterizing human CAR T cell function in vivo. The lack of a suitable in vivo model also hinders the development of new CAR T cell therapies. We established a humanized mouse (hu-mouse) model with a functional human immune system and genetically-matched (autologous) primary acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that permits modeling of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy in immunocompetent hosts without allogeneic or xenogeneic immune responses. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were detected in blood of leukemic hu-mice with kinetics and levels similar to those seen in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy.

Inotuzumab: from preclinical development to success in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2019-01-01,"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is a recently US Food and Drug Administration-approved antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). InO consists of a CD22-targeting immunoglobulin G4 humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated to calicheamicin. Although initially developed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) because of activity in preclinical models and high response rates in indolent lymphomas, a phase 3 trial was negative and further development focused on CD22<sup>+</sup> ALL. Although results in NHL were disappointing, parallel testing in early-phase trials of CD22<sup>+</sup> ALL demonstrated feasibility and efficacy. Subsequently, the randomized phase 3 Study Of Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Versus Investigator's Choice Of Chemotherapy In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia trial showed that InO was superior to standard of care regimens with a significantly improved complete remission (CR) rate in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (80.7% vs 29.4%, <i>P</i> < .001). Patients achieving CR with InO also had a significantly higher rate of undetectable minimal residual disease compared with chemotherapy (78.4% vs 28.1%, <i>P</i> < .001). InO-specific side effects, including veno-occlusive disease, have been an ongoing area of concern, and consensus guidelines for minimizing toxicities are now available.

Data as of March 8, 2016, are presented in this analysis. Of the 326 patients randomized, 284 had screening karyotyping data (144 in the InO arm and 140 in the standard care [SC] arm). With InO, complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), minimal residual disease negativity rates, and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different between cytogenetic subgroups. CR/CRi rates favored InO over SC in the diploid with ≥20 metaphases, complex, and ""other"" cytogenetic subgroups.

Effect of Neutropenic Diet on Infection Rates in Cancer Patients With Neutropenia: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"Neutropenic diets are commonly prescribed to cancer patients with neutropenia with the intention of reducing rates of infection. These diets are restrictive and are associated with lower patient satisfaction and possibly malnutrition. Further, it is unclear if these restrictive diets are effective in reducing infection. We performed a meta-analysis on the rates of infection reported in trials comparing the neutropenic diet to unrestricted diets in cancer patients with neutropenia. A comprehensive database search for all published randomized controlled trials comparing infection rates in cancer patients receiving a neutropenic diet versus an unrestricted diet was performed for all publications in English language from database's inception until September 12, 2017. The search strategy, study selection, and subsequent analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Random effects modeling was used to obtain pooled relative risks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of infection. Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 388 patients were included in the final analysis. Patients mostly had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or sarcoma. Infection was noted in 53.7% patients in the neutropenic diet group, as compared with 50% in the unrestricted diet group. No significant difference in infection rate was observed between the neutropenic diet versus unrestricted diet groups, pooled risk ratio (RR) 1.13 (95% CI, 0.98-1.30; P=0.10). This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggests that the use of neutropenic diet was not associated with decreased risk of infection in neutropenic cancer patients.

PAX5-driven subtypes of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2019-01-14,"Recent genomic studies have identified chromosomal rearrangements defining new subtypes of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), however many cases lack a known initiating genetic alteration. Using integrated genomic analysis of 1,988 childhood and adult cases, we describe a revised taxonomy of B-ALL incorporating 23 subtypes defined by chromosomal rearrangements, sequence mutations or heterogeneous genomic alterations, many of which show marked variation in prevalence according to age. Two subtypes have frequent alterations of the B lymphoid transcription-factor gene PAX5.

A pediatric regimen for older adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results of CALGB 10403.,Blood,Blood,2019-01-18,"Retrospective studies have suggested that older adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have better survival rates when treated using a pediatric ALL regimen administered by pediatric treatment teams. To address the feasibility and efficacy of using a pediatric treatment regimen for AYA patients with newly diagnosed ALL administered by adult treatment teams, we performed a prospective study, CALGB 10403, with doses and schedule identical to those in the Children's Oncology Group study AALL0232. From 2007 to 2012, 318 patients were enrolled; 295 were eligible and evaluable for response. Median age was 24 years (range, 17-39 years). Use of the pediatric regimen was safe; overall treatment-related mortality was 3%, and there were only 2 postremission deaths. Median event-free survival (EFS) was 78.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.8 to not reached), more than double the historical control of 30 months (95% CI, 22-38 months); 3-year EFS was 59% (95% CI, 54%-65%). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Estimated 3-year OS was 73% (95% CI, 68%-78%). Pretreatment risk factors associated with worse treatment outcomes included obesity and presence of the Philadelphia-like gene expression signature. Use of a pediatric regimen for AYAs with ALL up to age 40 years was feasible and effective, resulting in improved survival rates compared with historical controls. CALGB 10403 can be considered a new treatment standard upon which to build for improving survival for AYAs with ALL.

Bloodstream infections exacerbate incidence and severity of symptomatic glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2019-02-13,"Osteonecrosis is a common toxicity associated with glucocorticoid (e.g., dexamethasone and prednisone) treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but risk factors are incompletely defined. Infections are also a common complication of ALL therapy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is used experimentally to mimic infection-related systemic effects. To our knowledge, the contribution of systemic infections to the risk of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis has not been investigated. Patients with ALL on St. Jude Total Therapy XV (n = 365) were assessed for documented bacteremia prior to development of osteonecrosis, which was confirmed by MRI, and graded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology for Adverse Events (version 3.0). In a preclinical model, Balb/cJ mice treated with dexamethasone plus or minus LPS were assessed for frequency and severity of osteonecrosis and arteriopathy. We found that patients with ALL who experienced bacteremia had a higher frequency of symptomatic osteonecrosis (≥grade 2) than those who did not (OR: 1.88; 95% CI, 1.03-3.41, P = 0.038). LPS exacerbated experimental dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis. Mice treated with dexamethasone plus LPS had a higher incidence of osteonecrosis (P = 0.00086) and arteriopathy (P = 0.0047) than did those treated with dexamethasone alone, and the severity of osteonecrosis (P = 0.00045) and arteriopathy (P = 0.0048) was also more pronounced with the addition of LPS treatment.

Our aim was to apply the internationally endorsed Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines to children (<15 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and to assess differences in survival by stage at diagnosis. Stage was defined by extent of involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) for ALL and AML and using the Ann Arbor and St Jude-Murphy systems for HL and NHL, respectively. The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry, consisting of children diagnosed with one of these four blood cancers between 2006 and 2014 with follow-up to 2015. Five-year observed survival was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier method. Stage was assigned to 2201 of 2351 eligible patients (94%), ranging from 85% for AML to 95% for ALL, HL, and NHL. Survival following ALL varied from 94% (95% CI = 93%-95%) for CNS1 disease to 89% (95% CI = 79%-94%) for CNS2 (P = 0.07), whereas for AML there was essentially no difference in survival between CNS<sup>-</sup> (77%) and CNS<sup>+</sup> disease (78%; P = 0.94).

TBI (1200 or 1320 cGy given twice daily in 6 or 8 fractions) was used as part of 3 HSCT preparative regimens, allowing institutional flexibility regarding TBI techniques, including lung shielding. Lung doses as reported by each participating institution were calculated for different patient setups, with and without shielding, with a variety of dose calculation techniques. The association between lung dose and transplant-related mortality, relapse-free survival, and overall survival (OS) was examined using the Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling for the following variables: TBI dose rate, TBI fields, patient position during TBI, donor type, and pre-HSCT minimal residual disease level. Of a total of 143 eligible patients, 127 had lung doses available for this analysis. The TBI techniques were heterogeneous. The mean lung dose was reported as 904.5 cGy (standard deviation, ±232.3). Patients treated with lateral fields were more likely to receive lung doses ≥800 cGy (P < .001). The influence of lung dose ≥800 cGy on transplant-related mortality was not significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.78; P = .21). On univariate analysis, lung dose ≥800 cGy was associated with inferior relapse-free survival (HR, 1.76; P = .04) and OS (HR, 1.85; P = .03). In the multivariate analysis, OS maintained statistical significance (HR, 1.85; P = .04). The variability in TBI techniques resulted in uncertainty with reported lung doses. Lateral fields were associated with higher lung dose, and thus they should be avoided. Patients treated with lung dose <800 cGy in this study had better outcomes. This approach is currently being investigated in the Children's Oncology Group AALL1331 study. Additionally, the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core Group is evaluating effects of TBI techniques on lung doses using a phantom.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",332.0,2.0,examine relationship lung radiation dose survival outcomes children undergoing total body irradiation TBI -based hematopoietic stem transplantation HSCT acute lymphoblastic leukemia Children 's Oncology Group trial TBI 1200 1320 cGy given twice daily 6 8 fractions 3 HSCT preparative regimens allowing institutional flexibility TBI techniques including lung shielding Lung doses reported participating institution calculated different patient setups shielding variety dose calculation techniques association lung dose transplant-related mortality relapse-free survival overall survival OS examined Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling following variables TBI dose rate TBI fields patient position TBI donor type pre-HSCT minimal residual disease level total 143 eligible patients 127 lung doses available TBI techniques heterogeneous mean lung dose reported 904.5 cGy standard deviation ±232.3 Patients treated lateral fields likely receive lung doses ≥800 cGy P .001 influence lung dose ≥800 cGy transplant-related mortality significant hazard ratio HR 1.78 P .21 univariate lung dose ≥800 cGy associated inferior relapse-free survival HR 1.76 P .04 OS HR 1.85 P .03 multivariate OS maintained statistical significance HR 1.85 P .04 variability TBI techniques resulted uncertainty reported lung doses Lateral fields associated higher lung dose avoided Patients treated lung dose 800 cGy better outcomes approach currently investigated Children 's Oncology Group AALL1331 Additionally Imaging Radiation Oncology Core Group evaluating effects TBI techniques lung doses phantom,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 1004, 3, 858, 59, 121, 61, 2, 25, 123, 4, 541, 479, 181, 642, 1104, 4889, 90, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 9, 286, 1275, 23, 3, 541, 292, 413, 87, 160, 4889, 6847, 15, 74491, 3071, 447, 936, 391, 4, 49, 15, 66, 1550, 10, 95, 22, 760, 1, 27, 1703, 6085, 472, 2952, 1115, 9794, 666, 4889, 1092, 141, 16362, 415, 22, 210, 20, 296, 3052, 731, 11, 981, 9, 338, 69, 23549, 5, 2, 187, 16362, 5, 8, 1362, 1, 61, 6333, 1092, 3, 248, 59, 61, 2, 941, 139, 282, 429, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 118, 10, 409, 75, 3, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 202, 1893, 9, 3, 366, 682, 4889, 61, 116, 4889, 3130, 69, 3559, 190, 4889, 1488, 267, 2, 671, 1703, 1048, 753, 34, 301, 1, 8, 181, 1, 4400, 625, 7, 4080, 42, 415, 390, 9, 26, 65, 3, 4889, 1092, 11, 1564, 3, 313, 61, 10, 210, 22, 13145, 33, 3071, 260, 3348, 74492, 27, 7, 73, 5, 3855, 3130, 11, 80, 322, 6, 560, 415, 31738, 3071, 19, 144, 3, 1054, 1, 61, 31738, 3071, 23, 941, 139, 282, 10, 44, 93, 360, 197, 168, 14, 833, 19, 239, 23, 880, 65, 61, 31738, 3071, 10, 41, 5, 1663, 429, 115, 25, 168, 14, 846, 19, 755, 2, 118, 168, 14, 772, 19, 680, 4, 3, 331, 65, 118, 1955, 1050, 724, 168, 14, 772, 19, 755, 3, 1982, 4, 4889, 1092, 627, 4, 4004, 5, 210, 415, 3855, 3130, 11, 41, 5, 142, 61, 2, 631, 491, 257, 40, 5617, 7, 73, 5, 61, 2796, 3071, 4, 26, 45, 42, 380, 123, 26, 353, 16, 694, 486, 565, 4, 3, 541, 292, 413, 87, 74493, 45, 1724, 3, 270, 2, 121, 413, 1793, 87, 16, 1435, 176, 1, 4889, 1092, 23, 415, 75, 8, 6755]",1946.0,30807822,Higher Reported Lung Dose Received Total Body Irradiation Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Transplantation Children Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Associated Inferior Survival Report Children 's Oncology Group,12,0.013114754098360656
"Clinical presentation, management, and biomarkers of neurotoxicity after adoptive immunotherapy with CAR T cells.",Blood,Blood,2019-02-26,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as a promising class of cell-based immunotherapy in refractory malignancies. Neurotoxicity represents a common and potentially life-threatening adverse effect of CAR T cells, and clinical experience is limited. Here, we describe the clinical presentation and management of 25 adult patients who presented with neurotoxic syndromes after CAR T-cell therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital. This cohort includes 24 patients treated with CD19-directed CAR T cells for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 23) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1), and 1 patient treated with α-fetoprotein-directed CAR T cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1). Twelve of the 25 patients (48%) developed grade 1-2 neurotoxicity and 13 patients (52%) presented with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity. We found that lower platelet counts at time of CAR T-cell infusion were associated with more severe neurotoxicity (<i>P</i> = .030). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 24 of 25 patients (96%). Serum levels of ferritin peaked with onset of neurologic symptoms, and higher ferritin levels were associated with higher neurotoxicity grade. Grade 3-4 neurotoxicity correlated negatively with overall survival (OS) (<i>P</i> = .013). Median OS of the entire cohort was 54.7 weeks. Eight patients (32%) with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity were deceased at database closure, whereas none died with neurotoxicity grade 1-2. High pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase was frequently encountered in lymphoma patients with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity and correlated negatively with progression-free survival (<i>P</i> = .048).

Blinatumomab administered concurrently with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is a well-tolerated consolidation strategy and eradicates measurable residual disease in adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2019-02-23,"Incorporation of ABL-targeted oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into frontline therapeutic regimens has improved outcomes for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL). However, patients with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) exhibit increased risk of relapse. Combining consolidative chemotherapy with TKIs may increase rates of infectious complications, organ toxicity, hospitalization, and non-relapse mortality. Blinatumomab has demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with relapsed B-ALL or persistent MRD, including Ph + B-ALL. We have used blinatumomab concomitantly with commercially available TKIs as consolidative therapy to spare toxicities of conventional chemotherapy. We evaluated 11 adults with previously treated Ph + B-ALL who received blinatumomab concurrent with TKI (ponatinib, n = 5; dasatinib, n = 4; nilotinib, n = 1; imatinib, n = 1) to eradicate MRD or sustain MRD-negativity. Eight of 9 patients with MRD achieved BCR-ABL1 negativity (complete molecular response, CMR) after a median of one cycle; 2/2 patients without measurable disease durably maintained CMR. Cytokine release syndrome (all grade 1-2) was observed in 3/11 patients; one patient experienced transient grade 1 neurologic toxicity. Transient grade 2 transaminitis was observed in 6/11 patients, including 4/5 recipients of blinatumomab + ponatinib.

The relationship of child executive functions to parenting capacities in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2019-04-29,"The current study examined associations between child executive functions and parenting capacities in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Participants included 188 parent-child dyads; children were at least 8 years of age, 5 years postdiagnosis of ALL, and previously treated with chemotherapy only. Parents completed the Parental Protection Scale (PPS), Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS), and Decision-Making Questionnaire (DMQ). Children completed measures of executive functioning and general cognitive abilities. Multivariate multiple regression examined associations between child executive functioning and parenting, while controlling for child age, treatment risk, maternal education, and child intelligence quotient. An exploratory aim identified latent profiles of parenting capacities. Higher child cognitive flexibility (β = -0.16, P = .02) and planning abilities (β = -0.16, P = .049) were related to less parental overprotection. No other neurocognitive measures were related to child autonomy in decision making or perceived child vulnerability. For the exploratory aim, we found (a) a large class defined by normative parenting (94.3%) and (b) a small class characterized by higher levels of child vulnerability and overprotection. Class membership was unrelated to executive functioning, but higher maternal education was related to higher odds of class 2 membership (OR = 0.58, P = .04). Results suggest that parents respond to child executive function difficulties with greater overprotection, which may be adaptive but not conducive to the development of independence. Although most parents report normative levels of child vulnerability and overprotection, a small subset demonstrate parenting practices that may place some survivors at risk for adverse outcomes.",Journal Article,267.0,0.0,current examined associations child executive functions parenting capacities long-term survivors childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Participants included 188 parent-child dyads children 8 years age 5 years postdiagnosis previously treated chemotherapy Parents completed Parental Protection Scale PPS Child Vulnerability Scale CVS Decision-Making Questionnaire DMQ Children completed measures executive functioning general cognitive abilities Multivariate multiple regression examined associations child executive functioning parenting controlling child age treatment risk maternal education child intelligence quotient exploratory aim identified latent profiles parenting capacities Higher child cognitive flexibility -0.16 P .02 planning abilities -0.16 P .049 related parental overprotection neurocognitive measures related child autonomy decision making perceived child vulnerability exploratory aim large class defined normative parenting 94.3 b small class characterized higher levels child vulnerability overprotection Class membership unrelated executive functioning higher maternal education related higher odds class 2 membership 0.58 P .04 suggest parents respond child executive function difficulties greater overprotection adaptive conducive development independence parents report normative levels child vulnerability overprotection small subset demonstrate parenting practices place survivors risk adverse outcomes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 291, 45, 409, 685, 59, 2566, 6481, 1681, 2, 30040, 14866, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 864, 286, 1275, 62, 776, 159, 5664, 3841, 2566, 10003, 541, 11, 28, 506, 66, 60, 1, 89, 33, 60, 7163, 1, 62, 2, 373, 73, 5, 56, 158, 2418, 781, 3, 3418, 3525, 1124, 10513, 2566, 7665, 1124, 14723, 2, 948, 1079, 1770, 74735, 541, 781, 1018, 1, 6481, 2702, 2, 1083, 1863, 7965, 331, 232, 320, 409, 685, 59, 2566, 6481, 2702, 2, 30040, 369, 1893, 9, 2566, 89, 24, 43, 6039, 1848, 2, 2566, 9125, 15164, 35, 2386, 1130, 108, 6011, 1241, 1, 30040, 14866, 142, 2566, 1863, 9794, 13, 245, 19, 588, 2, 1349, 7965, 13, 245, 19, 5121, 11, 139, 6, 299, 3418, 23009, 77, 127, 2958, 1018, 11, 139, 6, 2566, 14086, 4, 948, 1079, 15, 2588, 2566, 7665, 9, 3, 2386, 1130, 21, 204, 8, 8, 375, 1040, 395, 20, 9658, 30040, 960, 27, 2, 132, 8, 302, 1040, 765, 20, 142, 148, 1, 2566, 7665, 2, 23009, 1040, 9592, 10, 2092, 6, 6481, 2702, 84, 142, 6039, 1848, 10, 139, 6, 142, 610, 1, 1040, 18, 9592, 15, 13, 717, 19, 755, 99, 309, 17, 2418, 1892, 6, 2566, 6481, 343, 4679, 5, 378, 23009, 92, 68, 40, 2454, 84, 44, 16774, 6, 3, 193, 1, 5773, 242, 96, 2418, 414, 9658, 148, 1, 2566, 7665, 2, 23009, 8, 302, 697, 608, 30040, 2634, 17, 68, 3536, 476, 332, 28, 43, 9, 290, 123]",1740.0,31033172,relationship child executive functions parenting capacities childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors,0,0.0
Demographics and Outcome of Philadelphia-positive ALL in a Pediatric Population in North India: a Single-center Experience.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol.

We have evaluated the demographics and outcome of Ph+ ALL patients treated with imatinib without blood marrow transplantation. Of the 206 children with ALL registered for treatment, the demographic data of 15 Ph+ ALL patients were compared with the remaining Ph- patients. Imatinib (340 mg/m) was started on day 5 (D5) of induction in Ph+ patients, and their overall survival was compared with Ph- high-risk patients treated on similar protocols. Statistical analysis was carried out by the Fisher exact test and the t test. The Kaplan-Meier test was used for survival analysis. Philadelphia positivity noted in 15/206 (7.28%) ALL patients was higher than reported earlier. Median initial total leukocyte count and central nervous system positivity were significantly higher in Ph+ patients. Myeloid markers, CD13 and CD33, were also positive in 33.3% Ph+ patients. D15 and D35 marrow showed remissions in a larger proportion of Ph+ ALL, as compared with Ph- patients, but chemotherapy interruptions and neutropenic deaths were significantly higher after starting imatinib, as compared with Philadelphia high-risk patients. Overall survival was similar in Ph+ and Ph- high-risk ALL patients. Ph+ ALL, noted in 7.28%, presented with high initial white blood cell counts, high central nervous system positivity, poor steroid response, and higher induction deaths, as compared with high-risk Ph- ALL, and raised the question about the appropriate dose and time of introduction of imatinib to prevent toxicity.",Journal Article,204.0,0.0,Philadelphia-positive Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia children worse outcome use tyrosine kinase inhibitors evaluated demographics outcome Ph+ patients treated imatinib blood marrow transplantation 206 children registered treatment demographic 15 Ph+ patients compared remaining Ph- patients Imatinib 340 mg/m started day 5 D5 induction Ph+ patients overall survival compared Ph- high-risk patients treated similar protocols Statistical carried Fisher exact test test Kaplan-Meier test survival Philadelphia positivity noted 15/206 7.28 patients higher reported earlier Median initial total leukocyte count central nervous positivity significantly higher Ph+ patients Myeloid markers CD13 CD33 positive 33.3 Ph+ patients D15 D35 marrow showed remissions larger proportion Ph+ compared Ph- patients chemotherapy interruptions neutropenic deaths significantly higher starting imatinib compared Philadelphia high-risk patients Overall survival similar Ph+ Ph- high-risk patients Ph+ noted 7.28 presented high initial white blood counts high central nervous positivity poor steroid response higher induction deaths compared high-risk Ph- raised question appropriate dose time introduction imatinib prevent toxicity,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3006, 109, 2058, 286, 1275, 62, 4, 541, 42, 8, 639, 228, 348, 3, 119, 1, 564, 216, 222, 21, 47, 194, 3, 2221, 2, 228, 1, 2058, 62, 7, 73, 5, 577, 187, 315, 581, 497, 1, 3, 5956, 541, 5, 62, 1653, 9, 24, 3, 1540, 74, 1, 167, 2058, 62, 7, 11, 72, 5, 3, 1844, 2058, 7, 577, 7264, 81, 188, 10, 3461, 23, 218, 33, 19576, 1, 504, 4, 2058, 7, 2, 136, 63, 25, 10, 72, 5, 2058, 64, 43, 7, 73, 23, 288, 2189, 1050, 65, 10, 2629, 1205, 20, 3, 3135, 2472, 412, 2, 3, 102, 412, 3, 876, 882, 412, 10, 95, 9, 25, 65, 3006, 1887, 1051, 4, 167, 5956, 67, 339, 62, 7, 10, 142, 76, 210, 1677, 52, 388, 181, 3627, 1276, 2, 854, 1880, 398, 1887, 11, 97, 142, 4, 2058, 7, 533, 525, 13518, 2, 6353, 11, 120, 109, 4, 466, 27, 2058, 7, 25318, 2, 74736, 581, 224, 3166, 4, 8, 1077, 920, 1, 2058, 62, 22, 72, 5, 2058, 7, 84, 56, 7406, 2, 3659, 1043, 11, 97, 142, 50, 1723, 577, 22, 72, 5, 3006, 64, 43, 7, 63, 25, 10, 288, 4, 2058, 2, 2058, 64, 43, 62, 7, 2058, 62, 1051, 4, 67, 339, 917, 5, 64, 388, 886, 315, 31, 1911, 64, 854, 1880, 398, 1887, 334, 3853, 51, 2, 142, 504, 1043, 22, 72, 5, 64, 43, 2058, 62, 2, 5673, 3, 2840, 545, 3, 870, 61, 2, 98, 1, 2456, 1, 577, 6, 1682, 155]",1599.0,31033785,Demographics Outcome Philadelphia-positive Pediatric Population North India Single-center Experience,55,0.060109289617486336

The changing burden of long-term health outcomes in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a retrospective analysis of the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study.,The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2019-05-08,"Treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia has evolved over the past five decades, with moderation of traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the introduction of targeted immune-based and cellular-based therapies. The affect of these changes on late health outcomes has not been assessed. Using data from the The St Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) Cohort, we aimed to characterise the magnitude of morbidity and patterns of late health outcomes among survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated over time. The St Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) Cohort is a retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up and ongoing data accrual designed to facilitate longitudinal, clinically-based assessment of health outcomes among survivors of paediatric malignancies. 980 survivors included in this analysis were diagnosed with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) between Aug 28, 1963, and July 19, 2003, were aged 18 years old and older at enrolment, had a minimum follow-up of 10 years after diagnosis, and completed an initial on-campus SJLIFE assessment as of data cutoff (June 30, 2015). 272 community control participants, matched to survivors on 5-year age blocks in each sex, were recruited for comparison. Cumulative chemotherapy and radiation dose exposures and major medical events during and after therapy were retrieved from the medical records of the survivors. History or physical examination, laboratory analysis, physical fitness, and neurocognitive testing were done. Health conditions were graded according to a modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Neurocognitive domains of attention (Trial Making Test Part A and Conner's Continuous Performance Test-II) and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Digit Span Test Backward) were measured and age-adjusted Z scores were calculated. Mean cumulative count was used to calculate the age-standardised cumulative burden of health conditions over time. This cohort study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00760656. 980 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (50% women, median age at diagnosis 5 years [IQR 3·1-9·1 years], and median time from diagnosis of 30·0 years [22·7-36·3]) had a median age of 35·8 years (29·4-42·9) at assessment compared with 35·1 years (28·7-42·6) for 272 controls. Survivors had significantly more growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, and neuropathy than controls. By age 30 years, survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had, on average, 5·4 (95% CI 5·1-5·8) grade 1-4 health conditions, including 3·2 (2·9-3·4) grade 2-4 health conditions, compared with 2·0 (CI 1·7-2·2) grade 1-4 and 1·2 (1·03-1·4) grade 2-4 health conditions among controls. The cumulative burden of grade 2-4 health conditions involved multiple organ systems for survivors treated on protocols between 1962-91, but after elimination of cranial radiotherapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, conditions now predominately include musculoskeletal and endocrine disorders for survivors on protocols between 1991-2007. Although changes in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment protocols have improved overall survival, the burden of late morbidity remains high for these patients. We show that the pattern of late toxic effects has markedly changed over time, with survivors having a reduction in health conditions that are immediately life-threatening, however, maintaining health status and quality of life for survivors of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia requires continued medical surveillance, counselling, and lifestyle modifications.

Convergent genetic aberrations in murine and human T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias.,PLoS genetics,PLoS Genet.,2019-06-14,"The lack of predictive preclinical models is a fundamental barrier to translating knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis of cancer into improved therapies. Insertional mutagenesis (IM) in mice is a robust strategy for generating malignancies that recapitulate the extensive inter- and intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity found in advanced human cancers. While the central role of ""driver"" viral insertions in IM models that aberrantly increase the expression of proto-oncogenes or disrupt tumor suppressors has been appreciated for many years, the contributions of cooperating somatic mutations and large chromosomal alterations to tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Integrated genomic studies of T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) generated by IM in wild-type (WT) and Kras mutant mice reveal frequent point mutations and other recurrent non-insertional genetic alterations that also occur in human T-ALL. These somatic mutations are sensitive and specific markers for defining clonal dynamics and identifying candidate resistance mechanisms in leukemias that relapse after an initial therapeutic response. Primary cancers initiated by IM and resistant clones that emerge during in vivo treatment close key gaps in existing preclinical models, and are robust platforms for investigating the efficacy of new therapies and for elucidating how drug exposure shapes tumor evolution and patterns of resistance.",Journal Article,221.0,0.0,lack predictive preclinical models fundamental barrier translating knowledge molecular pathogenesis improved therapies Insertional mutagenesis IM mice robust strategy generating malignancies recapitulate extensive inter- intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity advanced human central role `` driver '' viral insertions IM models aberrantly increase expression proto-oncogenes disrupt suppressors appreciated years contributions cooperating somatic large chromosomal alterations tumorigenesis largely unknown Integrated genomic studies lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias T-ALLs generated IM wild-type WT Kras mice reveal frequent point recurrent non-insertional genetic alterations occur human T-ALL somatic sensitive specific markers defining clonal dynamics identifying candidate resistance mechanisms leukemias relapse initial therapeutic response Primary initiated IM resistant clones emerge vivo treatment close key gaps existing preclinical models robust platforms investigating efficacy new therapies elucidating drug exposure shapes evolution patterns resistance,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 926, 1, 464, 693, 274, 16, 8, 4595, 3318, 6, 8446, 922, 545, 3, 219, 1384, 1, 12, 237, 231, 235, 23271, 8595, 2820, 4, 399, 16, 8, 1922, 692, 9, 3997, 441, 17, 7746, 3, 1344, 3606, 2, 2392, 4204, 336, 1144, 204, 4, 131, 171, 163, 369, 3, 854, 200, 1, 2228, 522, 1667, 6315, 4, 2820, 274, 17, 5619, 344, 3, 55, 1, 4976, 3326, 15, 6619, 30, 5704, 71, 85, 7292, 9, 445, 60, 3, 5621, 1, 11413, 1119, 138, 2, 375, 1860, 593, 6, 1565, 32, 1733, 860, 2102, 572, 94, 1, 102, 2542, 286, 1275, 2792, 102, 10706, 1419, 20, 2820, 4, 955, 267, 1820, 2, 723, 620, 399, 2396, 908, 741, 138, 2, 127, 387, 220, 23271, 336, 593, 17, 120, 1271, 4, 171, 102, 62, 46, 1119, 138, 32, 745, 2, 112, 525, 9, 2847, 1946, 5193, 2, 1386, 1609, 251, 483, 4, 2792, 17, 429, 50, 35, 388, 189, 51, 86, 163, 1917, 20, 2820, 2, 436, 2749, 17, 6371, 190, 4, 386, 24, 2336, 825, 5287, 4, 1692, 693, 274, 2, 32, 1922, 4364, 9, 3103, 3, 209, 1, 217, 235, 2, 9, 7980, 832, 234, 645, 14475, 30, 2554, 2, 764, 1, 251]",1414.0,31199785,Convergent genetic aberrations murine human lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias,630,0.6885245901639344
The magnitude and predictors of abandonment of therapy in paediatric acute leukaemia in middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2013-04-15,"Abandonment of therapy is a significant cause of paediatric cancer treatment failure in low- to middle-income countries (LMIC), but its impact has been underestimated. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of abandonment in paediatric leukaemia in LMIC and sought to identify patient-, centre- and country-specific predictors of abandonment. We searched seven databases to identify paediatric oncology cohorts followed up from diagnosis and treated in LMIC. All languages were included. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data. Authors were contacted for additional information. Subgroup analyses were planned a priori. Of 22,384 publications, 318 in eight languages met criteria for full text review. 157 studies met analysis inclusion criteria. Abandonment rates (ARs), obtained for 83 of the 157 studies (52.9%), ranged from 0% to 74.5%. ARs were frequently unreported and available only directly from authors. Forty studies (10,494 children in 20 countries) were quantitatively analysed. ARs for acute lymphoblastic laeukemia in lower-middle-income countries (lower-MICs) were higher than in upper-middle-income countries (29%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23-36% versus 2%, 95% CI 1-3%; p<0.0001) but were heterogeneous (I(2)=98%; p<0.0001). This heterogeneity was not explained by centre-specific (free versus paid treatment) or country-specific (government health expenditure, per-capital income) subgroups. In LMICs, ARs are highest in lower-MICs. However, their broad range suggests that low ARs are possible in resource-constrained settings. Analysis of outliers may suggest interventions for use at other centres. Methodologically appropriate reporting of ARs should be adopted. Future research should evaluate interventions targeting abandonment.",Journal Article,2472.0,,"Abandonment therapy significant cause paediatric treatment failure low- middle-income countries LMIC impact underestimated performed meta-analysis determine magnitude abandonment paediatric leukaemia LMIC sought identify patient- centre- country-specific predictors abandonment searched seven databases identify paediatric oncology cohorts followed diagnosis treated LMIC languages included reviewers independently selected articles extracted Authors contacted additional information Subgroup planned priori 22,384 publications 318 languages met criteria text review 157 studies met inclusion criteria Abandonment rates ARs obtained 83 157 studies 52.9 ranged 0 74.5 ARs frequently unreported available directly authors studies 10,494 children 20 countries quantitatively analysed ARs acute lymphoblastic laeukemia lower-middle-income countries lower-MICs higher upper-middle-income countries 29 95 confidence interval CI 23-36 versus 2 95 CI 1-3 p 0.0001 heterogeneous 2 =98 p 0.0001 heterogeneity explained centre-specific free versus paid treatment country-specific government health expenditure per-capital income subgroups LMICs ARs highest lower-MICs broad range suggests low ARs possible resource-constrained settings outliers suggest interventions use centres Methodologically appropriate reporting ARs adopted Future research evaluate interventions targeting abandonment",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[9839, 1, 36, 16, 8, 93, 708, 1, 6138, 12, 24, 496, 4, 154, 6, 3897, 2306, 2115, 12950, 84, 211, 345, 71, 85, 10585, 21, 173, 8, 1742, 65, 6, 223, 3, 3131, 1, 9839, 4, 6138, 2001, 4, 12950, 2, 990, 6, 255, 69, 5931, 2, 5978, 112, 674, 1, 9839, 21, 3080, 648, 2348, 6, 255, 6138, 413, 736, 370, 126, 29, 147, 2, 73, 4, 12950, 62, 24312, 11, 159, 100, 7171, 1042, 715, 2384, 2, 2484, 74, 738, 11, 8590, 9, 402, 487, 1363, 318, 11, 1465, 8, 7499, 1, 350, 12612, 4463, 8797, 4, 659, 24312, 543, 371, 9, 1647, 6153, 206, 5311, 94, 543, 65, 1680, 371, 9839, 151, 9381, 683, 9, 852, 1, 3, 5311, 94, 653, 83, 1869, 29, 13, 6, 794, 33, 9381, 11, 746, 10046, 2, 390, 158, 1606, 29, 738, 1213, 94, 79, 10919, 541, 4, 179, 2115, 11, 5889, 3141, 9381, 9, 286, 1275, 77257, 4, 280, 3897, 2306, 2115, 280, 32278, 11, 142, 76, 4, 1726, 3897, 2306, 2115, 462, 48, 307, 268, 58, 382, 511, 185, 18, 48, 58, 14, 27, 19, 13, 488, 84, 11, 1564, 70, 18, 1096, 19, 13, 488, 26, 1144, 10, 44, 3672, 20, 5931, 112, 115, 185, 8328, 24, 15, 5978, 112, 7608, 341, 8699, 379, 17386, 2306, 1453, 4, 13457, 9381, 32, 1076, 4, 280, 32278, 137, 136, 2094, 184, 844, 17, 154, 9381, 32, 899, 4, 3069, 9133, 1947, 65, 1, 13137, 68, 309, 1151, 9, 119, 28, 127, 4496, 31554, 870, 1760, 1, 9381, 257, 40, 4457, 508, 389, 257, 376, 1151, 529, 9839]",,23597721,magnitude predictors abandonment therapy paediatric acute leukaemia middle-income countries systematic review meta-analysis,0,0.0

Risk of late effects of treatment in children newly diagnosed with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2014-06-19,"Treatment of patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has evolved such that the risk of late effects in survivors treated in accordance with contemporary protocols could be different from that noted in those treated decades ago. We aimed to estimate the risk of late effects in children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with contemporary protocols. We used data from similarly treated members of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a multicentre, North American study of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. We included cohort members if they were aged 1·0-9·9 years at the time of diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and had received treatment consistent with contemporary standard-risk protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We calculated mortality rates and standardised mortality ratios, stratified by sex and survival time, after diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We calculated standardised incidence ratios and absolute excess risk for subsequent neoplasms with age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar-year-specific rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Outcomes were compared with a sibling cohort and the general US population. We included 556 (13%) of 4329 cohort members treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Median follow-up of the survivors from 5 years after diagnosis was 18·4 years (range 0·0-33·0). 28 (5%) of 556 participants had died (standardised mortality ratio 3·5, 95% CI 2·3-5·0). 16 (57%) deaths were due to causes other than recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Six (1%) survivors developed a subsequent malignant neoplasm (standardised incidence ratio 2·6, 95% CI 1·0-5·7). 107 participants (95% CI 81-193) in each group would need to be followed-up for 1 year to observe one extra chronic health disorder in the survivor group compared with the sibling group. 415 participants (376-939) in each group would need to be followed-up for 1 year to observe one extra severe, life-threatening, or fatal disorder in the group of survivors.

Loss of oncogenic Notch1 with resistance to a PI3K inhibitor in T-cell leukaemia.,Nature,Nature,2014-07-20,"Mutations that deregulate Notch1 and Ras/phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling are prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), and often coexist. Here we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 is active against primary T-ALLs from wild-type and Kras(G12D) mice, and addition of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 increases its efficacy. Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling. These studies validate PI3K as a therapeutic target in T-ALL and raise the unexpected possibility that dual inhibition of PI3K and Notch1 signalling could promote drug resistance in T-ALL.

Targeting transcription regulation in cancer with a covalent CDK7 inhibitor.,Nature,Nature,2014-06-22,"Tumour oncogenes include transcription factors that co-opt the general transcriptional machinery to sustain the oncogenic state, but direct pharmacological inhibition of transcription factors has so far proven difficult. However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic cofactors that can be targeted for the development of new therapeutic candidates, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Here we present the discovery and characterization of a covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented ability to target a remote cysteine residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of achieving selectivity for CDK7. Cancer cell-line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell lines, including human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have exceptional sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat T-ALL cells shows that THZ1 disproportionally affects transcription of RUNX1 and suggests that sensitivity to THZ1 may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and the key role of RUNX1 in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these tumour cells. Pharmacological modulation of CDK7 kinase activity may thus provide an approach to identify and treat tumour types that are dependent on transcription for maintenance of the oncogenic state.

Targeting oncogenic interleukin-7 receptor signalling with N-acetylcysteine in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2014-09-26,"Activating mutations of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R) occur in approximately 10% of patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Most mutations generate a cysteine at the transmembrane domain leading to receptor homodimerization through disulfide bond formation and ligand-independent activation of STAT5. We hypothesized that the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-tolerated drug used widely in clinical practice to treat acetaminophen overdose, would reduce disulfide bond formation, and inhibit mutant IL7R-mediated oncogenic signalling. We found that treatment with NAC disrupted IL7R homodimerization in IL7R-mutant DND-41 cells as assessed by non-reducing Western blot, as well as in a luciferase complementation assay. NAC led to STAT5 dephosphorylation and cell apoptosis at clinically achievable concentrations in DND-41 cells, and Ba/F3 cells transformed by an IL7R-mutant construct containing a cysteine insertion. The apoptotic effects of NAC could be rescued in part by a constitutively active allele of STAT5. Despite using doses lower than those tolerated in humans, NAC treatment significantly inhibited the progression of human DND-41 cells engrafted in immunodeficient mice. Thus, targeting leukaemogenic IL7R homodimerization with NAC offers a potentially effective and feasible therapeutic strategy that warrants testing in patients with T-ALL.

Rise and fall of subclones from diagnosis to relapse in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2015-03-19,"There is incomplete understanding of genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution during cancer progression. Here we use deep whole-exome sequencing to describe the clonal architecture and evolution of 20 pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias from diagnosis to relapse. We show that clonal diversity is comparable at diagnosis and relapse and clonal survival from diagnosis to relapse is not associated with mutation burden. Six pathways were frequently mutated, with NT5C2, CREBBP, WHSC1, TP53, USH2A, NRAS and IKZF1 mutations enriched at relapse. Half of the leukaemias had multiple subclonal mutations in a pathway or gene at diagnosis, but mostly with only one, usually minor clone, surviving therapy to acquire additional mutations and become the relapse founder clone.

A variant at 9p21.3 functionally implicates CDKN2B in paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia aetiology.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2016-02-12,"Paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common cancer of childhood, yet little is known about BCP-ALL predisposition. In this study, in 2,187 cases of European ancestry and 5,543 controls, we discover and replicate a locus indexed by rs77728904 at 9p21.3 associated with BCP-ALL susceptibility (Pcombined=3.32 × 10(-15), OR=1.72) and independent from rs3731217, the previously reported ALL-associated variant in this region. Of correlated SNPs tagged by this locus, only rs662463 is significant in African Americans, suggesting it is a plausible causative variant. Functional analysis shows that rs662463 is a cis-eQTL for CDKN2B, with the risk allele associated with lower expression, and suggests that rs662463 influences BCP-ALL risk by regulating CDKN2B expression through CEBPB signalling. Functional analysis of rs3731217 suggests it is associated with BCP-ALL by acting within a splicing regulatory element determining CDKN2A exon 3 usage (P=0.01). These findings provide new insights into the critical role of the CDKN2 locus in BCP-ALL aetiology.

Consensus definitions of 14 severe acute toxic effects for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment: a Delphi consensus.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-06-01,"Although there are high survival rates for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, their outcome is often counterbalanced by the burden of toxic effects. This is because reported frequencies vary widely across studies, partly because of diverse definitions of toxic effects. Using the Delphi method, 15 international childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia study groups assessed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols to address toxic effects that were to be considered by the Ponte di Legno working group. 14 acute toxic effects (hypersensitivity to asparaginase, hyperlipidaemia, osteonecrosis, asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, seizures, depressed level of consciousness, methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, high-dose methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, thromboembolism, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) that are serious but too rare to be addressed comprehensively within any single group, or are deemed to need consensus definitions for reliable incidence comparisons, were selected for assessment. Our results showed that none of the protocols addressed all 14 toxic effects, that no two protocols shared identical definitions of all toxic effects, and that no toxic effect definition was shared by all protocols. Using the Delphi method over three face-to-face plenary meetings, consensus definitions were obtained for all 14 toxic effects. In the overall assessment of outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment, these expert opinion-based definitions will allow reliable comparisons of frequencies and severities of acute toxic effects across treatment protocols, and facilitate international research on cause, guidelines for treatment adaptation, preventive strategies, and development of consensus algorithms for reporting on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment.",Journal Article,1329.0,62.0,high survival rates children acute lymphoblastic leukaemia outcome counterbalanced burden toxic effects reported frequencies vary widely studies partly diverse definitions toxic effects Delphi 15 international childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia groups assessed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols address toxic effects considered Ponte di Legno working group 14 acute toxic effects hypersensitivity asparaginase hyperlipidaemia osteonecrosis asparaginase-associated pancreatitis arterial hypertension posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome seizures depressed level consciousness methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome peripheral neuropathy high-dose methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity sinusoidal obstructive syndrome thromboembolism Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia rare addressed comprehensively single group deemed need consensus definitions reliable incidence comparisons selected assessment showed protocols addressed 14 toxic effects protocols shared identical definitions toxic effects toxic effect definition shared protocols Delphi face-to-face plenary meetings consensus definitions obtained 14 toxic effects overall assessment outcome acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment expert opinion-based definitions allow reliable comparisons frequencies severities acute toxic effects treatment protocols facilitate international research cause guidelines treatment adaptation preventive strategies development consensus algorithms reporting acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 125, 32, 64, 25, 151, 9, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 2001, 136, 228, 16, 629, 22111, 20, 3, 892, 1, 1812, 176, 26, 16, 408, 210, 2722, 2825, 1792, 716, 94, 5180, 408, 1, 1867, 3833, 1, 1812, 176, 75, 3, 6803, 596, 167, 944, 864, 286, 1275, 2001, 45, 271, 275, 286, 1275, 2001, 2189, 6, 1539, 1812, 176, 17, 11, 6, 40, 515, 20, 3, 78485, 6641, 78486, 2644, 87, 213, 286, 1812, 176, 4034, 6, 3709, 78487, 5404, 3709, 41, 4535, 3127, 1824, 3028, 2786, 9954, 681, 4448, 9233, 301, 1, 15471, 2116, 139, 4408, 733, 681, 672, 1751, 64, 61, 2116, 139, 10682, 9820, 6937, 681, 3501, 2, 13243, 36277, 3485, 17, 32, 1762, 84, 5044, 622, 6, 40, 2814, 5627, 262, 500, 226, 87, 15, 32, 3779, 6, 594, 1391, 3833, 9, 2450, 287, 2213, 11, 715, 9, 455, 114, 99, 224, 17, 1292, 1, 3, 2189, 2814, 62, 213, 1812, 176, 17, 77, 100, 2189, 2664, 3038, 3833, 1, 62, 1812, 176, 2, 17, 77, 1812, 254, 2470, 10, 2664, 20, 62, 2189, 75, 3, 6803, 596, 252, 169, 3376, 6, 3376, 21469, 6941, 1391, 3833, 11, 683, 9, 62, 213, 1812, 176, 4, 3, 63, 455, 1, 228, 1, 286, 1275, 2001, 24, 46, 2005, 3564, 90, 3833, 303, 1700, 2450, 2213, 1, 2722, 2, 37703, 1, 286, 1812, 176, 716, 24, 2189, 2, 1876, 944, 389, 23, 708, 677, 9, 24, 7275, 3494, 422, 2, 193, 1, 1391, 3529, 9, 1760, 23, 286, 1275, 2001, 24]",,27299279,Consensus definitions 14 severe acute toxic effects childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment Delphi consensus,0,0.0
"Cognitive, behaviour, and academic functioning in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.",The lancet. Psychiatry,Lancet Psychiatry,2016-09-14,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive deficits that affect development in adolescence and young adulthood, and influence educational attainment and future independence. We examined a large and diverse cohort of survivors to identify risk predictors and modifiers of these outcomes. In this cohort study, cognitive and behaviour symptoms were assessed via a standardised parent questionnaire for 1560 adolescent survivors of ALL diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. Clinically significant symptoms (≥90th percentile) and learning problems were compared between survivors and a sibling cohort. Multivariable regression models were used to examine associations with demographic and treatment characteristics. Models were adjusted for inverse probability of sampling weights to reflect undersampling of ALL survivors in the expansion cohort. In a subset of survivors with longitudinal data (n=925), we examined associations between adolescent symptoms or problems and adult educational attainment. Compared with siblings, survivors treated with chemotherapy only were more likely to demonstrate headstrong behaviour (155 [19%] of 752 survivors vs 88 [14%] of 610 siblings, p=0·010), inattention-hyperactivity (15 [19%] vs 86 [14%], p<0·0001), social withdrawal (142 [18%] vs 75 [12%], p=0·002), and had higher rates of learning problems (191 [28%] vs 76 [14%], p<0·0001). In multivariable models among survivors, increased cumulative dose of intravenous methotrexate (ie, >4·3 g/m<sup>2</sup>) conferred increased risk of inattention-hyperactivity (relative risk [RR] 1·53, 95% CI 1·13-2·08). Adolescent survivors with cognitive or behaviour problems and those with learning problems were less likely to graduate from college as young adults than adolescent survivors without cognitive or behaviour problems. Although modern therapy for childhood ALL has eliminated the use of cranial radiation therapy, adolescent survivors treated with chemotherapy only remain at increased risk for cognitive, behaviour, and academic problems that adversely affect adult education outcomes.

NT5C2 germline variants alter thiopurine metabolism and are associated with acquired NT5C2 relapse mutations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-09-10,"The antileukaemic drug 6-mercaptopurine is converted into thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and incorporated into DNA (DNA-TG), the active end metabolite. In a series of genome-wide association studies, we analysed time-weighted means (<sub>wm</sub>) of erythrocyte concentrations of TGN (Ery-TGN) and DNA-TG in 1009 patients undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In discovery analyses (454 patients), the propensity for DNA-TG incorporation (<sub>wm</sub>DNA-TG/<sub>wm</sub>Ery-TGN ratio) was significantly associated with three intronic SNPs in NT5C2 (top hit: rs72846714; P = 2.09 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, minor allele frequency 15%). In validation analyses (555 patients), this association remained significant during both early and late maintenance therapy (P = 8.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and 1.3 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, respectively).

Genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in children treated according to NOPHO ALL2008.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2018-11-18,"Asparaginase is essential in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treatment, however hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) hampers anti-neoplastic efficacy. Patients with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity have been shown to possess zero asparaginase enzyme activity. Using this measurement to define the phenotype, we investigated genetic predisposition to PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). From July 2008 to March 2016, 1494 children were treated on the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol. Cases were defined by clinical hypersensitivity and no enzyme activity, controls had enzyme activity ≥ 100 iu/l and no hypersensitivity symptoms. PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity was reported in 13·8% (206/1494) of patients. Fifty-nine cases and 772 controls fulfilled GWAS inclusion criteria. The CNOT3 variant rs73062673 on 19q13.42, was associated with PEG-asparaginase allergy (P = 4·68 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ). We further identified two signals on chromosome 6 in relation to HLA-DQA1 (P = 9·37 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ) and TAP2 (P = 1·59 × 10<sup>-5</sup> ). This study associated variants in CNOT3 and in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region with PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity, suggesting that not only genetic variations in the HLA region, but also regulation of these genes are of importance in the biology of this toxicity. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of using asparaginase enzyme activity measurements to identify PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity.",Clinical Trial,429.0,2.0,Asparaginase essential childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment hypersensitivity reactions pegylated asparaginase PEG-asparaginase hampers anti-neoplastic efficacy Patients PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity shown possess zero asparaginase enzyme activity measurement define phenotype investigated genetic predisposition PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity genome-wide association GWAS July 2008 March 2016 1494 children treated Nordic Society Paediatric Haematology Oncology ALL2008 protocol Cases defined clinical hypersensitivity enzyme activity controls enzyme activity ≥ 100 iu/l hypersensitivity symptoms PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity reported 13·8 206/1494 patients Fifty-nine cases 772 controls fulfilled GWAS inclusion criteria CNOT3 rs73062673 19q13.42 associated PEG-asparaginase allergy P 4·68 10 sup -8 /sup identified signals chromosome 6 relation HLA-DQA1 P 9·37 10 sup -6 /sup TAP2 P 1·59 10 sup -5 /sup associated CNOT3 human leucocyte antigen HLA region PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity suggesting genetic variations HLA region regulation importance toxicity Furthermore emphasizes importance asparaginase enzyme activity measurements identify PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3709, 16, 1452, 4, 864, 286, 1275, 2001, 62, 24, 137, 4034, 2428, 6, 4424, 3709, 3145, 3709, 20513, 312, 2000, 209, 7, 5, 3145, 3709, 4034, 47, 85, 443, 6, 5766, 5115, 3709, 1644, 128, 75, 26, 2204, 6, 1107, 3, 1005, 21, 565, 336, 2863, 6, 3145, 3709, 4034, 4, 8, 898, 1019, 248, 45, 3297, 29, 2066, 1375, 6, 2363, 1390, 17794, 541, 11, 73, 23, 3, 20680, 1174, 1, 6138, 32502, 2, 413, 79815, 1182, 140, 11, 395, 20, 38, 4034, 2, 77, 1644, 128, 535, 42, 1644, 128, 749, 394, 4588, 805, 2, 77, 4034, 507, 3145, 3709, 4034, 10, 210, 4, 18674, 5956, 17794, 1, 7, 1461, 762, 140, 2, 15258, 535, 9091, 3297, 1680, 371, 3, 20101, 1142, 79816, 23, 14746, 595, 10, 41, 5, 3145, 3709, 9842, 19, 79817, 79, 172, 66, 172, 21, 195, 108, 100, 2312, 23, 1170, 49, 4, 2191, 6, 1160, 35017, 19, 79818, 79, 172, 49, 172, 2, 29336, 19, 27309, 79, 172, 33, 172, 26, 45, 41, 839, 4, 20101, 2, 4, 3, 171, 15541, 448, 1160, 1053, 5, 3145, 3709, 4034, 802, 17, 44, 158, 336, 2293, 4, 3, 1160, 1053, 84, 120, 863, 1, 46, 214, 32, 1, 1187, 4, 3, 891, 1, 26, 155, 798, 114, 45, 7519, 3, 1187, 1, 75, 3709, 1644, 128, 1685, 6, 255, 3145, 3709, 4034]",,30450575,Genetic predisposition PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity children treated according NOPHO ALL2008,0,0.0
