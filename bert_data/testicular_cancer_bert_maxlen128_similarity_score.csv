Long-term medical care of testicular cancer survivors.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2002-03-01,"Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor diagnosed in men 20 to 35 years of age. Because of highly effective treatments that may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, most patients become long-term survivors. Health-related issues that confront testicular cancer survivors include the late medical effects of chemotherapy, the late relapse of disease, the development of second cancers, the effect of the disease and treatment on fertility, and the psychosocial consequences.

Testicular seminoma: a clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 105 cases with special reference to seminomas with atypical features.,International journal of surgical pathology,Int. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-01-01,"In spite of the high curability rates, rare cases of testicular seminoma behave in an unexpectedly aggressive manner. No effective markers are currently available that can predict such uncommon behavior. We studied 105 cases of testicular seminoma on whom the primary resection was performed at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, to investigate any relationship between morphology, immunohistochemical features, and clinical/pathological stages. Fifty-nine percent of the cases presented with pT stage 1 and 74 percent with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I. In univariate analysis, tumor size, mitotic count, and presence of necrosis showed significant associations with pT stage (p = 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.04, respectively), and the presence of vascular invasion (p = 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, both the tumor size and mitotic counts were independent predictors of pT stage (p = 0.0004 and 0.0001) and vascular invasion (p = 0.0004 and 0.0001). When tumors were separated on the basis of architectural and/or cytological atypia into ""usual seminomas"" and ""seminomas with atypia"", these were significantly associated with AJCC stage (p = 0.02), and c-kit protein (p = 0.0005) and CD30 expression (p = 0.02). In addition, ""seminomas with atypia"" also tended to show a higher proliferation activity as judged by Ki67 reactivity (p = 0.06), as well as express the marker of epithelial differentiation, Cam 5.2 (p = 0.09). In summary, we find that the morphologic features in testicular seminomas are associated with factors of clinical relevance. Also, ""seminomas with atypia"" differ from ""usual seminomas"" morphologically, present at a higher AJCC stage, and possibly represent an early step in transformation of seminomas toward a more aggressive phenotype. While not proposing a new entity, we suggest that when these atypical features are encountered in an otherwise classical seminoma, investigations must be performed to exclude an early carcinomatous differentiation or even earlier changes toward such a differentiation, such as lack of c-kit protein expression.",Journal Article,6594.0,63.0,spite high curability rates rare cases testicular seminoma behave unexpectedly aggressive manner effective markers currently available predict uncommon behavior studied 105 cases testicular seminoma primary resection performed Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center New York investigate relationship morphology immunohistochemical features clinical/pathological stages Fifty-nine percent cases presented pT stage 1 74 percent American Joint Committee AJCC stage univariate size mitotic count presence necrosis showed significant associations pT stage p 0.0001 0.0001 0.04 respectively presence vascular invasion p 0.0001 0.0001 0.02 respectively multivariate size mitotic counts independent predictors pT stage p 0.0004 0.0001 vascular invasion p 0.0004 0.0001 separated basis architectural and/or cytological atypia `` usual seminomas '' `` seminomas atypia '' significantly associated AJCC stage p 0.02 c-kit p 0.0005 CD30 expression p 0.02 addition `` seminomas atypia '' tended higher proliferation activity judged Ki67 reactivity p 0.06 express marker epithelial differentiation Cam 5.2 p 0.09 summary morphologic features testicular seminomas associated factors clinical relevance `` seminomas atypia '' differ `` usual seminomas '' morphologically present higher AJCC stage possibly represent early step transformation seminomas aggressive phenotype proposing new entity suggest atypical features encountered classical seminoma investigations performed exclude early carcinomatous differentiation earlier changes differentiation lack c-kit expression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 9018, 1, 3, 64, 10795, 151, 622, 140, 1, 6930, 10403, 4, 35, 6016, 571, 1708, 77, 323, 525, 32, 694, 390, 17, 122, 678, 225, 2052, 1710, 21, 656, 3263, 140, 1, 6930, 23, 953, 3, 86, 170, 10, 173, 28, 3, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 217, 5050, 6, 963, 500, 858, 59, 2567, 1382, 404, 2, 38, 1301, 1153, 1461, 762, 714, 1, 3, 140, 917, 5, 3395, 82, 14, 2, 794, 714, 5, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 2271, 82, 70, 4, 880, 65, 30, 444, 2346, 1276, 2, 463, 1, 1523, 224, 93, 685, 5, 3395, 82, 19, 13, 488, 13, 488, 2, 13, 755, 106, 2, 3, 463, 1, 756, 578, 19, 13, 488, 13, 488, 2, 13, 588, 106, 4, 331, 65, 110, 3, 30, 444, 2, 2346, 1911, 11, 306, 674, 1, 3395, 82, 19, 13, 5295, 2, 13, 488, 2, 756, 578, 19, 13, 5295, 2, 13, 488, 198, 57, 11, 4910, 23, 3, 877, 1, 10404, 2, 15, 9019, 3598, 237, 3521, 11092, 522, 2, 11092, 5, 3598, 522, 46, 11, 97, 41, 5, 2271, 82, 19, 13, 588, 2, 256, 1164, 178, 19, 13, 4252, 2, 4541, 55, 19, 13, 588, 4, 352, 11092, 5, 3598, 522, 120, 3886, 6, 514, 8, 142, 457, 128, 22, 7249, 20, 3654, 4601, 19, 13, 1460, 22, 149, 22, 1669, 3, 952, 1, 701, 910, 3512, 33, 18, 19, 13, 1730, 4, 1962, 21, 2469, 17, 3, 2815, 404, 4, 11092, 32, 41, 5, 130, 1, 38, 2088, 120, 11092, 5, 3598, 522, 1505, 29, 3521, 11092, 522, 6204, 364, 28, 8, 142, 2271, 82, 2, 2150, 1231, 35, 191, 2458, 4, 1392, 1, 11092, 1317, 8, 80, 571, 1005, 369, 44, 16204, 8, 217, 2983, 21, 309, 17, 198, 46, 1973, 404, 32, 3903, 4, 35, 2632, 3781, 6930, 2492, 1642, 40, 173, 6, 6262, 35, 191, 14085, 910, 15, 871, 1677, 400, 1317, 225, 8, 910, 225, 22, 926, 1, 256, 1164, 178, 55]",2053.0,11927966,Testicular seminoma clinicopathologic immunohistochemical 105 cases special reference seminomas atypical features,1,0.003389830508474576
MAGE antigen expression in monophasic and biphasic synovial sarcoma.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2002-02-01,"Synovial sarcomas are high-grade malignant mesenchymal tumors carrying a pathognomonic cytogenetic alteration t(X;18) involving the SYT gene on chromosome 18 and either SSX1 or SSX2 on chromosome X. Morphologically, biphasic (BSS) and monophasic (MSS) variants can be distinguished. Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are expressed in a variety of malignant tumors, but not in normal tissues except in germ cells, primarily of the testis. Anti-MAGE monoclonal antibody (mAb) 57B previously showed a high incidence and homogenous reactivity pattern in a preliminary analysis of synovial sarcomas. This study was performed to analyze the expression of MAGE by immunohistochemistry with mAb 57B in 25 synovial sarcomas (12 monophasic, 13 biphasic), which were typed for the t(X;18)-derived fusion transcript by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (19 SYT-SSX1, 6 SYT-SSX2). 57B immunoreactivity was present in 22 of 25 (88%) cases, and antigen expression was homogeneous in 14 of 22 57B-positive cases. Both morphological variants and both translocation types were immunoreactive; three SYT-SSX1 tumors (one MSS, two BSS) were 57B negative.

Although testicular cancer is highly treatable and curable, there are still many young men who succumb to the disease. Over the past year, important data regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of testicular cancer have been reported. The significance of genetic and molecular alterations, such as i12p and epidermal growth factor receptor expression, remain at the forefront of research. However surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are still the main treatment modalities. Attempts to limit chemotherapy and surgery while preserving cure rates are promising. The contribution of long-term platinum retention to the well-documented risk of late toxicity is unknown but provides a specific avenue for research.

Expression of SSX genes in the neoplastic cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2002-05-01,"The cancer/testis antigen (CTA) group of tumor-associated proteins have been reported to be expressed in various cancers and in adult testis but they are essentially not found in any other normal adult nonneoplastic tissues. Prompted by the frequent detection of SSX1 in a previous comprehensive expression profile of the Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) cell line L428, we analyzed SSX expression by nonnested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 4 HL cell lines (L428, L540, HD-MY-Z, and KM-H2) and 32 tumor samples of HL. The cellular localization of SSX expression in the tumor samples was further analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH). All 4 HL cell lines were positive by RT-PCR using SSX consensus primers. Using primers specific to individual SSX genes, all 4 cell lines expressed multiple SSX family members. Five tumor samples (15.6%) were positive by RT-PCR using SSX consensus primers and direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products showed that 4 of 5 expressed more than 1 SSX family member.

Multi-component behavioral intervention to promote health protective behaviors in childhood cancer survivors: the protect study.,Medical and pediatric oncology,Med. Pediatr. Oncol.,2002-07-01,"Improved cure rates for childhood cancer have produced a growing population of survivors at risk for late toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Healthy behaviors can modify these risks. We initiated a controlled prospective trial to determine if a multi-component behavioral intervention could induce change in childhood cancer survivors' health knowledge, health perceptions, and practice of health-protective behaviors. Adolescent cancer survivors attending a long-term follow-up clinic were randomized to receive standard follow-up care or standard care plus the educational intervention. Baseline measures were obtained at randomization (T(0)) and repeated 1 year (T(1)) later during the survivors' annual check-up. Of 272 patients enrolled and randomized, 251 are evaluable at both time points. Treatment and control groups were similar in regards to diagnosis, gender, race, and age. The change in outcome measures over the year (T(1)-T(0)) was not significantly different between the two groups as assessed by a two-sample pooled t test. However, additional exploratory analyses indicated a significant gender difference in knowledge with female survivors in the intervention group having higher scores. In addition, patients who choose certain individual health goals, such as breast/testicular self-examination, showed improved practice of the health behavior. In addition, in a very exploratory analysis, a gender difference in response to the intervention was noted, with females exhibiting a greater improvement in knowledge scores than did males. Although the multi-behavioral educational intervention did not induce change in health knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of childhood cancer survivors for the treatment group as a whole, gender differences and specific health goal differences were found. These findings suggest that future interventions should be tailored to reflect gender differences and the nature of the health goal under assessment.",Clinical Trial,6413.0,96.0,Improved cure rates childhood produced growing population survivors risk late toxicities chemotherapy radiation therapy Healthy behaviors modify risks initiated controlled prospective trial determine multi-component behavioral intervention induce change childhood survivors health knowledge health perceptions practice health-protective behaviors Adolescent survivors attending long-term follow-up clinic randomized receive standard follow-up care standard care plus educational intervention Baseline measures obtained randomization 0 repeated 1 year 1 later survivors annual check-up 272 patients enrolled randomized 251 evaluable time points Treatment control groups similar regards diagnosis gender race age change outcome measures year 1 -T 0 significantly different groups assessed two-sample pooled test additional exploratory indicated significant gender difference knowledge female survivors intervention group higher scores addition patients choose certain individual health goals breast/testicular self-examination showed improved practice health behavior addition exploratory gender difference response intervention noted females exhibiting greater improvement knowledge scores males multi-behavioral educational intervention induce change health knowledge perceptions behaviors childhood survivors treatment group gender differences specific health goal differences findings suggest future interventions tailored reflect gender differences nature health goal assessment,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[231, 1722, 151, 9, 864, 12, 47, 1687, 8, 1921, 266, 1, 332, 28, 43, 9, 807, 385, 1, 56, 2, 121, 36, 1331, 3704, 122, 4289, 46, 1098, 21, 1917, 8, 1149, 482, 160, 6, 223, 492, 8, 1414, 1249, 4166, 788, 359, 1290, 707, 4, 864, 12, 332, 341, 922, 341, 3746, 2, 758, 1, 341, 2864, 3704, 3678, 12, 332, 6895, 8, 319, 337, 166, 126, 1188, 11, 384, 6, 560, 260, 166, 126, 165, 15, 260, 165, 349, 3, 3624, 788, 330, 1018, 11, 683, 28, 3644, 102, 13, 2, 2113, 14, 111, 102, 14, 1559, 190, 3, 332, 2114, 9565, 126, 1, 6905, 7, 346, 2, 384, 7288, 32, 859, 28, 110, 98, 862, 24, 2, 182, 271, 11, 288, 4, 8930, 6, 147, 1632, 1047, 2, 89, 3, 707, 4, 228, 1018, 252, 3, 111, 102, 14, 102, 13, 10, 44, 97, 338, 59, 3, 100, 271, 22, 275, 20, 8, 100, 1000, 1830, 102, 412, 137, 402, 2386, 318, 1103, 8, 93, 1632, 523, 4, 922, 5, 1061, 332, 4, 3, 788, 87, 1041, 142, 703, 4, 352, 7, 54, 6009, 1840, 797, 341, 2802, 225, 22, 1678, 33267, 1074, 1385, 224, 231, 758, 1, 3, 341, 1710, 4, 352, 4, 8, 923, 2386, 65, 8, 1632, 523, 4, 51, 6, 3, 788, 10, 1051, 5, 2451, 4801, 8, 378, 767, 4, 922, 703, 76, 205, 2296, 242, 3, 1414, 4166, 3624, 788, 205, 44, 1290, 707, 4, 341, 922, 3746, 2, 3704, 1, 864, 12, 332, 9, 3, 24, 87, 22, 8, 902, 1632, 362, 2, 112, 341, 1326, 362, 11, 204, 46, 272, 309, 17, 508, 1151, 257, 40, 3632, 6, 2694, 1632, 362, 2, 3, 2202, 1, 3, 341, 1326, 669, 455]",1940.0,12116072,Multi-component behavioral intervention promote health protective behaviors childhood survivors protect,0,0.0
Low dose ketoconazole with replacement doses of hydrocortisone in patients with progressive androgen independent prostate cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2002-08-01,"High-dose (400 mg.) oral ketoconazole 3 times daily with replacement doses of hydrocortisone has become a standard treatment option for patients with advanced prostate cancer which progresses after androgen deprivation. However, toxicity can hinder the ability to deliver treatment and the cost of the regimen can be substantial. Therefore, a prospective phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of a regimen of low dose (200 mg.) oral ketoconazole 3 times daily with replacement doses of hydrocortisone in men with androgen independent prostate cancer. The study included 28 patients with progressive prostate cancer despite anorchid levels of testosterone and ongoing testicular androgen suppression. Treatment consisted of low dose ketoconazole and replacement doses of oral hydrocortisone (20 mg. every morning and 10 mg. at bedtime). At the time of disease progression patients were treated with high dose ketoconazole and continued on the same dose of hydrocortisone. Adrenal androgen levels were measured, and baseline and followup levels correlated with clinical outcome. Overall, 13 (46%) of 28 patients had a prostate specific antigen decrease of more than 50% (95% confidence interval 27.5% to 66.1%). Median duration of prostate specific antigen decrease for all responders was 30+ weeks and 5 patients continue to exhibit a response, ranging from 36+ to 53+ weeks. In general, therapy was well tolerated. There were no grade 4 toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities included hepatotoxicity in 1 patient and depression in 2. The most common toxicities were nausea (29% grades 1 and 2), dry skin (18% grade 1) and fatigue (14% grade 1). Four (14%) patients discontinued low dose ketoconazole due to toxicities. Of the 16 patients who received high dose ketoconazole after disease progression with low dose ketoconazole, 3 were removed from treatment due to toxicity and no patient responded to high dose ketoconazole. There was no difference in the distribution of pretreatment endocrine values between responders and nonresponders, and the magnitude of change in adrenal androgen levels was not associated with response to therapy, although a potential association could easily have been missed due to small sample size. The regimen of low dose ketoconazole with replacement doses of hydrocortisone is well tolerated and has moderate activity in patients with progressive androgen independent prostate cancer.",Journal Article,6382.0,102.0,High-dose 400 mg. oral ketoconazole 3 times daily replacement doses hydrocortisone standard treatment option patients advanced prostate progresses androgen deprivation toxicity hinder ability deliver treatment cost regimen substantial prospective phase II conducted assess efficacy safety regimen low dose 200 mg. oral ketoconazole 3 times daily replacement doses hydrocortisone men androgen independent prostate included 28 patients progressive prostate despite anorchid levels testosterone ongoing testicular androgen suppression Treatment consisted low dose ketoconazole replacement doses oral hydrocortisone 20 mg. morning 10 mg. bedtime time disease progression patients treated high dose ketoconazole continued dose hydrocortisone Adrenal androgen levels measured baseline followup levels correlated clinical outcome Overall 13 46 28 patients prostate specific antigen decrease 50 95 confidence interval 27.5 66.1 Median duration prostate specific antigen decrease responders 30+ weeks 5 patients continue exhibit response ranging 36+ 53+ weeks general therapy tolerated grade 4 toxicities Grade 3 toxicities included hepatotoxicity 1 patient depression 2 common toxicities nausea 29 grades 1 2 dry skin 18 grade 1 fatigue 14 grade 1 14 patients discontinued low dose ketoconazole toxicities 16 patients received high dose ketoconazole disease progression low dose ketoconazole 3 removed treatment toxicity patient responded high dose ketoconazole difference distribution pretreatment endocrine values responders nonresponders magnitude change adrenal androgen levels associated response therapy potential association easily missed small size regimen low dose ketoconazole replacement doses hydrocortisone tolerated moderate activity patients progressive androgen independent prostate,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[64, 61, 1524, 81, 518, 6074, 27, 1072, 391, 5, 3892, 415, 1, 17127, 71, 1417, 8, 260, 24, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 131, 12, 92, 6752, 50, 687, 1868, 137, 155, 122, 13006, 3, 801, 6, 3392, 24, 2, 3, 835, 1, 3, 477, 122, 40, 1281, 673, 8, 482, 124, 215, 45, 10, 426, 6, 423, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 8, 477, 1, 154, 61, 1250, 81, 518, 6074, 27, 1072, 391, 5, 3892, 415, 1, 17127, 4, 325, 5, 687, 306, 12, 3, 45, 159, 339, 7, 5, 1014, 12, 550, 30280, 148, 1, 2660, 2, 942, 687, 1332, 24, 1695, 1, 154, 61, 6074, 2, 3892, 415, 1, 518, 17127, 179, 81, 454, 10426, 2, 79, 81, 28, 23133, 28, 3, 98, 1, 34, 91, 7, 11, 73, 5, 64, 61, 6074, 2, 1351, 23, 3, 827, 61, 1, 17127, 2987, 687, 148, 11, 644, 2, 330, 2, 3569, 148, 438, 5, 38, 228, 63, 233, 641, 1, 339, 7, 42, 8, 112, 448, 775, 1, 80, 76, 212, 48, 307, 268, 428, 33, 6, 700, 14, 52, 654, 1, 112, 448, 775, 9, 62, 1983, 10, 201, 244, 2, 33, 7, 1906, 6, 2239, 8, 51, 2223, 29, 511, 6, 699, 244, 4, 1083, 36, 10, 149, 421, 125, 11, 77, 88, 39, 385, 88, 27, 385, 159, 6667, 4, 14, 69, 2, 1774, 4, 18, 3, 96, 186, 385, 11, 1218, 462, 2276, 14, 2, 18, 7922, 203, 88, 14, 2, 613, 213, 88, 14, 294, 213, 7, 2402, 154, 61, 6074, 520, 6, 385, 1, 3, 245, 7, 54, 103, 64, 61, 6074, 50, 34, 91, 5, 154, 61, 6074, 27, 11, 2264, 29, 24, 520, 6, 155, 2, 77, 69, 2211, 6, 64, 61, 6074, 125, 10, 77, 523, 4, 3, 1395, 1, 1194, 1293, 1030, 59, 1983, 2, 4498, 2, 3, 3131, 1, 707, 4, 2987, 687, 148, 10, 44, 41, 5, 51, 6, 36, 242, 8, 174, 248, 359, 4697, 47, 85, 5149, 520, 6, 302, 1000, 444, 3, 477, 1, 154, 61, 6074, 5, 3892, 415, 1, 17127, 16, 149, 421, 2, 71, 1163, 128, 4, 7, 5, 1014, 687, 306, 12]",2311.0,12131305,Low dose ketoconazole replacement doses hydrocortisone patients progressive androgen independent prostate,0,0.0

In the current study, the authors retrospectively examined the clinical history of 12 patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastases. Pathologic review and immunohistochemical staining were performed on tumors from eight of these patients. Patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastasis responded to androgen ablative therapy (median duration, 33 months). They were predisposed to developing persistent or recurrent urinary symptoms and visceral metastases. Six of 9 evaluable patients had elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (> 6 ng/mL), whereas 2 of 10 patients had low or undetectable serum prostate specific antigen levels (< 4 ng/mL). In seven of the eight patients for whom specimens were available, the tumors were found to contain histologic features that were compatible with a diagnosis of ductal or endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients with prostate carcinoma and testicular or penile metastases have unique clinical and pathologic characteristics.

Secondary hormonal manipulation of prostate cancer.,Seminars in urologic oncology,Semin. Urol. Oncol.,2002-08-01,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among men in Western countries. The initial treatment of advanced prostate cancer is suppression of testicular androgen production by medical or surgical castration, but nearly all men with metastases will develop disease progression. Patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) have a median survival of approximately 18 months, and no therapy has yet demonstrated a definitive survival advantage. However, in the past several years, a number of promising new treatment strategies have emerged.

"CML28 is a broadly immunogenic antigen, which is overexpressed in tumor cells.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2002-10-01,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) reliably induces durable remission in 75-80% of patients with relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To identify immunological targets of the graft-versus-leukemia response (GVL) after DLI, we used CML post-DLI responder sera to screen a CML cDNA expression library. One of the antigens identified in this screen is a M(r) 28,000 protein, termed CML28. CML28 is identical to hRrp46p, a component of the human exosome, a multiprotein complex involved in the 3' processing of RNA. Components of the human exosome include known autoantigens, such as PMScl-100, an autoantibody target in patients with polymyositis, scleroderma, or polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome. Recombinant CML28-GST fusion protein was purified, and used in Western blot and ELISA to demonstrate the development of a high-titer CML28-specific IgG antibody response in a patient with relapsed CML who responded to DLI. Northern blotting demonstrated that CML28 is highly expressed in a variety of hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines, but not in normal hematopoietic tissues or other normal tissue, with the exception of testis. Purified recombinant CML28 was used to generate a CML28-specific murine monoclonal antibody. Western blotting with CML28 monoclonal antibody against whole-cell lysates derived from blood and marrow of normal donors and patients with leukemia revealed high expression of this antigen in tumor but not in normal samples. Because CML28 was highly expressed in epithelial tumor cell lines, anti-CML28 responses were also examined in patients with solid tumors. By ELISA, we found specific serological responses in 10-33% of patients with lung cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Our studies suggest that immunogenicity of CML28 is likely because of overexpression of this antigen in tumor cells. Moreover, given its expression and immunogenicity in a wide variety of malignancies, CML28 merits additional evaluation as a target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.",Journal Article,6321.0,66.0,"Donor lymphocyte infusion DLI reliably induces durable remission 75-80 patients relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia CML allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation identify immunological targets graft-versus-leukemia response GVL DLI CML post-DLI responder sera screen CML cDNA expression library antigens identified screen r 28,000 termed CML28 CML28 identical hRrp46p component human exosome multiprotein complex involved 3 processing RNA Components human exosome include known autoantigens PMScl-100 autoantibody target patients polymyositis scleroderma polymyositis-scleroderma overlap syndrome Recombinant CML28-GST fusion purified Western blot ELISA demonstrate development high-titer CML28-specific IgG antibody response patient relapsed CML responded DLI Northern blotting demonstrated CML28 highly expressed variety hematopoietic epithelial lines normal hematopoietic tissues normal tissue exception testis Purified recombinant CML28 generate CML28-specific murine monoclonal antibody Western blotting CML28 monoclonal antibody whole-cell lysates derived blood marrow normal donors patients leukemia revealed high expression antigen normal CML28 highly expressed epithelial lines anti-CML28 responses examined patients solid ELISA specific serological responses 10-33 patients lung melanoma prostate studies suggest immunogenicity CML28 likely overexpression antigen given expression immunogenicity wide variety malignancies CML28 merits additional evaluation target antigen-specific immunotherapy",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1488, 1448, 904, 4676, 4092, 1516, 1480, 734, 4, 481, 493, 1, 7, 5, 591, 442, 2194, 903, 50, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 6, 255, 5073, 637, 1, 3, 1599, 185, 2647, 51, 8149, 50, 4676, 21, 95, 903, 539, 4676, 8735, 4210, 6, 2413, 8, 903, 4212, 55, 4157, 104, 1, 3, 1575, 108, 4, 26, 2413, 16, 8, 188, 668, 339, 984, 178, 4183, 16257, 16257, 16, 3038, 6, 53143, 8, 1249, 1, 3, 171, 11771, 8, 30318, 840, 646, 4, 3, 27, 3325, 1, 893, 1628, 1, 3, 171, 11771, 643, 440, 20227, 225, 22, 53144, 394, 35, 10969, 283, 4, 7, 5, 26038, 11590, 15, 26038, 11590, 4526, 681, 2835, 16257, 5645, 1212, 178, 10, 5963, 2, 95, 4, 1521, 2639, 2, 3664, 6, 608, 3, 193, 1, 8, 64, 8444, 16257, 112, 3630, 548, 51, 4, 8, 69, 5, 591, 903, 54, 2211, 6, 4676, 7088, 3661, 264, 17, 16257, 16, 561, 570, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 1007, 2, 701, 30, 31, 285, 84, 44, 4, 295, 1007, 742, 15, 127, 295, 246, 5, 3, 4188, 1, 5963, 2835, 16257, 10, 95, 6, 2562, 8, 16257, 112, 1471, 848, 548, 1521, 3661, 5, 16257, 848, 548, 480, 902, 31, 8674, 526, 29, 315, 2, 581, 1, 295, 2344, 2, 7, 5, 553, 64, 55, 1, 26, 448, 4, 30, 84, 44, 4, 295, 347, 408, 16257, 10, 561, 570, 4, 701, 30, 31, 285, 312, 16257, 253, 11, 120, 409, 4, 7, 5, 537, 57, 20, 3664, 21, 204, 112, 14132, 253, 4, 79, 466, 1, 7, 5, 12, 2, 12, 114, 94, 309, 17, 4050, 1, 16257, 16, 322, 408, 1, 851, 1, 26, 448, 4, 30, 37, 1393, 447, 211, 55, 2, 4050, 4, 8, 1019, 1362, 1, 441, 16257, 4986, 402, 451, 22, 8, 283, 9, 448, 112, 726]",1982.0,12359762,CML28 broadly immunogenic antigen overexpressed,71,0.24067796610169492
Breast cancer in men.,Annals of internal medicine,Ann. Intern. Med.,2002-10-01,"Breast cancer in men is uncommon; 1500 new cases are diagnosed in the United States yearly. Optimal management of breast cancer in men is unknown because the rarity of the disease precludes large randomized trials. A review of the literature was undertaken with emphasis on articles published over a 10-year period. Articles published between 1942 and 2000 on breast cancer in men were identified by using CancerLit, MEDLINE, and study bibliographies. All retrospective series and studies focusing on the epidemiology, risk factors, genetics, and pathology of breast cancer in men. Data on the epidemiology, risk factors, genetics, pathology, molecular markers, prognostic factors, therapy, and outcomes of breast cancer in men. Carcinoma of the male breast accounts for 0.8% of all breast cancers. Risk factors include testicular disease, benign breast conditions, age, Jewish ancestry, family history, and the Klinefelter syndrome. BRCA2 mutations predispose men to breast cancer and may account for 4% to 14% of all cases. Pathology data were reviewed: 81% of tumors were estrogen receptor positive, 74% were progesterone receptor positive, 37% overexpressed c-erbB-2, 30% overexpressed p53, 79% overexpressed Bcl-2, 51% overexpressed cyclin D1, and 39% overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor. Prognostic factors include tumor size, histologic grade, and lymph node status; survival is similar to that of breast cancer in women when patients are matched for age and stage. Adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, using the same guidelines as for women, are recommended for men. Hormonal therapy is the primary therapy for metastatic disease; chemotherapy should be reserved for hormone-refractory disease.

Repeat retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic testis cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-04-01,"We report pathological results, perioperative complications and patient outcome in 21 men after repeat retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic testis cancer. We reviewed an institutional tumor registry at our cancer center and identified 417 patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testis cancer during a 21-year period. Of these 417 patients 21 underwent repeat retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. We reviewed preoperative patient characteristics, operative data and pathological findings from repeat lymphadenectomy, and determined patient disease status, morbidity and mortality after surgery. We identified viable germ cell tumor in 5 patients (24%), teratoma in 14 (67%) and fibrosis or necrosis only in 5 (24%). Intraoperatively subadventitial dissection of the aorta occurred in 2 cases, which was severe enough in 1 to require an aortic graft. The most common postoperative complications were prolonged ileus or partial bowel obstruction and chylous ascites in 6 and 3 patients, respectively. Six patients died, including 5 of disease progression and 1 of postoperative pulmonary embolus.

Acute myeloid leukemia mimicking primary testicular neoplasm. Presentation of a case with review of literature.,European journal of haematology,Eur. J. Haematol.,2003-04-01,"We describe a new unique case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a 21-yr-old male presenting with abdominal pain, bilateral testicular masses and gynecomastia. Further work-up with computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed massive retroperitoneal, peripancreatic and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggesting primary testicular neoplasm. The patient was subjected to right orchiectomy that showed infiltration of testicular tissue with malignant cells, originally misinterpreted as undifferentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry studies, however, showed these cells to be strongly positive for myeloperoxidase and CD45, indicating a myeloid cell origin. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy demonstrated replacement of marrow with immature myeloid cells. Both the morphology and immunophenotype of the blast cells were consistent with AML type M4 (acute myelo-monocytic leukemia), using French-American-British (FAB) classification. The patient received standard induction chemotherapy with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and daunorubicin followed with two cycles of consolidation therapy with high dose ARA-C, which resulted in remission of BM disease and resolution of lymphadenopathy and left testicular masses. After the second cycle of consolidation therapy, the patient developed sepsis that was complicated by refractory disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

Molecular monitoring of cerebrospinal fluid can predict clinical relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2003-05-01,"In a patient with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with eosinophilia that completely responded to induction chemotherapy, we assayed serial remission cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow specimens for minimal residual disease using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to assess for clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene cluster (IGH) gene rearrangement. Cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia and minimal residual disease were detected on day 406, preceding the morphologic diagnosis of central nervous system relapse on day 578. By day 841, the bone marrow had 35% blasts. Despite aggressive therapy, including unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation, the patient developed testicular and bone marrow relapses and died of disease. We conclude that increasing levels of minimal residual disease in cerebrospinal fluid can predict recurrence of ALL prior to clinical and morphologic relapse. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel translocation in this tumor, the t(5;9)(q31;p24), that possibly led to fusion of the interleukin-3 (IL3) (5q31) and JAK2 (9p24) genes and may explain the concomitant appearance of eosinophilia and ALL.",Case Reports,6109.0,19.0,patient precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated eosinophilia completely responded induction chemotherapy assayed serial remission cerebrospinal fluid bone marrow specimens minimal residual disease quantitative polymerase chain reaction assess clone-specific immunoglobulin heavy-chain cluster IGH rearrangement Cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia minimal residual disease detected day 406 preceding morphologic diagnosis central nervous relapse day 578 day 841 bone marrow 35 blasts Despite aggressive therapy including unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation patient developed testicular bone marrow relapses died disease conclude increasing levels minimal residual disease cerebrospinal fluid predict recurrence prior clinical morphologic relapse Furthermore demonstrate novel translocation 5 9 q31 p24 possibly led fusion interleukin-3 IL3 5q31 JAK2 9p24 explain concomitant appearance eosinophilia,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 8, 69, 5, 2765, 132, 31, 286, 1275, 62, 41, 5, 13555, 17, 2500, 2211, 6, 504, 56, 21, 4499, 2108, 734, 5156, 2357, 2, 581, 623, 9, 1048, 753, 34, 75, 8, 1156, 1451, 1260, 1329, 719, 6, 423, 9, 3910, 112, 2593, 4013, 1260, 145, 3132, 5221, 145, 2675, 5156, 2357, 13555, 2, 1048, 753, 34, 11, 530, 23, 218, 8522, 5892, 3, 2815, 147, 1, 854, 1880, 398, 429, 23, 218, 10431, 20, 218, 18269, 3, 581, 42, 465, 2438, 550, 571, 36, 141, 2092, 5998, 1885, 315, 497, 3, 69, 276, 2, 581, 3713, 2, 1016, 1, 34, 21, 2060, 17, 602, 148, 1, 1048, 753, 34, 4, 5156, 2357, 122, 678, 146, 1, 62, 324, 6, 38, 2, 2815, 429, 798, 21, 608, 8, 229, 2006, 4, 26, 30, 3, 102, 33, 83, 53499, 43136, 17, 2150, 836, 6, 1212, 1, 3, 1603, 27, 20283, 22069, 2, 2509, 10450, 214, 2, 68, 2943, 3, 1781, 3592, 1, 13555, 2, 62]",1116.0,12708906,Molecular monitoring cerebrospinal fluid predict clinical relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia eosinophilia,0,0.0

Results of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for clinical stage I and II pure embryonal carcinoma of the testis.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-10-01,"We determined the pathological findings and clinical outcome of patients with pure embryonal carcinoma (EC) of the testis managed by primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. From January 1989 to February 1998, 45 patients with pure EC underwent primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at our institution. Patients presented as clinical stage I in 26, IIA in 17 and IIB in 2. Lymphovascular invasion was present in 29 (64%). Median followup was 36.8 months. Overall the pathological stage was pN0 in 11, pN1 in 10 (4 with microscopic disease) and pN2/N3 in 24 patients (8 with extranodal extension). Nineteen of 26 patients (73%) with clinical stage I and 13 of 17 (77%) patients with clinical stage IIA had retroperitoneal disease. No patient with negative lymph nodes (pN0) has had relapse. Only 1 of 9 (11%) patients with pN1 treated without adjuvant chemotherapy has had relapse. Of 24 patients with pN2/N3 disease only 3 (12%) have required more than 2 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy for persistent or recurrent disease despite complete resection of the retroperitoneum.

Stroma adjacent to metastatic mature teratoma after chemotherapy for testicular germ cell tumors is derived from the same progenitor cells as the teratoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-09-01,"Metastatic mature teratoma is often present in postchemotherapy surgical specimens of lymph nodes from patients with pathological stage II or III testicular germ cell tumors. The stromal cells in these lesions have generally been considered ""fibrosis"" secondary to the chemotherapy and the necrosis it causes, although the frequent cytological atypia of the stromal cells suggests that they may be neoplastic. We studied 25 patients with pathological stage II or III testicular cancer who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of retroperitoneal lymph nodes that contained metastatic mature teratoma with ""fibrosis"" to determine the reactive or neoplastic nature of the stromal cells. We compared the pattern of allelic loss using nine microsatellite DNA markers (D9S177, D9S303, D9S778, D9S171, D12S1015, D1S508, D2S156, D18S46, and D11S903) between the epithelial cells of the teratoma and the cells in the adjacent stroma. A laser capture microdissection technique facilitated preparation of genomic DNA from the epithelial components of teratoma, adjacent stromal cells, and normal lymph node tissue from each patient. Of the 25 patients, loss of heterozygosity was seen at a minimum of one focus in 22 (92%) of the teratoma specimens and 16 (64%) of the adjacent stroma. Of the 16 cases for which the stroma showed loss of heterozygosity, 8 cases showed the identical pattern of allelic loss in the epithelial cells of the adjacent teratoma at all nine DNA loci studied. The remaining eight cases showed similar allelic loss in at least one of the nine DNA loci analyzed. Interestingly, three cases showed loss of heterozygosity in the stroma that was not seen in the matching teratoma specimens. Our results indicate that the stromal cells adjacent to metastatic mature teratoma in postchemotherapy lymph node specimens frequently have genetic abnormalities similar to the metastatic teratoma. Concordant genetic alterations observed in teratoma and stroma suggest that both are derived from the same element of the original germ cell tumor or the same progenitor cell.",Journal Article,5986.0,44.0,Metastatic mature teratoma present postchemotherapy surgical specimens lymph nodes patients pathological stage II III testicular germ stromal lesions generally considered `` fibrosis '' secondary chemotherapy necrosis causes frequent cytological atypia stromal suggests neoplastic studied 25 patients pathological stage II III testicular treated platinum-based chemotherapy followed surgical resection retroperitoneal lymph nodes contained metastatic mature teratoma `` fibrosis '' determine reactive neoplastic nature stromal compared pattern allelic loss microsatellite DNA markers D9S177 D9S303 D9S778 D9S171 D12S1015 D1S508 D2S156 D18S46 D11S903 epithelial teratoma adjacent stroma laser capture microdissection technique facilitated preparation genomic DNA epithelial components teratoma adjacent stromal normal lymph node tissue patient 25 patients loss heterozygosity seen minimum focus 22 92 teratoma specimens 16 64 adjacent stroma 16 cases stroma showed loss heterozygosity 8 cases showed identical pattern allelic loss epithelial adjacent teratoma DNA loci studied remaining cases showed similar allelic loss DNA loci Interestingly cases showed loss heterozygosity stroma seen matching teratoma specimens indicate stromal adjacent metastatic mature teratoma postchemotherapy lymph node specimens frequently genetic abnormalities similar metastatic teratoma Concordant genetic alterations observed teratoma stroma suggest derived element original germ progenitor,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[113, 2908, 4845, 16, 629, 364, 4, 6241, 221, 623, 1, 263, 502, 29, 7, 5, 1301, 82, 215, 15, 316, 2280, 31, 57, 3, 1126, 37, 4, 46, 406, 47, 1228, 85, 515, 3000, 522, 568, 6, 3, 56, 2, 3, 1523, 192, 1626, 242, 3, 908, 9019, 3598, 1, 3, 1126, 37, 844, 17, 491, 68, 40, 2000, 21, 656, 243, 7, 5, 1301, 82, 215, 15, 316, 12, 54, 11, 73, 5, 828, 90, 56, 370, 20, 221, 170, 1, 2591, 263, 502, 17, 3070, 113, 2908, 4845, 5, 3000, 522, 6, 223, 3, 2163, 15, 2000, 2202, 1, 3, 1126, 37, 21, 72, 3, 1177, 1, 3861, 407, 75, 762, 2226, 261, 525, 43378, 53774, 53775, 53776, 53777, 53778, 53779, 53780, 2, 53781, 59, 3, 701, 37, 1, 3, 4845, 2, 3, 37, 4, 3, 2086, 2477, 8, 3555, 2891, 8338, 1312, 4667, 4824, 1, 572, 261, 29, 3, 701, 1628, 1, 4845, 2086, 1126, 37, 2, 295, 263, 289, 246, 29, 296, 69, 1, 3, 243, 7, 407, 1, 3963, 10, 527, 28, 8, 2499, 1, 104, 1222, 4, 350, 937, 1, 3, 4845, 623, 2, 245, 660, 1, 3, 2086, 2477, 1, 3, 245, 140, 9, 92, 3, 2477, 224, 407, 1, 3963, 66, 140, 224, 3, 3038, 1177, 1, 3861, 407, 4, 3, 701, 37, 1, 3, 2086, 4845, 28, 62, 762, 261, 2012, 656, 3, 1844, 659, 140, 224, 288, 3861, 407, 4, 28, 506, 104, 1, 3, 762, 261, 2012, 311, 2873, 169, 140, 224, 407, 1, 3963, 4, 3, 2477, 17, 10, 44, 527, 4, 3, 2616, 4845, 623, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 3, 1126, 37, 2086, 6, 113, 2908, 4845, 4, 6241, 263, 289, 623, 746, 47, 336, 1171, 288, 6, 3, 113, 4845, 3610, 336, 593, 164, 4, 4845, 2, 2477, 309, 17, 110, 32, 526, 29, 3, 827, 4467, 1, 3, 2279, 2280, 31, 30, 15, 3, 827, 2520, 31]",2067.0,14522936,Stroma adjacent metastatic mature teratoma chemotherapy testicular germ derived progenitor teratoma,1,0.003389830508474576

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center germ cell tumor surgical database was reviewed from January 1989 through April 2001, and the clinical characteristics of patients undergoing reoperative retroperitoneal surgery for nonseminomatous germ cell tumor were identified. The initial presentation, histologic findings, morbidity, and survival were analyzed. Disease-specific survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 56 patients underwent 61 repeat operations: 22 after primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) and 34 after postchemotherapy RPLND. Left testicular primary tumors were more common than right (33 versus 23), and the most common sites of disease prompting reoperation were the para-aortic and left hilar regions. Teratoma was the most common histologic finding at the time of reoperation. Of 56 patients, 37 (66%) required chemotherapy between the initial operation and reoperation. The overall perioperative complication rate was 27%, and median length of hospital stay was 8 days. Sixty-nine percent of patients required adjunctive procedures at the time of reoperation, the most common of which was thoracotomy. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 67% for the entire group (86% following reoperation after primary RPLND and 56% following reoperation after postchemotherapy RPLND). Reoperative retroperitoneal surgery for nonseminomatous germ cell tumor can be performed with acceptable morbidity in select referral centers. Teratoma is highly prevalent in the retroperitoneum at the time of reoperation.

The alternative open reading frame of LAGE-1 gives rise to multiple promiscuous HLA-DR-restricted epitopes recognized by T-helper 1-type tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2003-10-01,"The NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 genes are expressed by many human cancers, but not by normal tissues, with the exception of testis and placenta. The NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 genes give rise to multiple MHC class I and class II-presented epitopes derived from the open reading frames (ORF) 1 and 2. Here, we have investigated whether NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 ORF2 encodes promiscuous MHC class II-restricted epitopes. Using a set of overlapping peptides from the ORF2 protein sequence and autologous dendritic cells (DCs) from normal donors and melanoma patients, we have identified three HLA-DRB1*0401-restricted peptide sequences from the LAGE-1 ORF2 that are capable of stimulating T-helper 1-type melanoma-reactive CD4+ T cells. From these bulk CD4+ T cells, we have generated CD4+ T-cell clones able to recognize not only peptide-pulsed DCs but also autologous DCs loaded with the LAGE-1 ORF2 protein. We have demonstrated that these peptides not only bind to multiple HLA-DR molecules apart from HLA-DRB1*0401 but also stimulate CD4+ T cells when presented in the context of these HLA-DR molecules. Furthermore, our binding data have delineated two additional sequences capable of broadly binding to multiple HLA-DR molecules. Altogether, these data support the immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 ORF2 gene products and clearly demonstrate their capability to stimulate T-helper 1 type CD4+ T cells.

Clinical outcome after retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy of patients with pure testicular teratoma.,Urology,Urology,2003-12-01,"To determine the pathologic findings and clinical outcome of patients with pure teratoma of the testis who underwent primary or postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLND). From January 1989 to February 1998, 29 patients with pure testicular teratoma underwent primary (n = 11) or postchemotherapy (n = 18) RPLND. Overall, 23 (79%) of 29 patients had retroperitoneal disease, with 18 (62%) initially presenting with advanced disease. The pathologic stage in the 11 patients undergoing primary RPLND was pN0 in 6 (55%), pN1 in 3 (27%), and pN2 in 2 (18%). Of the 7 patients with clinical Stage I undergoing primary RPLND, 1 had teratoma and 1 had seminoma in the retroperitoneum; of the 4 patients with clinical Stage IIA, 2 had teratoma and 1 had embryonal carcinoma. Four patients were lost to follow-up and the other seven had no evidence of disease (NED) at a median follow-up of 90.4 months, with no relapses. The pathologic findings in the 18 patients undergoing postchemotherapy RPLND revealed fibrosis in 8, teratoma in 9, and yolk sac tumor in 1. At last follow-up, 7 of the 9 patients with teratoma were NED, 1 was dead of disease, and 1 was dead of unknown causes. Of the 8 patients with fibrosis, 6 had NED and 2 were lost to follow-up. The patient with viable cancer had NED at last follow-up. These data underscore the metastatic potential of pure testicular teratoma.

Frequency of NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 expression in bladder cancer and evidence of a new NY-ESO-1 T-cell epitope in a patient with bladder cancer.,Cancer immunity,Cancer Immun.,2003-12-18,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are ideal vaccine targets since their expression is restricted in adult tissues to testicular germ cells and a subset of cancers. The frequency of expression in transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of NY-ESO-1, the most immunogenic CT antigen to date, and its closely related gene LAGE-1 was studied. NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 antigen expression were found to occur frequently in high-grade TCC tumors. On an MSKCC IRB-approved protocol, 68 patient specimens were collected prospectively at the time of transurethral resection or cystectomy, of which 43 were read pathologically as high-grade tumors (pCIS, pTaG3, pT1, pT2, pT3, and pT4), 8 as low-grade tumors (pTaG1, pTaG2), and 17 as disease-free samples. These 68 samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or RT-PCR. There were also an additional 53 paraffin-embedded specimens studied retrospectively by IHC, of which 39 were high-grade tumors and 14 were low-grade tumors. Cumulatively, our data indicate that NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 are expressed in 39/82 (48%) high-grade TCC and 3/22 (14%) low-grade TCC samples when analyzed by RT-PCR and/or IHC. Immunological assessment of these patients' sera identified one patient, whose tumor homogeneously expressed NY-ESO-1, which had detectable antibodies against NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Further analysis of this patient, who remains clinically without evidence of disease 24 months after cystectomy for high-grade pT4 disease, revealed T-cell immunity against NY-ESO-1.

A novel mechanism of alternative promoter and splicing regulates the epitope generation of tumor antigen CML66-L.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2004-01-01,"This report describes the difference in the epitope generation of two isoforms of self-tumor Ag CML66 and the regulation mechanism. We identified a new CML66 short isoform, termed CML66-S. The previously identified long CML66 is referred to as CML66-L. CML66-S shares the C terminus with CML66-L but has its unique N terminus. CML66-S is predominantly expressed in testis, but is also expressed in very low levels in tumor cells, whereas CML66-L is expressed in tumor cells and testis. Differential expression of CML66-L and CML66-S in tumor cells resulted from regulation at transcription, although alternative splicing also participated in the generation of the isoforms. In addition, Ab titers to a CML66-L peptide were significantly higher than that to CML66-S peptide in the sera from patients with tumors. Finally, the Abs to full-length CML66-L in the sera from patients with tumors were correlated with the Abs in the sera from these patients to CML66-L-38, which is a fusion protein with a CML66-L-specific N terminus. This suggests that the CML66-L isoform is mainly responsible for the epitope generation.

SMRs were calculated for all causes of death, cardiac deaths, and cancer deaths using standard US data for males. After a median follow-up of 13.3 years, the 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-year actuarial survival rates were 93%, 79%, 59%, and 26%, respectively. The all-cause SMR over the entire observation interval was 1.59 (99% CI, 1.21 to 2.04). The SMR was not excessive for the first 15 years of follow-up: SMR, 1.30 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.77); but beyond 15 years the SMR was 1.85 (99% CI, 1.30 to 2.55). The overall cardiac-specific SMR was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.24). The cardiac SMR was significantly elevated only beyond 15 years (P <.01). The overall cancer-specific SMR was 1.91 (99% CI, 1.14 to 2.98). The cancer SMR was also significant only after 15 years of follow-up (P <.01). An increased mortality was evident in patients treated with and without mediastinal XRT. Long-term survivors of seminoma treated with post-orchiectomy XRT are at significant excess risk of death as a result of cardiac disease or second cancer. Management strategies that minimize these risks but maintain the excellent hitherto observed cure rates need to be actively pursued.",Journal Article,5850.0,233.0,determine incidence potentially treatment-related mortality long-term survivors testicular seminoma treated orchiectomy radiation therapy XRT 477 men stage II testicular seminoma treated University Texas M.D Anderson Center Houston TX post-orchiectomy megavoltage XRT 1951 1999 453 sustained relapse disease Long-term survival 453 men evaluated person-years determine standardized mortality ratio SMR SMRs calculated causes death cardiac deaths deaths standard males median follow-up 13.3 years 10- 20- 30- 40-year actuarial survival rates 93 79 59 26 respectively all-cause SMR entire observation interval 1.59 99 CI 1.21 2.04 SMR excessive 15 years follow-up SMR 1.30 95 CI 0.93 1.77 15 years SMR 1.85 99 CI 1.30 2.55 overall cardiac-specific SMR 1.61 95 CI 1.21 2.24 cardiac SMR significantly elevated 15 years P .01 overall cancer-specific SMR 1.91 99 CI 1.14 2.98 SMR significant 15 years follow-up P .01 increased mortality evident patients treated mediastinal XRT Long-term survivors seminoma treated post-orchiectomy XRT significant excess risk death cardiac disease second Management strategies minimize risks maintain excellent hitherto observed cure rates need actively pursued,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 751, 24, 139, 282, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 6930, 73, 20, 9377, 2, 121, 36, 3429, 29, 62, 11810, 325, 5, 82, 70, 15, 215, 6930, 73, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 2738, 188, 427, 1929, 12, 574, 6212, 6614, 5, 539, 9377, 17688, 3429, 59, 28040, 2, 2043, 9861, 1737, 2275, 429, 1, 136, 34, 319, 337, 25, 9, 46, 9861, 325, 10, 194, 5, 3, 2719, 60, 596, 6, 223, 3, 1670, 282, 197, 7071, 22183, 11, 981, 9, 62, 1626, 1, 273, 1043, 2, 12, 1043, 75, 260, 843, 74, 9, 2296, 50, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 233, 27, 60, 3, 79, 179, 201, 2, 327, 111, 2361, 25, 151, 11, 966, 842, 728, 2, 432, 106, 3, 62, 708, 7071, 252, 3, 1797, 1664, 268, 10, 14, 728, 1058, 58, 14, 239, 6, 18, 755, 3, 7071, 10, 44, 4529, 9, 3, 157, 167, 60, 1, 166, 126, 7071, 14, 201, 48, 58, 13, 966, 6, 14, 849, 84, 1654, 167, 60, 3, 7071, 10, 14, 772, 1058, 58, 14, 201, 6, 18, 614, 3, 63, 13514, 112, 7071, 10, 14, 713, 48, 58, 14, 239, 6, 18, 259, 3, 7071, 10, 97, 804, 158, 1654, 167, 60, 19, 355, 3, 63, 12, 112, 7071, 10, 14, 970, 1058, 58, 14, 213, 6, 18, 1096, 3, 12, 7071, 10, 120, 93, 158, 50, 167, 60, 1, 166, 126, 19, 355, 35, 101, 282, 10, 2853, 4, 7, 73, 5, 2, 187, 2626, 3429, 319, 337, 332, 1, 6930, 73, 5, 539, 9377, 3429, 32, 28, 93, 2612, 43, 1, 273, 22, 8, 757, 1, 34, 15, 419, 12, 284, 422, 17, 3241, 46, 1098, 84, 3040, 3, 1503, 14471, 164, 1722, 151, 594, 6, 40, 4489, 5299]",1588.0,14726503,Mortality cure testicular seminoma,1,0.003389830508474576
"Genomic organization, incidence, and localization of the SPAN-x family of cancer-testis antigens in melanoma tumors and cell lines.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-01-01,"Members of the SPAN-X (sperm protein associated with the nucleus mapped to the X chromosome) family of cancer-testis antigens are promising targets for tumor immunotherapy because they are normally expressed exclusively during spermiogenesis on the adluminal side of the blood-testis barrier, an immune privileged compartment. This study analyzed the human SPANX genomic organization, as well as SPAN-X mRNA and protein expression in somatic and cancer cells. The SPANX family consists of five genes, one of which is duplicated, all located in a gene cluster at Xq27.1. From the centromere, the arrangement of the five SPANX genes mapped on one contiguous sequence is SPANXB, -C, -A1, -A2, and -D. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses demonstrated expression of SPAN-X mRNA in melanoma and ovarian cell lines, and virtual Northern analysis established SPANX gene expression in numerous cancer cell lines. Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant SPAN-X confirmed the translation of SPAN-X proteins in melanoma and ovarian tumor cell lines. The immunoreactive proteins migrated between M(r) 15,000 and M(r) 20,000 similar to those observed in spermatozoa. Immunoperoxidase labeling of melanoma cells and tissue sections demonstrated SPAN-X protein localization in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or both. Ultrastructurally, in melanoma cells with nuclear SPAN-X, the protein was associated with the nuclear envelope, a localization similar to that observed in human spermatids and spermatozoa. Significantly, the incidence of SPAN-X-positive immunostaining was greatest in the more aggressive skin tumors, particularly in distant, nonlymphatic metastatic melanomas. The data herein suggest that the SPAN-X protein may be a useful target in cancer immunotherapy.",Journal Article,5864.0,41.0,"Members SPAN-X sperm associated nucleus mapped X chromosome family cancer-testis antigens promising targets immunotherapy normally expressed exclusively spermiogenesis adluminal blood-testis barrier immune privileged compartment human SPANX genomic organization SPAN-X mRNA expression somatic SPANX family consists duplicated located cluster Xq27.1 centromere arrangement SPANX mapped contiguous sequence SPANXB -C -A1 -A2 -D.

"Vascular neurotoxicity following chemotherapy with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide.",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Ann Pharmacother,2003-12-15,"To report a case of acute central nervous system (CNS) toxicity with multiple hemorrhages restricted to the corpus callosum associated with combination therapy of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide. A 38-year-old white man with a testicular germ cell tumor received a cisplatin-based chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin 45 mg (20 mg/m2), etoposide 570 mg (250 mg/m2), and ifosfamide 4600 mg (2000 mg/m2) given on 5 consecutive days during each course. After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient appeared to be neuropsychologically impaired with episodes of decreased alertness and features of a depressive syndrome. He became severely diminished in mental function, orientation, and psychomotor activity after a second course of treatment. In addition, he showed transient urinary incontinence. Motor and sensory deficits could not be detected. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple hemorrhages restricted to the corpus callosum. An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was probable. Neurotoxicity has been associated with the administration of various antineoplastic agents. In particular, cisplatin and ifosfamide can cause both acute and delayed CNS toxicity. While ifosfamide neurotoxicity has been predominantly associated with neuropsychological impairment without evidence of structural abnormalities in neuroimaging studies, cisplatin has been shown to cause cerebrovascular complications. Various pathophysiologic conditions may contribute to these complications including thrombosis secondary to vascular endothelial injury or thromboembolic events. To our knowledge, as of December 2, 2003, vascular lesions restricted to the corpus callosum have not been reported as a complication of cisplatin- or ifosfamide-based chemotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of the potential neurovascular adverse effects of cisplatin-based protocols. This is especially true in patients with subtle neurologic or neuropsychological symptoms.

The cancer screening practices of adult survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"The current study characterized the self-reported cancer screening practices of adult survivors of childhood cancer. A cohort of 9434 long-term survivors of childhood cancer and a comparison group of 2667 siblings completed a 289-item survey that included items regarding cancer-screening practices. Overall, 27.3% of female respondents reported performing breast self-examination (BSE) regularly, 78.2% reported undergoing a Papanicolaou smear within the previous 3 years, 62.4% underwent a clinical breast examination (CBE) within the last year, and 20.9% had gotten a mammogram at least once in their lifetime. Approximately 17.4% of male respondents reported performing regular testicular self-examination (TSE). Women age > or =30 years who had been exposed to chest or mantle radiation therapy were more likely to report undergoing CBE (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.32-1.92) and mammography (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.47-2.56).

Primary follicular lymphoma of the testis: excellent outcome following surgical resection without adjuvant chemotherapy.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2004-02-01,"The authors report a case of follicular lymphoma of the testis in a 3-year-old boy. Follicular lymphoma of childhood is rare, accounting for less than 5% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the pediatric population. Children with follicular NHL have typically been described as presenting with localized disease, with a preponderance of male patients. The authors conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and found that this patient is the only child reported to have localized follicular lymphoma of the testis successfully treated without systemic chemotherapy. In all previously reported cases, a favorable outcome was seen following surgical resection and chemotherapy. This patient has remained disease-free for more than 2 years after surgical resection alone. The successful outcome in this case following surgical resection, without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, suggests that localized follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children may not be associated with occult systemic disease and that subsequent chemotherapy may not be necessary for cure.",Case Reports,5833.0,32.0,authors report case follicular lymphoma testis 3-year-old boy Follicular lymphoma childhood rare accounting 5 non-Hodgkin lymphomas pediatric population Children follicular NHL typically described presenting localized disease preponderance male patients authors conducted comprehensive review literature patient child reported localized follicular lymphoma testis successfully treated systemic chemotherapy previously reported cases favorable outcome seen following surgical resection chemotherapy patient remained disease-free 2 years surgical resection successful outcome case following surgical resection postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy suggests localized follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma children associated occult systemic disease subsequent chemotherapy necessary cure,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 738, 414, 8, 473, 1, 1974, 1, 3, 4, 8, 27, 111, 1095, 10802, 1974, 1, 864, 16, 622, 3116, 9, 299, 76, 33, 1, 62, 1557, 4, 3, 815, 266, 541, 5, 1974, 1176, 47, 1969, 85, 1027, 22, 1656, 5, 909, 34, 5, 8, 12531, 1, 1045, 7, 3, 738, 426, 8, 949, 206, 1, 3, 789, 2, 204, 17, 26, 69, 16, 3, 158, 2566, 210, 6, 47, 909, 1974, 1, 3, 1878, 73, 187, 403, 56, 4, 62, 373, 210, 140, 8, 913, 228, 10, 527, 366, 221, 170, 2, 56, 26, 69, 71, 958, 34, 115, 9, 80, 76, 18, 60, 50, 221, 170, 279, 3, 1401, 228, 4, 26, 473, 366, 221, 170, 187, 573, 249, 56, 844, 17, 909, 1974, 4, 541, 68, 44, 40, 41, 5, 2879, 403, 34, 2, 17, 706, 56, 68, 44, 40, 1493, 9, 1722]",979.0,14767197,Primary follicular lymphoma testis excellent outcome following surgical resection adjuvant chemotherapy,21,0.0711864406779661
Identification of novel and widely expressed cancer/testis gene isoforms that elicit spontaneous cytotoxic T-lymphocyte reactivity to melanoma.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"Multiple isoforms (TAG-1, TAG-2a, TAG-2b, and TAG-2c) of a novel cancer/testis antigen gene have been identified and are expressed in 84-88% of melanoma cell lines tested. The tumor antigen (TAG) genes are also expressed in K562, a myelogenous leukemia cell line, and they have homology to two chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived clones and a hepatocellular carcinoma clone in the human expressed sequence tags (EST) database, thus indicating that their expression is not restricted to melanomas. In contrast to the fact that many cancer/testis antigens are poorly immunogenic, the TAG-derived peptide, RLSNRLLLR, is recognized by HLA-A3-restricted, melanoma-specific CTLs that were obtained from a melanoma patient with spontaneous reactivity to the peptide. Unlike most cancer/testis antigen genes which are located on the X chromosome, the TAG genes are located on chromosome 5. The genes have the additional unusual features of being coded for in an open reading frame that is initiated by one of three nonstandard initiation codons, and the sequence coding the RLSNRLLLR peptide crosses an exon-exon boundary. The properties of the TAG antigens indicate that they are excellent vaccine candidates for the treatment of melanoma and perhaps other cancers.",Journal Article,5833.0,17.0,Multiple isoforms TAG-1 TAG-2a TAG-2b TAG-2c novel cancer/testis antigen identified expressed 84-88 melanoma lines tested antigen TAG expressed K562 myelogenous leukemia line homology chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived clones hepatocellular carcinoma clone human expressed sequence tags EST database indicating expression restricted melanomas contrast fact cancer/testis antigens poorly immunogenic TAG-derived peptide RLSNRLLLR recognized HLA-A3-restricted melanoma-specific CTLs obtained melanoma patient spontaneous reactivity peptide Unlike cancer/testis antigen located X chromosome TAG located chromosome 5 additional unusual features coded open reading frame initiated nonstandard initiation codons sequence coding RLSNRLLLR peptide crosses exon-exon boundary properties TAG antigens indicate excellent vaccine candidates treatment melanoma,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 3913, 7479, 14, 7479, 4707, 7479, 3381, 2, 7479, 11779, 1, 8, 229, 12, 7697, 448, 145, 47, 85, 108, 2, 32, 570, 4, 874, 889, 1, 31, 285, 650, 3, 30, 448, 7479, 214, 32, 120, 570, 4, 5208, 8, 2194, 31, 328, 2, 491, 47, 7984, 6, 100, 442, 2194, 2647, 526, 2749, 2, 8, 134, 3910, 4, 3, 171, 570, 1532, 13059, 13807, 609, 631, 1716, 17, 136, 55, 16, 44, 2016, 6, 1965, 4, 748, 6, 3, 1991, 17, 445, 12, 7697, 1575, 32, 1240, 4190, 3, 7479, 526, 1389, 43510, 16, 1904, 20, 1160, 7024, 2016, 4128, 112, 5416, 17, 11, 683, 29, 8, 69, 5, 3280, 4601, 6, 3, 1389, 4246, 96, 12, 7697, 448, 214, 92, 32, 2308, 23, 3, 1006, 1170, 3, 7479, 214, 32, 2308, 23, 1170, 33, 3, 214, 47, 3, 402, 4015, 404, 1, 486, 8259, 9, 4, 35, 1020, 7299, 5331, 17, 16, 1917, 20, 104, 1, 169, 18798, 1118, 9107, 2, 3, 1532, 3097, 3, 43510, 1389, 17716, 35, 1725, 1725, 8920, 3, 1571, 1, 3, 7479, 1575, 1008, 17, 491, 32, 1503, 1274, 1931, 9, 3, 24, 1, 2, 4434, 127, 163]",1183.0,14871852,Identification novel widely expressed cancer/testis isoforms elicit spontaneous cytotoxic T-lymphocyte reactivity melanoma,65,0.22033898305084745

Two cohorts were analyzed: one receiving MAGE-3 protein alone, and one receiving MAGE-3 protein with adjuvant AS02B. Of nine patients in the first cohort, three developed marginal Ab titers and another one had a CD8(+) T cell response to HLA-A2-restricted peptide MAGE-3 271-279. In contrast, of eight patients from the second cohort vaccinated with MAGE-3 protein and adjuvant, seven developed high-titered Abs to MAGE-3, and four had a strong concomitant CD4(+) T cell response to HLA-DP4-restricted peptide 243-258. One patient simultaneously developed CD8(+) T cells to HLA-A1-restricted peptide 168-176.

In a cohort of patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy for unsuspected metastatic GCT we determined the impact of this surgery on morbidity, therapeutic delay and cancer therapy. Between 1980 and 2001, 40 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy for unsuspected metastatic GCT were later referred to our department for management. Patient records were reviewed retrospectively. Mean patient age at exploratory laparotomy was 34 years. All patients had a midline retroperitoneal mass and 14 had disease at other sites. At the time of evaluation at our institution abnormalities on physical examination and testicular sonogram were identified in 8 (20%) and 22 (55%) patients, respectively. Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and/or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were identified in 26 patients (65%). Eight patients (22%) experienced complications from exploratory surgery. The median interval from laparotomy to chemotherapy was 29 days and in 48% of patients the delay in therapy was 30 days or greater. Of patients with a delay of 30 days or greater 60% required intensive chemotherapy (multiple regimens, or high dose or salvage chemotherapy) compared to 26% with a delay of less than 30 days (p = 0.01).

Testicular cancer.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2004-05-01,"The purpose of this article is to review the recent clinically relevant literature on testicular cancer. Recent studies suggest that an increased incidence of testicular cancer is due to a birth-cohort effect and secondary to early exposure. Work on identifying tumor prognostic characteristics suggests that proliferation and apoptosis markers as well as serum lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1 (S-LD-1) may have value. Poor-risk patients may benefit from intensive treatment despite a possible increased risk of significant toxicity and treatment related deaths. Studies continue to show the efficacy of radiation for stage I and stage II seminoma, but another study adds to the evidence that adjuvant carboplatin may be an acceptable alternative in stage I disease. Surgical studies suggest that even patients with minimal findings on computed tomography after chemotherapy are at risk for harboring vital tumor. Surveillance is shown to be an acceptable choice for highly compliant patients with early stage disease. Risk factors predictive of bleomycin pulmonary toxicity are proposed.

Identification of interaction partners and substrates of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex.,The Journal of biological chemistry,J. Biol. Chem.,2004-05-24,"The CDK2-associated cyclin A1 is essential for spermatogenesis and contributes to leukemogenesis. The detailed molecular functions of cyclin A1 remain unclear, since the molecular networks involving cyclin A1-CDK2 have not been elucidated. Here, we identified novel cyclin A1/CDK2 interaction partners in a yeast triple-hybrid approach. Several novel proteins (INCA1, KARCA1, and PROCA1) as well as the known proteins GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2), Ku70, receptor for activated protein kinase C1/guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-2-like-1, and mRNA-binding motif protein 4 were identified as interaction partners. These proteins link the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex to diverse cellular processes such as DNA repair, signaling, and splicing. Interactions were confirmed by GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation. We cloned and characterized the most frequently isolated unknown gene, which we named INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK interacting with cyclin A1). The nuclear INCA1 protein is evolutionarily conserved and lacks homology to any known gene. This novel protein and two other interacting partners served as substrates for the cyclin A1-CDK2 kinase complex. Cyclin A1 and all interaction partners were highly expressed in testis with varying degrees of tissue specificity. The highest expression levels were observed at different time points during testis maturation, whereas expression levels in germ cell cancers and infertile testes decreased. Taken together, we identified testicular interaction partners of the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex and studied their expression pattern in normal organs, testis development, and testicular malignancies. Thereby, we establish a new basis for future functional analyses of cyclin A1. We provide evidence that the cyclin A1-CDK2 complex plays a role in several signaling pathways important for cell cycle control and meiosis.",Journal Article,5720.0,50.0,CDK2-associated cyclin A1 essential spermatogenesis contributes leukemogenesis detailed molecular functions cyclin A1 remain unclear molecular networks involving cyclin A1-CDK2 elucidated identified novel cyclin A1/CDK2 interaction partners yeast triple-hybrid approach novel INCA1 KARCA1 PROCA1 known GPS2 G-protein pathway suppressor 2 Ku70 receptor activated kinase C1/guanine nucleotide-binding beta-2-like-1 mRNA-binding motif 4 identified interaction partners link cyclin A1-CDK2 complex diverse cellular processes DNA repair signaling splicing Interactions confirmed GST pull-down co-immunoprecipitation cloned characterized frequently isolated unknown named INCA1 inhibitor CDK interacting cyclin A1 nuclear INCA1 evolutionarily conserved lacks homology known novel interacting partners served substrates cyclin A1-CDK2 kinase complex Cyclin A1 interaction partners highly expressed testis varying degrees tissue specificity highest expression levels observed different time points testis maturation expression levels germ infertile testes decreased Taken identified testicular interaction partners cyclin A1-CDK2 complex studied expression pattern normal organs testis development testicular malignancies establish new basis future functional cyclin A1 provide evidence cyclin A1-CDK2 complex plays role signaling pathways important cycle control meiosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4547, 41, 1226, 6044, 16, 1452, 9, 24713, 2, 2444, 6, 5661, 3, 2455, 219, 1681, 1, 1226, 6044, 918, 1200, 1192, 3, 219, 3991, 1267, 1226, 6044, 4547, 47, 44, 85, 3901, 467, 21, 108, 229, 1226, 6044, 4547, 915, 4005, 4, 8, 9962, 1500, 4542, 353, 392, 229, 652, 37691, 54180, 2, 54181, 22, 149, 22, 3, 440, 652, 43615, 499, 178, 308, 1245, 18, 16360, 153, 9, 735, 178, 216, 6801, 10079, 1579, 791, 178, 1090, 18, 733, 14, 2, 956, 791, 5298, 178, 39, 11, 108, 22, 915, 4005, 46, 652, 3460, 3, 1226, 6044, 4547, 840, 6, 1867, 763, 1849, 225, 22, 261, 972, 314, 2, 3895, 1286, 11, 557, 20, 5645, 18171, 1328, 1013, 2, 1269, 4857, 21, 8560, 2, 765, 3, 96, 746, 1355, 860, 145, 92, 21, 8373, 37691, 230, 1, 3954, 5505, 5, 1226, 6044, 3, 928, 37691, 178, 16, 17264, 5547, 2, 6856, 7984, 6, 500, 440, 145, 26, 229, 178, 2, 100, 127, 5505, 4005, 5275, 22, 6063, 9, 3, 1226, 6044, 4547, 216, 840, 1226, 6044, 2, 62, 915, 4005, 11, 561, 570, 4, 5, 2990, 4133, 1, 246, 1121, 3, 1076, 55, 148, 11, 164, 28, 338, 98, 862, 190, 4537, 547, 55, 148, 4, 2280, 31, 163, 2, 23336, 13100, 340, 1633, 1162, 21, 108, 915, 4005, 1, 3, 1226, 6044, 4547, 840, 2, 656, 136, 55, 1177, 4, 295, 2285, 193, 2, 441, 2267, 21, 1811, 8, 217, 877, 9, 508, 583, 318, 1, 1226, 6044, 21, 377, 241, 17, 3, 1226, 6044, 4547, 840, 1698, 8, 200, 4, 392, 314, 460, 305, 9, 31, 417, 182, 2, 33676]",1801.0,15159402,Identification interaction partners substrates cyclin A1-CDK2 complex,0,0.0
Expression of cancer-testis antigens in endometrial carcinomas using a tissue microarray.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2005-01-01,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are expressed in a variety of malignant tumors, but in normal adult tissue, they are only expressed in testicular germ cells. Owing to this tumor-associated expression pattern, these antigens are of major interest as potential targets for immunotherapy and possibly for diagnostic purposes. This study was performed to analyze the expression of four CT antigens, NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, and CT7/MAGE-C1, in endometrial carcinoma using immunohistochemistry, and to correlate expression with histologic subtypes, grade, and expression of WT1 and p53. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 130 endometrial carcinomas of the following types and grades were analyzed using a tissue microarray: 85 endometrioid carcinomas (FIGO grade 1, 39; grade 2, 11; and grade 3, 35), 18 papillary serous carcinomas, 12 clear cell carcinomas, 13 malignant mixed mullerian tumors, one mucinous adenocarcinoma, and one undifferentiated carcinoma. The following anti-CT monoclonal antibodies/antigens were studied by immunohistochemistry: monoclonal antibody ES121/NY-ESO-1, monoclonal antibody M3H67/MAGE-A3, monoclonal antibody 57B/MAGE-A4, and monoclonal antibody CT7-33/CT7. The CT expression data were compared to WT1 and p53 protein expression as analyzed in a previous study. Positive staining with anti-CT monoclonal antibodies was graded as follows: focal, <5% positive cells; 1+, 5-25% cells; 2+, 26-50% cells; 3+, 51-75%; and 4+, >75% cells. The 3+ and 4+ staining patterns were considered homogeneous patterns of potential clinical significance and were scored positive for statistical analysis. In low-grade tumors, the most immunoreactivity was seen with mAb M3H67 but little labeling was observed with the other monoclonal antibodies. In high-grade tumors, monoclonal antibodies M3H67 (25%), 57B (23%), and CT7-33 (20%) showed the highest reactivity, while ES121 showed the lowest immunoreactivity (6%). The staining pattern was mostly heterogeneous. Statistical significance was found solely for the correlation of monoclonal antibody 57B staining and p53 expression. No correlation was found for any anti-CT monoclonal antibody staining and clinical stage or for anti-CT staining and WT1 expression. CT antigens CT7, MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4, but not NY-ESO-1, are expressed in high-grade endometrial carcinomas, and expression of MAGE-A4 is correlated with the presence of overexpressed p53.",Comparative Study,5498.0,25.0,Cancer-testis CT antigens expressed variety malignant normal adult tissue expressed testicular germ Owing tumor-associated expression pattern antigens major potential targets immunotherapy possibly diagnostic purposes performed expression CT antigens NY-ESO-1 MAGE-A3 MAGE-A4 CT7/MAGE-C1 endometrial carcinoma immunohistochemistry correlate expression histologic subtypes grade expression WT1 p53 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues 130 endometrial carcinomas following types grades tissue microarray 85 endometrioid carcinomas FIGO grade 1 39 grade 2 11 grade 3 35 18 papillary serous carcinomas 12 clear carcinomas 13 malignant mixed mullerian mucinous adenocarcinoma undifferentiated carcinoma following anti-CT monoclonal antibodies/antigens studied immunohistochemistry monoclonal antibody ES121/NY-ESO-1 monoclonal antibody M3H67/MAGE-A3 monoclonal antibody 57B/MAGE-A4 monoclonal antibody CT7-33/CT7 CT expression compared WT1 p53 expression previous Positive staining anti-CT monoclonal antibodies graded follows focal 5 positive 1+ 5-25 2+ 26-50 3+ 51-75 4+ 75 3+ 4+ staining patterns considered homogeneous patterns potential clinical significance scored positive statistical low-grade immunoreactivity seen mAb M3H67 little labeling observed monoclonal antibodies high-grade monoclonal antibodies M3H67 25 57B 23 CT7-33 20 showed highest reactivity ES121 showed lowest immunoreactivity 6 staining pattern heterogeneous Statistical significance solely correlation monoclonal antibody 57B staining p53 expression correlation anti-CT monoclonal antibody staining clinical stage anti-CT staining WT1 expression CT antigens CT7 MAGE-A3 MAGE-A4 NY-ESO-1 expressed high-grade endometrial carcinomas expression MAGE-A4 correlated presence overexpressed p53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 7697, 425, 1575, 32, 570, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 393, 57, 84, 4, 295, 780, 246, 491, 32, 158, 570, 4, 2280, 37, 3421, 6, 26, 30, 41, 55, 1177, 46, 1575, 32, 1, 458, 1333, 22, 174, 637, 9, 726, 2, 2150, 9, 752, 4624, 26, 45, 10, 173, 6, 1992, 3, 55, 1, 294, 425, 1575, 2906, 3143, 14, 4871, 7024, 4871, 14090, 2, 10331, 4871, 6801, 4, 134, 75, 888, 2, 6, 1513, 55, 5, 884, 814, 88, 2, 55, 1, 3722, 2, 624, 3265, 1959, 2487, 2505, 742, 1, 3431, 826, 1, 3, 366, 630, 2, 2276, 11, 311, 75, 8, 246, 1727, 772, 3151, 826, 3837, 88, 14, 587, 88, 18, 175, 2, 88, 27, 465, 203, 1796, 1744, 826, 133, 885, 31, 826, 233, 393, 1739, 18773, 57, 104, 2391, 449, 2, 104, 4480, 134, 3, 366, 312, 425, 848, 890, 1575, 11, 656, 20, 888, 848, 548, 43667, 2906, 3143, 14, 848, 548, 37733, 4871, 7024, 848, 548, 24442, 4871, 14090, 2, 848, 548, 10331, 466, 10331, 3, 425, 55, 74, 11, 72, 6, 3722, 2, 624, 178, 55, 22, 311, 4, 8, 698, 45, 109, 1029, 5, 312, 425, 848, 890, 10, 3468, 22, 2962, 2137, 33, 109, 37, 14, 33, 243, 37, 18, 432, 212, 37, 27, 725, 481, 2, 39, 481, 37, 3, 27, 2, 39, 1029, 764, 11, 515, 5642, 764, 1, 174, 38, 724, 2, 11, 3179, 109, 9, 1050, 65, 4, 154, 88, 57, 3, 96, 4900, 10, 527, 5, 2780, 37733, 84, 1215, 3383, 10, 164, 5, 3, 127, 848, 890, 4, 64, 88, 57, 848, 890, 37733, 243, 24442, 382, 2, 10331, 466, 179, 224, 3, 1076, 4601, 369, 43667, 224, 3, 2101, 4900, 49, 3, 1029, 1177, 10, 2754, 1564, 1050, 724, 10, 204, 5558, 9, 3, 816, 1, 848, 548, 24442, 1029, 2, 624, 55, 77, 816, 10, 204, 9, 500, 312, 425, 848, 548, 1029, 2, 38, 82, 15, 9, 312, 425, 1029, 2, 3722, 55, 425, 1575, 10331, 4871, 7024, 2, 4871, 14090, 84, 44, 2906, 3143, 14, 32, 570, 4, 64, 88, 826, 2, 55, 1, 4871, 14090, 16, 438, 5, 3, 463, 1, 1711, 624]",2291.0,15272278,Expression cancer-testis antigens endometrial carcinomas tissue microarray,2,0.006779661016949152
Expression profiling reveals novel pathways in the transformation of melanocytes to melanomas.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2004-08-01,"Affymetrix and spotted oligonucleotide microarrays were used to assess global differential gene expression comparing normal human melanocytes with six independent melanoma cell strains from advanced lesions. The data, validated at the protein level for selected genes, confirmed the overexpression in melanoma cells relative to normal melanocytes of several genes in the growth factor/receptor family that confer growth advantage and metastasis. In addition, novel pathways and patterns of associated expression in melanoma cells not reported before emerged, including the following: (a) activation of the NOTCH pathway; (b) increased Twist expression and altered expression of additional transcriptional regulators implicated in embryonic development and epidermal/mesenchymal transition; (c) coordinated activation of cancer/testis antigens; (d) coordinated down-regulation of several immune modulation genes, in particular in the IFN pathways; (e) down-regulation of several genes implicated in membrane trafficking events; and (f) down-regulation of growth suppressors, such as the Prader-Willi gene NECDIN, whose function was confirmed by overexpression of ectopic Flag-necdin. Validation of differential expression using melanoma tissue microarrays showed that reduced ubiquitin COOH-terminal esterase L1 in primary melanoma is associated with worse outcome and that increased expression of the basic helix-loop-helix protein Twist is associated with worse outcome.

Targeting the androgen receptor: improving outcomes for castration-resistant prostate cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2004-09-01,"The categorization of prostate cancers that are progressing after castration as 'hormone-refractory' evolved from the clinical observation that surgical or medical castration (i.e. androgen ablation therapy; AAT) is not curative and, despite an initial response, virtually all tumors eventually regrow. Successful AAT is contingent on the dependence of prostate cancer cells for androgen signaling through an intracellular mediator, the androgen receptor (AR) for survival. Current preclinical and clinical data imply that the AR is expressed and continues to mediate androgen signaling after failure of AAT. As AAT does not completely eliminate circulating androgens, sufficient concentrations of dihydrotestosterone may accumulate in tumor cells to maintain AR signaling, especially in the context of upregulated receptor levels or increased sensitivity of the AR for activation. In addition, ligands of non-testicular origin or ligand-independent activation can contribute to continued AR signaling. In many cases, therefore, from the perspective of the AR, a 'hormone-refractory' classification after failure of AAT is inappropriate. Classifying prostate tumors that progress after AAT as 'castration-resistant' may be more relevant. Clinical responses to second- and third-line hormonal therapies suggest that the mechanisms of AR activation are in part a function of previously administered AAT. Accordingly, the increasing trend to utilize AAT earlier in the course of the clinical disease may have a greater influence on the genotype and phenotype of the resistant tumor. In this article, we detail strategies to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells that specifically target the AR in addition to those practiced traditionally that indirectly target the receptor by reducing the amount of circulating ligand. We propose that treatment regimes combining AAT with direct AR targeting strategies may provide a more complete blockade of androgen signaling, thereby preventing or significantly delaying the emergence of treatment-resistant disease.",Journal Article,5620.0,180.0,categorization prostate progressing castration 'hormone-refractory evolved clinical observation surgical medical castration i.e androgen ablation therapy AAT curative despite initial response virtually eventually regrow Successful AAT contingent dependence prostate androgen signaling intracellular mediator androgen receptor AR survival Current preclinical clinical imply AR expressed continues mediate androgen signaling failure AAT AAT completely eliminate circulating androgens sufficient concentrations dihydrotestosterone accumulate maintain AR signaling especially context upregulated receptor levels increased sensitivity AR activation addition ligands non-testicular origin ligand-independent activation contribute continued AR signaling cases perspective AR 'hormone-refractory classification failure AAT inappropriate Classifying prostate progress AAT 'castration-resistant relevant Clinical responses second- third-line hormonal therapies suggest mechanisms AR activation function previously administered AAT Accordingly increasing trend utilize AAT earlier course clinical disease greater influence genotype phenotype resistant article strategies inhibit growth prostate specifically target AR addition practiced traditionally indirectly target receptor reducing circulating ligand propose treatment regimes combining AAT direct AR targeting strategies provide complete blockade androgen signaling preventing significantly delaying emergence treatment-resistant disease,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 8872, 1, 163, 17, 32, 4527, 50, 1517, 22, 37765, 430, 3937, 29, 3, 38, 1664, 17, 221, 15, 484, 1517, 70, 563, 687, 1650, 36, 19665, 16, 44, 1075, 2, 550, 35, 388, 51, 5860, 62, 57, 3124, 28162, 1401, 19665, 16, 15270, 23, 3, 3721, 1, 12, 37, 9, 687, 314, 298, 35, 2087, 3810, 3, 687, 153, 754, 9, 25, 291, 693, 2, 38, 74, 8360, 17, 3, 754, 16, 570, 2, 2274, 6, 3367, 687, 314, 50, 496, 1, 19665, 22, 19665, 1097, 44, 2500, 4964, 1033, 5488, 1952, 1003, 1, 7529, 68, 7859, 4, 30, 37, 6, 3040, 754, 314, 1093, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 2684, 153, 148, 15, 101, 485, 1, 3, 754, 9, 363, 4, 352, 3123, 1, 220, 33267, 1938, 15, 1232, 306, 363, 122, 1248, 6, 1351, 754, 314, 4, 445, 140, 673, 29, 3, 3727, 1, 3, 754, 8, 37765, 430, 947, 50, 496, 1, 19665, 16, 5148, 8681, 57, 17, 1466, 50, 19665, 22, 33732, 436, 68, 40, 80, 867, 38, 253, 6, 419, 2, 1282, 328, 1761, 235, 309, 17, 3, 483, 1, 754, 363, 32, 4, 760, 8, 343, 1, 373, 468, 19665, 4705, 3, 602, 853, 6, 6391, 19665, 1677, 4, 3, 906, 1, 3, 38, 34, 68, 47, 8, 378, 1054, 23, 3, 1183, 2, 1005, 1, 3, 436, 30, 4, 26, 946, 21, 5000, 422, 6, 1433, 3, 129, 1, 12, 37, 17, 1225, 283, 3, 754, 4, 352, 6, 135, 11121, 4206, 17, 7792, 283, 3, 153, 20, 1818, 3, 3108, 1, 1033, 1232, 21, 2548, 17, 24, 18881, 1525, 19665, 5, 1196, 754, 529, 422, 68, 377, 8, 80, 236, 1189, 1, 687, 314, 2267, 3017, 15, 97, 7151, 3, 3397, 1, 24, 436, 34]",1990.0,15369448,Targeting androgen receptor improving outcomes castration-resistant prostate,3,0.010169491525423728
Genetic effects of radiotherapy for childhood cancer: gonadal dose reconstruction.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2004-10-01,"To estimate the doses of radiation to organs of interest during treatment of childhood cancer for use in an epidemiologic study of possible heritable diseases, including birth defects, chromosomal abnormalities, cancer, stillbirth, and neonatal and premature death. The study population was composed of more than 25,000 patients with cancer in Denmark and the United States who were survivors of childhood cancer and subsequently had nearly 6,500 children of their own. Radiation therapy records were sought for the survivors who parented offspring who had adverse pregnancy outcomes (>300 offspring), and for a sample of all survivors in a case-cohort design. The records were imaged and centrally abstracted. Water phantom measurements were made to estimate doses for a wide range of treatments. Mathematical phantoms were used to apply measured results to estimate doses to ovaries, uterus, testes, and pituitary for patients ranging in age from newborn to 25 years. Gonadal shielding, ovarian pinning (oophoropexy), and field blocking were taken into account. Testicular radiation doses ranged from <1 to 700 cGy (median, 7 cGy) and ovarian doses from <1 to >2,500 cGy (median, 13 cGy). Ten percent of the records were incomplete, but sufficient data were available for broad characterizations of gonadal dose. More than 49% of the gonadal doses were >10 cGy and 16% were >100 cGy. Sufficient radiation therapy data exist as far back as 1943 to enable computation of gonadal doses administered for curative therapy for childhood cancer. The range of gonadal doses is broad, and for many cancer survivors, is high and just below the threshold for infertility. Accordingly, the epidemiologic study has >90% power to detect a 1.3-fold risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome associated with radiation exposure to the gonads.

Identification of cancer-testis genes expressed by melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma using bioinformatics.,Cancer immunity,Cancer Immun.,2005-02-01,"Cancer-testis or germ cell antigens (GCAs) are a category of tumor antigens expressed by male germ cells and by cancers of diverse histological origin, but not usually by normal adult somatic tissue. These antigens include products encoded by the MAGE, BAGE, GAGE, SSX, and LAGE/NY-ESO-1 families that encode antigenic peptides recognized by T lymphocytes. In this study, we exploit oligonucleotide technology to identify genes in melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) that display a cancer-testis/GCA expression profile. We identified 59 such genes, including GCAs we knew to be recognized by T lymphocytes. Among our findings are the expression of PRAME in monophasic synovial sarcoma, PRAME and NY-ESO-1 in myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, and SSX2 and members of the GAGE family in malignant fibrous histiocytoma.

Prolonged survival following salvage surgery for chemorefractory ovarian immature teratoma: a case report and review of the literature.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-03-01,"Data regarding salvage surgery for ovarian immature teratoma (IT) are lacking despite its established role in the management of chemorefractory testicular germ cell tumors. In this report, a case of advanced IT that was salvaged by secondary cytoreduction following failure of both primary therapy and salvage chemotherapy is described, and the available literature is reviewed. A 28-year-old patient underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy for stage IIIC, grade 3, ovarian IT. Second-line chemotherapy was administered after residual disease was identified at second-look surgery. Following failure of salvage chemotherapy, aggressive secondary debulking resulted in long-term disease-free survival of over 48 months. There appears to be a distinct role for salvage surgery in selected cases of chemorefractory IT.

"MAGE-A1-, MAGE-A10-, and gp100-derived peptides are immunogenic when combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and montanide ISA-51 adjuvant and administered as part of a multipeptide vaccine for melanoma.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2005-03-01,"Twelve peptides derived from melanocyte differentiation proteins and cancer-testis Ags were combined and administered in a single mixture to patients with resected stage IIB, III, or IV melanoma. Five of the 12 peptides included in this mixture had not previously been evaluated for their immunogenicity in vivo following vaccination. We report in this study that at least three of these five peptides (MAGE-A1(96-104), MAGE-A10(254-262), and gp100(614-622)) are immunogenic when administered with GM-CSF in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. T cells secreting IFN-gamma in response to peptide-pulsed target cells were detected in peripheral blood and in the sentinel immunized node, the node draining a vaccine site, after three weekly injections. The magnitude of response typically reached a maximum after two vaccines, and though sometimes diminished thereafter, those responses typically were still detectable 6 wks after the last vaccines. Most importantly, tumor cell lines expressing the appropriate HLA-A restriction element and MAGE-A1, MAGE-A10, or gp100 proteins were lysed by corresponding CTL. This report supports the continued use of the MAGE-A1(96-104), MAGE-A10(254-262), and gp100(614-622) epitopes in peptide-based melanoma vaccines and thus expands the list of immunogenic peptide Ags available for human use. Cancer-testis Ags are expressed in multiple types of cancer; thus the MAGE-A1(96-104) and MAGE-A10(254-262) peptides may be considered for inclusion in vaccines against cancers of other histologic types, in addition to melanoma.",Comparative Study,5439.0,86.0,peptides derived melanocyte differentiation cancer-testis Ags combined administered single mixture patients resected stage IIB III IV melanoma 12 peptides included mixture previously evaluated immunogenicity vivo following vaccination report peptides MAGE-A1 96-104 MAGE-A10 254-262 gp100 614-622 immunogenic administered GM-CSF Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant secreting IFN-gamma response peptide-pulsed target detected peripheral blood sentinel immunized node node draining vaccine site weekly injections magnitude response typically reached maximum vaccines diminished responses typically detectable 6 wks vaccines importantly lines expressing appropriate HLA-A restriction element MAGE-A1 MAGE-A10 gp100 lysed corresponding CTL report supports continued use MAGE-A1 96-104 MAGE-A10 254-262 gp100 614-622 epitopes peptide-based melanoma vaccines expands list immunogenic peptide Ags available human use Cancer-testis Ags expressed multiple types MAGE-A1 96-104 MAGE-A10 254-262 peptides considered inclusion vaccines histologic types addition melanoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2544, 2491, 526, 29, 8564, 910, 652, 2, 12, 7697, 6596, 11, 397, 2, 468, 4, 8, 226, 6972, 6, 7, 5, 1133, 82, 3884, 316, 15, 478, 365, 1, 3, 133, 2491, 159, 4, 26, 6972, 42, 44, 373, 85, 194, 9, 136, 4050, 4, 386, 366, 1915, 21, 414, 4, 26, 45, 17, 28, 506, 169, 1, 46, 365, 2491, 4871, 6044, 921, 3407, 4871, 26368, 7691, 7801, 2, 5322, 13928, 11011, 32, 4190, 198, 468, 5, 2147, 1211, 4, 11309, 14848, 725, 249, 102, 37, 5052, 1256, 1705, 4, 51, 6, 1389, 5695, 283, 37, 11, 530, 4, 672, 315, 2, 4, 3, 1323, 7677, 289, 3, 289, 7535, 8, 1274, 606, 50, 169, 709, 4344, 3, 3131, 1, 51, 1969, 1300, 8, 689, 50, 100, 1842, 2, 2471, 5164, 2849, 3972, 135, 253, 1969, 11, 1234, 2083, 49, 16820, 50, 3, 1060, 1842, 96, 1859, 30, 31, 285, 1046, 3, 870, 1160, 8, 4575, 4467, 2, 4871, 6044, 4871, 26368, 15, 5322, 652, 11, 14098, 20, 1734, 3872, 26, 414, 2304, 3, 1351, 119, 1, 3, 4871, 6044, 921, 3407, 4871, 26368, 7691, 7801, 2, 5322, 13928, 11011, 4915, 4, 1389, 90, 1842, 2, 631, 9365, 3, 4754, 1, 4190, 1389, 6596, 390, 9, 171, 119, 12, 7697, 6596, 32, 570, 4, 232, 630, 1, 12, 631, 3, 4871, 6044, 921, 3407, 2, 4871, 26368, 7691, 7801, 2491, 68, 40, 515, 9, 1680, 4, 1842, 480, 163, 1, 127, 884, 630, 4, 352, 6]",1491.0,15728523,MAGE-A1- MAGE-A10- gp100-derived peptides immunogenic combined granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor montanide ISA-51 adjuvant administered multipeptide vaccine melanoma,0,0.0
Antigens recognized by autologous antibodies of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.,Cancer immunity,Cancer Immun.,2005-03-04,"Serological analysis of recombinant cDNA libraries (SEREX) uses high titer IgGs to identify antigens expressed by autologous cancers. In order to identify tumor antigens in soft tissue sarcoma (STS), sera from four patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), pleomorphic liposarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma were screened against cDNA libraries derived from autologous tumor. We identified 18 antigens encoded by 15 different genes, including DLG7, which is located on chromosome 14q22, a locus previously found to be altered in STS, and the proto-oncogene JUN. Ten of fourteen antigens (71%) do not react with sera from healthy donors, suggesting that antibody recognition takes place during cancer progression. Using oligonucleotide microarray technology, most genes were variably expressed across a panel of 16 benign specimens and 41 STSs of different histologies. DLG7, however, showed restricted expression in testes and cancer, similarly to known germ cell cancer-testis antigens (or germ cell antigens, GCAs). Thus, the current study identified several antigens, including molecules implicated in tumorigenesis that were recognized by high titer IgGs in STS patients. Further studies of these selected novel STS antigens are warranted to identify and characterize potential antigen targets expressed by STS.",Journal Article,5436.0,10.0,Serological recombinant cDNA libraries SEREX uses high titer IgGs identify antigens expressed autologous order identify antigens soft tissue sarcoma STS sera patients malignant fibrous histiocytoma MFH gastrointestinal stromal GIST pleomorphic liposarcoma dedifferentiated liposarcoma screened cDNA libraries derived autologous identified 18 antigens encoded 15 different including DLG7 located chromosome 14q22 locus previously altered STS proto-oncogene JUN fourteen antigens 71 react sera healthy donors suggesting antibody recognition takes place progression oligonucleotide microarray technology variably expressed panel 16 benign specimens 41 STSs different histologies DLG7 showed restricted expression testes similarly known germ cancer-testis antigens germ antigens GCAs current identified antigens including molecules implicated tumorigenesis recognized high titer IgGs STS patients studies selected novel STS antigens warranted identify characterize potential antigen targets expressed STS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[14132, 65, 1, 2835, 4212, 8774, 30303, 4025, 64, 8444, 21311, 6, 255, 1575, 570, 20, 1028, 163, 4, 1732, 6, 255, 30, 1575, 4, 1214, 246, 2230, 4210, 29, 294, 7, 5, 393, 5870, 9960, 6970, 1126, 30, 1394, 4581, 3259, 2, 6275, 3259, 11, 2261, 480, 4212, 8774, 526, 29, 1028, 30, 21, 108, 203, 1575, 4587, 20, 167, 338, 214, 141, 43877, 92, 16, 2308, 23, 1170, 33837, 8, 2474, 373, 204, 6, 40, 1495, 4, 2230, 2, 3, 4976, 1836, 4578, 1618, 1, 3225, 1575, 792, 1022, 44, 11651, 5, 4210, 29, 1331, 2344, 802, 17, 548, 2335, 8512, 3536, 190, 12, 91, 75, 4727, 1727, 2033, 96, 214, 11, 10184, 570, 716, 8, 993, 1, 245, 1002, 623, 2, 605, 14213, 1, 338, 3489, 43877, 137, 224, 2016, 55, 4, 13100, 2, 12, 1813, 6, 440, 2280, 31, 12, 7697, 1575, 15, 2280, 31, 1575, 30720, 631, 3, 291, 45, 108, 392, 1575, 141, 1598, 1771, 4, 1565, 17, 11, 1904, 20, 64, 8444, 21311, 4, 2230, 7, 195, 94, 1, 46, 715, 229, 2230, 1575, 32, 1197, 6, 255, 2, 1507, 174, 448, 637, 570, 20, 2230]",1309.0,15745419,Antigens recognized autologous antibodies patients soft tissue sarcoma,0,0.0
Adolescent survivors: a secondary analysis of a clinical trial targeting behavior change.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2005-08-01,"The late effects of radiation and chemotherapy increase childhood cancer survivors' risk of chronic health problems. Survivors' behavior is important in modifying this risk, yet adolescent and young adult survivors fail to engage in important health-promoting behaviors and frequently practice high-risk behaviors. This secondary analysis re-evaluated a multi-component behavior-change intervention that had previously demonstrated no impact in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. The parent trial compared 132 adolescent survivors in the intervention arm with 135 in the standard-care arm at baseline and at 1 year for disease and treatment knowledge, perception of late effects risk, and the frequency of health-risk and health-protective behaviors (combined as a single summative measure). In contrast, the secondary analysis examined each of the 14 behaviors separately. Additionally, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to examine the change in health behaviors while statistically controlling for age, gender, and the wide variation in baseline behaviors. Knowledge (P = 0.038), breast self-examination (BSE) (P < or = 0.0001) and testicular self-examination (P = 0.004) increased, as did perceptions about the need to change behavior (P = 0.004) and the effort needed to stay healthy (P < or = 0.0001).

Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer: impact of patient selection factors on outcome.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"To investigate the impact of patient selection criteria on the outcome of patients with nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer (NSGCT) treated by primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Since 1999, our criteria have excluded patients with persistent postorchiectomy elevation of serum tumor markers (STM) or clinical stage (CS) IIB disease from RPLND. Between 1989 and 2002, 453 patients underwent primary RPLND at our institution for CS I to IIB NSGCT. Patient information was obtained from a prospective database. Retroperitoneal pathology and relapse rates were compared for patients treated before and after application of the current selection criteria in 1999. By excluding patients with elevated STM or CS IIB disease after 1999, the proportion of pathologic stage II patients with low-volume (pN1) retroperitoneal disease increased significantly (40% before 1999 v 64% after 1999; P = .01), without significantly affecting the rate of retroperitoneal teratoma (21% v 22%, respectively; P = .89) or pathologic stage I disease (56% v 67%, respectively; P = .06). For patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the 4-year progression-free probability improved significantly from 83% before 1999 (95% CI, 79% to 88%) to 96% after 1999 (95% CI, 91% to 100%; P = .005). Elevated postorchiectomy STM (P < .0001), clinical stage (P = .0002), and pre-1999 RPLND (P = .05) were independent pretreatment predictors of progression. Excluding patients with CS IIB disease or elevated postorchiectomy STM from primary RPLND has had a favorable impact on the extent of retroperitoneal disease and has significantly reduced the risk of relapse after RPLND. For patients with normal STM and CS I to IIA disease, the low rate of systemic progression and 22% incidence of retroperitoneal teratoma supports RPLND as the preferred primary intervention.",Journal Article,5408.0,143.0,investigate impact patient selection criteria outcome patients nonseminomatous germ testicular NSGCT treated primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection RPLND 1999 criteria excluded patients persistent postorchiectomy elevation serum markers STM clinical stage CS IIB disease RPLND 1989 2002 453 patients underwent primary RPLND institution CS IIB NSGCT Patient information obtained prospective database Retroperitoneal pathology relapse rates compared patients treated application current selection criteria 1999 excluding patients elevated STM CS IIB disease 1999 proportion pathologic stage II patients low-volume pN1 retroperitoneal disease increased significantly 40 1999 v 64 1999 P .01 significantly affecting rate retroperitoneal teratoma 21 v 22 respectively P .89 pathologic stage disease 56 v 67 respectively P .06 patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy 4-year progression-free probability improved significantly 83 1999 95 CI 79 88 96 1999 95 CI 91 100 P .005 Elevated postorchiectomy STM P .0001 clinical stage P .0002 pre-1999 RPLND P .05 independent pretreatment predictors progression Excluding patients CS IIB disease elevated postorchiectomy STM primary RPLND favorable impact extent retroperitoneal disease significantly reduced risk relapse RPLND patients normal STM CS IIA disease low rate systemic progression 22 incidence retroperitoneal teratoma supports RPLND preferred primary intervention,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 963, 3, 345, 1, 69, 881, 371, 23, 3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 8052, 2280, 31, 12, 8134, 73, 20, 86, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 5022, 1192, 2043, 114, 371, 47, 1800, 7, 5, 1882, 21326, 3292, 1, 524, 30, 525, 20338, 15, 38, 82, 2188, 3884, 34, 29, 5022, 59, 3965, 2, 1544, 9861, 7, 208, 86, 5022, 28, 114, 731, 9, 2188, 70, 6, 3884, 8134, 69, 487, 10, 683, 29, 8, 482, 609, 2591, 1117, 2, 429, 151, 11, 72, 9, 7, 73, 348, 2, 50, 1581, 1, 3, 291, 881, 371, 4, 2043, 20, 3207, 7, 5, 804, 20338, 15, 2188, 3884, 34, 50, 2043, 3, 920, 1, 510, 82, 215, 7, 5, 154, 433, 7945, 2591, 34, 101, 97, 327, 348, 2043, 603, 660, 50, 2043, 19, 355, 187, 97, 2319, 3, 116, 1, 2591, 4845, 239, 603, 350, 106, 19, 887, 15, 510, 82, 70, 34, 664, 603, 598, 106, 19, 1460, 9, 7, 54, 205, 44, 560, 249, 56, 3, 39, 111, 91, 115, 1320, 231, 97, 29, 852, 348, 2043, 48, 58, 842, 6, 889, 6, 921, 50, 2043, 48, 58, 970, 6, 394, 19, 1614, 804, 21326, 20338, 19, 488, 38, 82, 19, 3531, 2, 671, 2043, 5022, 19, 474, 11, 306, 1194, 674, 1, 91, 3207, 7, 5, 2188, 3884, 34, 15, 804, 21326, 20338, 29, 86, 5022, 71, 42, 8, 913, 345, 23, 3, 1039, 1, 2591, 34, 2, 71, 97, 405, 3, 43, 1, 429, 50, 5022, 9, 7, 5, 295, 20338, 2, 2188, 70, 6, 4088, 34, 3, 154, 116, 1, 403, 91, 2, 350, 287, 1, 2591, 4845, 2304, 5022, 22, 3, 2514, 86, 788]",1776.0,15837993,Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection nonseminomatous germ testicular impact patient selection factors outcome,6,0.020338983050847456
"Survival, persistence, and progressive differentiation of adoptively transferred tumor-reactive T cells associated with tumor regression.","Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",J. Immunother.,,"Objective clinical responses have been observed in approximately 50% of patients who received non-myeloablative chemotherapy prior to the adoptive transfer of autologous melanoma-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Recent studies carried out through the use of antibodies directed against T-cell-receptor beta chain variable region (TRBV) products, as well as by direct sequencing of the expressed TRBV gene products, indicated that clinical responses in this trial were associated with the level of persistence of adoptively transferred T cells. In an attempt to further characterize T cells that persist in vivo following adoptive transfer, five dominant T-cell clonotypes were identified in TIL 2035, an adoptively transferred TIL that was associated with the complete regression of multiple metastases. The most highly persistent clonotype, which expressed the BV1 TR gene product, recognized the MAGE-6 cancer/testis antigen in the context of HLA-A23. This clonotype was detected in peripheral blood for over 16 months following adoptive transfer, expressed relatively higher levels of the co-stimulatory markers CD28 and CD27, and possessed telomeres that were long relative to other clonotypes present in TIL 2035 that showed only short-term persistence. The long-term persistent BV1 clonotype appeared to differentiate more slowly toward an end-stage effector in vivo than short-term persistent clonotypes, as manifested by the downregulation of CD28, CD27, and CD45RO and upregulation of CD57 and CD45RA expression on these T cells. These results indicated that the differentiation stage and replicative history of individual TIL clonotypes might be associated with their ability to survive and to persist in vivo, and progressive differentiation of the persistent clonotypes occurred following adoptive transfer.",Journal Article,,148.0,Objective clinical responses observed approximately 50 patients received non-myeloablative chemotherapy prior adoptive transfer autologous melanoma-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes TILs Recent studies carried use antibodies directed T-cell-receptor beta chain variable region TRBV products direct sequencing expressed TRBV products indicated clinical responses trial associated level persistence adoptively transferred attempt characterize persist vivo following adoptive transfer dominant T-cell clonotypes identified TIL 2035 adoptively transferred TIL associated complete regression multiple metastases highly persistent clonotype expressed BV1 TR product recognized MAGE-6 cancer/testis antigen context HLA-A23 clonotype detected peripheral blood 16 months following adoptive transfer expressed relatively higher levels co-stimulatory markers CD28 CD27 possessed telomeres long relative clonotypes present TIL 2035 showed short-term persistence long-term persistent BV1 clonotype appeared differentiate slowly end-stage effector vivo short-term persistent clonotypes manifested downregulation CD28 CD27 CD45RO upregulation CD57 CD45RA expression indicated differentiation stage replicative history individual TIL clonotypes associated ability survive persist vivo progressive differentiation persistent clonotypes occurred following adoptive transfer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[461, 38, 253, 47, 85, 164, 4, 705, 212, 1, 7, 54, 103, 220, 3246, 56, 324, 6, 3, 3159, 2602, 1, 1028, 4128, 2163, 30, 2097, 1594, 3740, 435, 94, 2629, 1205, 298, 3, 119, 1, 890, 1166, 480, 102, 31, 153, 1090, 1260, 1347, 1053, 23436, 2766, 22, 149, 22, 20, 1196, 615, 1, 3, 570, 23436, 145, 2766, 1103, 17, 38, 253, 4, 26, 160, 11, 41, 5, 3, 301, 1, 4108, 1, 8269, 4747, 102, 37, 4, 35, 3448, 6, 195, 1507, 102, 37, 17, 5589, 4, 386, 366, 3159, 2602, 365, 2156, 102, 31, 17308, 11, 108, 4, 3387, 24791, 35, 8269, 4747, 3387, 17, 10, 41, 5, 3, 236, 320, 1, 232, 196, 3, 96, 561, 1882, 30760, 92, 570, 3, 43934, 7161, 145, 2821, 1904, 3, 4871, 49, 12, 7697, 448, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 1160, 54745, 26, 30760, 10, 530, 4, 672, 315, 9, 252, 245, 53, 366, 3159, 2602, 570, 1352, 142, 148, 1, 3, 1269, 6708, 525, 5603, 2, 8608, 2, 10966, 7220, 17, 11, 319, 580, 6, 127, 17308, 364, 4, 3387, 24791, 17, 224, 158, 978, 337, 4108, 3, 319, 337, 1882, 43934, 30760, 2121, 6, 3723, 80, 7681, 1317, 35, 396, 82, 2070, 4, 386, 76, 978, 337, 1882, 17308, 22, 6023, 20, 3, 2475, 1, 5603, 8608, 2, 11469, 2, 2218, 1, 19703, 2, 14567, 55, 23, 46, 102, 37, 46, 99, 1103, 17, 3, 910, 82, 2, 14529, 532, 1, 797, 3387, 17308, 822, 40, 41, 5, 136, 801, 6, 4573, 2, 6, 5589, 4, 386, 2, 1014, 910, 1, 3, 1882, 17308, 489, 366, 3159, 2602]",1810.0,15838383,Survival persistence progressive differentiation adoptively transferred tumor-reactive associated regression,0,0.0
Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with low stage testicular cancer with embryonal carcinoma predominance and/or lymphovascular invasion.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2005-08-01,"The outcome after primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) was analyzed in patients with clinical stage I-IIA nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer with embryonal carcinoma predominance (ECP) or lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Between 1989 and 2002, 267 patients with clinical stage I-IIA nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer, and ECP and/or LVI underwent RPLND. Patient information was obtained from a prospective database. Median followup was 53 months. Overall 42% of patients had pathological stage (PS) II disease, of whom 54% had low volume (PN1) disease and 16% had retroperitoneal teratoma. The 5-year progression-free probability was 90% overall, 90% for PS I and 86% for PN1. All patients with relapse were continuously free of disease following standard chemotherapy with or without resection of residual masses and the 10-year actuarial overall survival was 100%. When adjuvant chemotherapy was restricted to patients with PN2 disease, the estimated 5-year relapse rate was 9% and an estimated 72% of patients avoided chemotherapy. The low risk of systemic relapse in patients with PS I and PN1 after RPLND alone combined with the 16% incidence of retroperitoneal teratoma and the favorable morbidity profile supports RPLND over primary chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with low stage disease with ECP and/or LVI who are not candidates for surveillance. An estimated 72% of patients are spared the potential toxicity of chemotherapy if adjuvant therapy is restricted to patients with PN2.

A recent randomized trial found tumor size and rete testis invasion to be the strongest predictors of relapse in clinical stage I seminomas. These 2 parameters may be surrogate measures of tumor volume. Intertubular seminoma (ITS) of the testis describes the presence of neoplastic germ cells within the interstitium of the testis. These cells are detected away from the main macroscopic mass. Because ITS can infiltrate in a 3-dimensional fashion, it may also represent a measure of tumor volume not usually noted in standard pathology reporting. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of ITS in pure seminomas and its association with other prognostic parameters. One hundred twenty consecutive pure seminomas surgically removed between 1998 and 2003 were evaluated. ITS was defined as the presence of an interstitial or intertubular growth pattern of tumor cells, which was noncontiguous with the main tumor and present at least 3 high-power fields away from the tumor mass. The average tumor size was 3.4 cm. Of the entire cohort of patients, which included pathological stages T1 through T3, 11% had invasion through the tunica albuginea, 51% had rete testis invasion, 51% had lymphovascular invasion, 93% had associated intratubular germ-cell neoplasia, and 36% had ITS. ITS was significantly associated with rete testis invasion ( P = .001). Logistic regression analysis looking at ITS, tumor size, patient age, and lymphovascular invasion revealed that only ITS was associated with rete testis invasion (RR, 4.1, P < .0001). ITS is present in a significant proportion of pure seminomas and has a significant association with rete testis invasion. The presence of ITS may therefore be an important prognostic factor, not only because it alters the calculated size of the tumor but also because it has an association with rete testis invasion.",Journal Article,5347.0,15.0,Clinical stage seminomas effectively treated surgery raising concerns adjuvant radiation therapy given risk secondary malignancies recent randomized trial size rete testis invasion strongest predictors relapse clinical stage seminomas 2 parameters surrogate measures volume Intertubular seminoma testis describes presence neoplastic germ interstitium testis detected away main macroscopic mass infiltrate 3-dimensional fashion represent measure volume usually noted standard pathology reporting goal determine incidence pure seminomas association prognostic parameters consecutive pure seminomas surgically removed 1998 2003 evaluated defined presence interstitial intertubular growth pattern noncontiguous main present 3 high-power fields away mass average size 3.4 cm entire cohort patients included pathological stages T1 T3 11 invasion tunica albuginea 51 rete testis invasion 51 lymphovascular invasion 93 associated intratubular germ-cell neoplasia 36 significantly associated rete testis invasion P .001 Logistic regression looking size patient age lymphovascular invasion revealed associated rete testis invasion RR 4.1 P .0001 present significant proportion pure seminomas significant association rete testis invasion presence important prognostic factor alters calculated size association rete testis invasion,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[38, 82, 70, 11092, 32, 1856, 73, 5, 152, 6627, 2061, 22, 6, 198, 6, 4978, 249, 121, 36, 447, 3, 43, 1, 568, 441, 8, 435, 384, 160, 204, 30, 444, 2, 24836, 578, 6, 40, 3, 3311, 674, 1, 429, 4, 38, 82, 70, 11092, 46, 18, 1038, 68, 40, 2592, 1018, 1, 30, 433, 44033, 6930, 211, 1, 3, 2677, 3, 463, 1, 2000, 2280, 37, 262, 3, 22307, 1, 3, 46, 37, 32, 530, 6565, 29, 3, 1895, 5897, 782, 408, 211, 122, 5172, 4, 8, 27, 2201, 3240, 192, 68, 120, 1231, 8, 1463, 1, 30, 433, 44, 2082, 1051, 4, 260, 1117, 1760, 3, 1326, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 287, 1, 211, 4, 3092, 11092, 2, 211, 248, 5, 127, 177, 1038, 104, 1128, 737, 935, 3092, 11092, 2350, 2264, 59, 1850, 2, 1522, 11, 194, 211, 10, 395, 22, 3, 463, 1, 35, 4543, 15, 44033, 129, 1177, 1, 30, 37, 92, 10, 28108, 5, 3, 1895, 30, 2, 364, 28, 506, 27, 64, 2349, 3130, 6565, 29, 3, 30, 782, 3, 1011, 30, 444, 10, 27, 39, 494, 1, 3, 1797, 180, 1, 7, 92, 159, 1301, 1153, 1534, 298, 2065, 175, 42, 578, 298, 3, 33925, 54947, 725, 42, 24836, 578, 725, 42, 2933, 578, 966, 42, 41, 44034, 2280, 31, 2298, 2, 511, 42, 211, 211, 10, 97, 41, 5, 24836, 578, 19, 144, 812, 320, 65, 9095, 28, 211, 30, 444, 69, 89, 2, 2933, 578, 553, 17, 158, 211, 10, 41, 5, 24836, 578, 861, 39, 14, 19, 488, 211, 16, 364, 4, 8, 93, 920, 1, 3092, 11092, 2, 71, 8, 93, 248, 5, 24836, 578, 3, 463, 1, 211, 68, 673, 40, 35, 305, 177, 161, 44, 158, 408, 192, 6745, 3, 981, 444, 1, 3, 30, 84, 120, 408, 192, 71, 35, 248, 5, 24836, 578]",1932.0,16021570,Intertubular growth pure seminomas associations poor prognostic parameters,0,0.0

Pharmacodynamic properties of methotrexate and Aminotrexate during weekly therapy.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother.

We compared the pharmacodynamic properties of AMT (given orally at 4 mg/m2 in two divided doses per week) and MTX (100 mg/m2 in four divided doses per week) among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We find AMT and MTX to have equivalent penetration into the bone marrow compartment of these patients, as indicated by the steady-state concentrations within mature red blood cells (RBCs). However, MTX concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid after oral dosage are significantly greater than AMT. To confirm these clinical observations, mice were treated four weekly injections of AMT or MTX, at a 1:20 dosage ratio, and tissue antifolate content was then determined over the subsequent 22 days. We confirm the selective exclusion of AMT from the CNS compartment, while showing equivalent accumulation of AMT and MTX in the RBCs, liver, spleen, kidneys and testes. Finally, we demonstrate that AMT, MTX, and their predominant polyglutamate species are equipotent inhibitors of their target intracellular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, emphasizing the critical nature of steady-state tissue accumulation in determining the relative cytotoxic potency of these two antifolates.",Comparative Study,5239.0,22.0,4-Amino-pteroyl-glutamic acid Aminotrexate AMT advantages related antifolate methotrexate MTX including greater potency complete oral bioavailability greater accumulation leukemic blasts vitro compared pharmacodynamic properties AMT given orally 4 mg/m2 divided doses week MTX 100 mg/m2 divided doses week children acute lymphoblastic leukemia AMT MTX equivalent penetration bone marrow compartment patients indicated steady-state concentrations mature red blood RBCs MTX concentrations cerebrospinal fluid oral dosage significantly greater AMT confirm clinical observations mice treated weekly injections AMT MTX 1:20 dosage ratio tissue antifolate content determined subsequent 22 days confirm selective exclusion AMT CNS compartment showing equivalent accumulation AMT MTX RBCs liver spleen kidneys testes Finally demonstrate AMT MTX predominant polyglutamate species equipotent inhibitors target intracellular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase emphasizing critical nature steady-state tissue accumulation determining relative cytotoxic potency antifolates,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[39, 3078, 43558, 12727, 971, 55083, 5383, 71, 392, 3126, 252, 3, 139, 12278, 2116, 3453, 141, 378, 3593, 236, 518, 5499, 2, 378, 1835, 20, 2015, 2438, 4, 439, 21, 72, 3, 2424, 1571, 1, 5383, 447, 1428, 28, 39, 81, 821, 4, 100, 2176, 415, 379, 647, 2, 3453, 394, 81, 821, 4, 294, 2176, 415, 379, 647, 107, 541, 5, 286, 1275, 21, 2469, 5383, 2, 3453, 6, 47, 2017, 4618, 237, 3, 581, 3616, 1, 46, 7, 22, 1103, 20, 3, 4152, 1309, 1003, 262, 2908, 3422, 315, 37, 15859, 137, 3453, 1003, 4, 3, 5156, 2357, 50, 518, 3323, 32, 97, 378, 76, 5383, 6, 1843, 46, 38, 2172, 399, 11, 73, 294, 709, 4344, 1, 5383, 15, 3453, 28, 8, 14, 179, 3323, 197, 2, 246, 12278, 2457, 10, 818, 509, 252, 3, 706, 350, 162, 21, 1843, 3, 1094, 4721, 1, 5383, 29, 3, 1025, 3616, 369, 2069, 2017, 1835, 1, 5383, 2, 3453, 4, 3, 15859, 4071, 7143, 2, 13100, 1368, 21, 608, 17, 5383, 3453, 2, 136, 2750, 22006, 2915, 32, 23478, 222, 1, 136, 283, 2087, 1644, 20298, 4027, 6826, 3, 740, 2202, 1, 4152, 1309, 246, 1835, 4, 2196, 3, 580, 759, 3593, 1, 46, 100, 14893]",1362.0,16170572,Pharmacodynamic properties methotrexate Aminotrexate weekly therapy,0,0.0

Late relapse of testicular germ cell tumors.,Urologic oncology,Urol. Oncol.,,"The successful multidisciplinary approach for the management of germ cell tumors of the testis has resulted in survival rates of greater than 90% overall. While the majority of relapses in patients with germ cell tumors occur within the first 2 years of treatment, the incidence of late relapse beyond 2 years has been increasing over recent years. The pattern of late relapse suggests that an inadequately controlled retroperitoneum is a major predisposing factor, with up to 80% of late relapses occurring in the retroperitoneum.

Molecular biology of malignant mesothelioma: a review.,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am.,2005-12-01,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an uncommon tumor with high mortality and morbidity rates. It arises from mesothelial cells that line the pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, and testicular cavities. This is a disease with an indolent course because tumors arise 20 to 40 years after exposure to an inciting agent. Extensive research has shown that mesothelial cells are transformed into MM cells through various chromosomal and cellular pathway defects. These changes alter the normal cells' ability to survive, proliferate, and metastasize. This article discusses the alterations that occur in transforming normal mesothelial cells into MM. It also details some of the signal transduction pathways that seem to be important in MM with the potential for novel targeted therapeutics.",Journal Article,5164.0,16.0,Malignant mesothelioma MM uncommon high mortality morbidity rates arises mesothelial line pleural pericardial peritoneal testicular cavities disease indolent course arise 20 40 years exposure inciting agent Extensive research shown mesothelial transformed MM chromosomal cellular pathway defects changes alter normal ability survive proliferate metastasize article discusses alterations occur transforming normal mesothelial MM details signal transduction pathways important MM potential novel targeted therapeutics,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[393, 321, 16, 35, 2052, 30, 5, 64, 282, 2, 787, 151, 192, 6053, 29, 10308, 37, 17, 328, 3, 2164, 6657, 1639, 2, 11982, 26, 16, 8, 34, 5, 35, 2316, 906, 408, 57, 3043, 179, 6, 327, 60, 50, 645, 6, 35, 30881, 420, 1344, 389, 71, 443, 17, 10308, 37, 32, 2423, 237, 321, 37, 298, 747, 1860, 2, 763, 308, 2945, 46, 400, 2688, 3, 295, 37, 801, 6, 4573, 9554, 2, 5769, 26, 946, 2759, 3, 593, 17, 1271, 4, 3621, 295, 10308, 37, 237, 321, 192, 120, 3791, 476, 1, 3, 1235, 2761, 460, 17, 3233, 6, 40, 305, 4, 321, 5, 3, 174, 9, 229, 238, 1943]",740.0,16325120,Molecular malignant mesothelioma review,2,0.006779661016949152
The Y deletion gr/gr and susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumor.,American journal of human genetics,Am. J. Hum. Genet.,2005-10-24,"Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is the most common cancer in young men. Despite a considerable familial component to TGCT risk, no genetic change that confers increased risk has been substantiated to date. The human Y chromosome carries a number of genes specifically involved in male germ cell development, and deletion of the AZFc region at Yq11 is the most common known genetic cause of infertility. Recently, a 1.6-Mb deletion of the Y chromosome that removes part of the AZFc region--known as the ""gr/gr"" deletion--has been associated with infertility. In epidemiological studies, male infertility has shown an association with TGCT that is out of proportion with what can be explained by tumor effects. Thus, we hypothesized that the gr/gr deletion may be associated with TGCT. Using logistic modeling, we analyzed this deletion in a large series of TGCT cases with and without a family history of TGCT. The gr/gr deletion was present in 3.0% (13/431) of TGCT cases with a family history, 2% (28/1,376) of TGCT cases without a family history, and 1.3% (33/2,599) of unaffected males. Presence of the gr/gr deletion was associated with a twofold increased risk of TGCT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.6; P = .005) and a threefold increased risk of TGCT among patients with a positive family history (aOR 3.2; 95% CI 1.5-6.7; P = .0027). The gr/gr deletion was more strongly associated with seminoma (aOR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6-5.4; P = .0004) than with nonseminoma TGCT (aOR 1.5; 95% CI 0.72-3.0; P = .29). These data indicate that the Y microdeletion gr/gr is a rare, low-penetrance allele that confers susceptibility to TGCT.",Comparative Study,5202.0,145.0,"Testicular germ TGCT common young men Despite considerable familial component TGCT risk genetic change confers increased risk substantiated date human chromosome carries number specifically involved male germ development deletion AZFc region Yq11 common known genetic cause infertility Recently 1.6-Mb deletion chromosome removes AZFc region -- known `` gr/gr '' deletion -- associated infertility epidemiological studies male infertility shown association TGCT proportion explained effects hypothesized gr/gr deletion associated TGCT logistic modeling deletion large series TGCT cases family history TGCT gr/gr deletion present 3.0 13/431 TGCT cases family history 2 28/1,376 TGCT cases family history 1.3 33/2,599 unaffected males Presence gr/gr deletion associated twofold increased risk TGCT adjusted odds ratio aOR 2.1 95 confidence interval CI 1.3-3.6 P .005 threefold increased risk TGCT patients positive family history aOR 3.2 95 CI 1.5-6.7 P .0027 gr/gr deletion strongly associated seminoma aOR 3.0 95 CI 1.6-5.4 P .0004 nonseminoma TGCT aOR 1.5 95 CI 0.72-3.0 P .29 indicate microdeletion gr/gr rare low-penetrance allele confers susceptibility TGCT",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2280, 31, 30, 7122, 16, 3, 96, 186, 12, 4, 1169, 325, 550, 8, 2658, 2200, 1249, 6, 7122, 43, 77, 336, 707, 17, 4020, 101, 43, 71, 85, 19599, 6, 1244, 3, 171, 2055, 1170, 4942, 8, 207, 1, 214, 1225, 646, 4, 1045, 2280, 31, 193, 2, 1528, 1, 3, 44195, 1053, 28, 55221, 16, 3, 96, 186, 440, 336, 708, 1, 5901, 761, 8, 14, 49, 2571, 1528, 1, 3, 2055, 1170, 17, 17699, 760, 1, 3, 44195, 1053, 440, 22, 3, 3845, 3845, 522, 1528, 71, 85, 41, 5, 5901, 4, 4614, 94, 1045, 5901, 71, 443, 35, 248, 5, 7122, 17, 16, 1205, 1, 920, 5, 2067, 122, 40, 3672, 20, 30, 176, 631, 21, 1237, 17, 3, 3845, 3845, 1528, 68, 40, 41, 5, 7122, 75, 812, 2057, 21, 311, 26, 1528, 4, 8, 375, 988, 1, 7122, 140, 5, 2, 187, 8, 607, 532, 1, 7122, 3, 3845, 3845, 1528, 10, 364, 4, 27, 13, 233, 10889, 1, 7122, 140, 5, 8, 607, 532, 18, 339, 14, 9534, 1, 7122, 140, 187, 8, 607, 532, 2, 14, 27, 466, 18, 13029, 1, 4585, 2296, 463, 1, 3, 3845, 3845, 1528, 10, 41, 5, 8, 8144, 101, 43, 1, 7122, 586, 610, 197, 3366, 18, 14, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 27, 27, 49, 19, 1614, 2, 8, 10182, 101, 43, 1, 7122, 107, 7, 5, 8, 109, 607, 532, 3366, 27, 18, 48, 58, 14, 33, 49, 67, 19, 15146, 3, 3845, 3845, 1528, 10, 80, 1327, 41, 5, 6930, 3366, 27, 13, 48, 58, 14, 49, 33, 39, 19, 5295, 76, 5, 13643, 7122, 3366, 14, 33, 48, 58, 13, 720, 27, 13, 19, 462, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 3, 2055, 44196, 3845, 3845, 16, 8, 622, 154, 4792, 1254, 17, 4020, 1432, 6, 7122]",1596.0,16380914,deletion gr/gr susceptibility testicular germ,1,0.003389830508474576

We then verified the expression levels of selected genes from the Affymetrix results in a larger number of bladder cancer patients (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 27). Blood gene expression profiles distinguished bladder cancer patients from healthy controls and from testicular and renal cancer patients. Differential expression of a combined set of seven gene transcripts (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, sorting nexin 16, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 6, and cathepsin D, chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2, nell-like 2, and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 7) was able to discriminate bladder cancer from control samples with a sensitivity of 83% (95% confidence interval, 67-93%) and a specificity of 93% (95% confidence interval, 76-99%). We have shown that the gene expression profile of circulating blood cells can distinguish bladder cancer from other types of genitourinary cancer and healthy controls and can be used to identify novel blood markers for bladder cancer.",Journal Article,4982.0,88.0,Recent indicate cDNA microarray expression profile blood reflect disease states diagnostic value tested hypothesis blood expression differentiate bladder genitourinary bladder healthy controls Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip Affymetrix Santa Clara CA profile circulating blood total RNA 35 patients diagnosed types genitourinary bladder n 16 testicular n 10 renal carcinoma n 9 compared cDNA profiles 10 healthy subjects verified expression levels selected Affymetrix larger number bladder patients n 40 healthy controls n 27 Blood expression profiles distinguished bladder patients healthy controls testicular renal patients Differential expression combined set seven transcripts insulin-like growth factor-binding 7 sorting nexin 16 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 6 cathepsin chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 2 nell-like 2 necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 7 able discriminate bladder control sensitivity 83 95 confidence interval 67-93 specificity 93 95 confidence interval 76-99 shown expression profile circulating blood distinguish bladder types genitourinary healthy controls identify novel blood markers bladder,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[435, 74, 1008, 17, 4212, 1727, 145, 55, 800, 1, 315, 37, 122, 2694, 34, 907, 2, 631, 47, 752, 549, 21, 650, 3, 1492, 17, 315, 31, 145, 55, 122, 3723, 59, 12, 2, 127, 4109, 163, 22, 149, 22, 59, 12, 2, 1331, 535, 21, 95, 5318, 17316, 349, 18, 13, 16297, 5318, 19565, 21141, 1568, 6, 800, 1033, 315, 181, 893, 29, 465, 7, 265, 5, 104, 1, 169, 630, 1, 4109, 12, 12, 78, 245, 12, 78, 79, 2, 31, 134, 78, 83, 2, 72, 136, 4212, 1241, 5, 135, 1, 79, 1331, 976, 21, 818, 4815, 3, 55, 148, 1, 715, 214, 29, 3, 5318, 99, 4, 8, 1077, 207, 1, 12, 7, 78, 327, 2, 1331, 535, 78, 428, 315, 145, 55, 1241, 4735, 12, 7, 29, 1331, 535, 2, 29, 2, 12, 7, 1777, 55, 1, 8, 397, 916, 1, 648, 145, 2680, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 791, 178, 67, 6751, 55535, 245, 20468, 6424, 19766, 49, 2, 7892, 427, 30951, 13072, 261, 791, 178, 18, 55536, 733, 18, 2, 30, 1523, 161, 153, 8845, 2693, 67, 10, 1665, 6, 5696, 12, 29, 182, 347, 5, 8, 485, 1, 852, 48, 307, 268, 598, 966, 2, 8, 1121, 1, 966, 48, 307, 268, 846, 1058, 21, 47, 443, 17, 3, 145, 55, 800, 1, 1033, 315, 37, 122, 3081, 12, 29, 127, 630, 1, 4109, 12, 2, 1331, 535, 2, 122, 40, 95, 6, 255, 229, 315, 525, 9, 12]",1540.0,16740760,Novel blood biomarkers human urinary bladder,3,0.010169491525423728
The cancer and leukemia group B pharmacology and experimental therapeutics committee: a historical perspective.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-06-01,"The Chemotherapy Committee of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) was established in the mid-1970s to assemble a group of experts in cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology who could advise the CALGB disease committees about the optimal use of drugs in the fight against cancer and to provide quality assurance for the chemotherapy section of CALGB protocols. Chaired initially by Edward Henderson and then David Van Echo, the committee was also the repository of studies in diseases for which CALGB did not have a formal committee, such as testis cancer and sarcoma. In 1990, following the appointment of Richard Schilsky as Chair, the name of the committee was changed to the Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (PET) Committee to reflect a more specific focus and scientific agenda (i.e., studies of chemotherapy pharmacology and development of new agents). Three PET Committee reference pharmacology laboratories (led by Merrill Egorin, Tony Miller, and Mark Ratain) were established to measure drug concentrations in biological fluids and to perform pharmacokinetic analyses. In addition, the PET Committee embarked on a number of multi-institution phase I studies. These phase I studies included studies of special populations, including the first prospective study of an anticancer agent (paclitaxel) in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In addition, the Committee studied a number of phase I combinations destined for phase II evaluation in disease-specific committees. Following Dr. Schilsky's election as CALGB Group Chair in 1994, Mark Ratain took over as Chair of the PET Committee and continued to emphasize population pharmacology as the primary theme of the Committee's research agenda. In addition, the PET Committee began to develop novel clinical trial designs, including the first completed randomized discontinuation trial of an antineoplastic agent. Most recently, the PET Committee has launched an ambitious research program in pharmacogenetics, facilitated in large part through the recruitment of Howard McLeod as Vice Chair. This area of research is a collaborative effort with the NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network and has the potential to definitively address the hypothesis that germ line polymorphisms are a significant determinant of the toxicity and efficacy of anticancer therapy. It is anticipated that the results of the current studies will contribute significantly to the goal of individualizing cancer treatment.",Historical Article,4982.0,12.0,Chemotherapy Committee Leukemia Group B CALGB established mid-1970s assemble group experts chemotherapy pharmacology advise CALGB disease committees optimal use drugs fight provide quality assurance chemotherapy section CALGB protocols Chaired initially Edward Henderson David Van Echo committee repository studies diseases CALGB formal committee testis sarcoma 1990 following appointment Richard Schilsky Chair committee changed Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics PET Committee reflect specific focus scientific agenda i.e. studies chemotherapy pharmacology development new agents PET Committee reference pharmacology laboratories led Merrill Egorin Tony Miller Mark Ratain established measure drug concentrations fluids perform pharmacokinetic addition PET Committee embarked number multi-institution phase studies phase studies included studies special populations including prospective anticancer agent paclitaxel patients hepatic dysfunction addition Committee studied number phase combinations destined phase II evaluation disease-specific committees Following Dr. Schilsky 's election CALGB Group Chair 1994 Mark Ratain took Chair PET Committee continued emphasize population pharmacology primary theme Committee 's research agenda addition PET Committee began develop novel clinical trial designs including completed randomized discontinuation trial antineoplastic agent recently PET Committee launched ambitious research program pharmacogenetics facilitated large recruitment Howard McLeod Vice Chair area research collaborative effort NIH Pharmacogenetics Research Network potential definitively address hypothesis germ line polymorphisms significant determinant toxicity efficacy anticancer therapy anticipated current studies contribute significantly goal individualizing treatment,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 56, 2002, 1, 12, 2, 87, 132, 4077, 10, 635, 4, 3, 4863, 10868, 6, 18979, 8, 87, 1, 3186, 4, 12, 56, 2, 6852, 54, 359, 12636, 3, 4077, 34, 16045, 545, 3, 665, 119, 1, 600, 4, 3, 12286, 480, 12, 2, 6, 377, 372, 8050, 9, 3, 56, 2917, 1, 4077, 2189, 26501, 1625, 20, 38186, 55540, 2, 818, 26351, 19521, 10430, 3, 2002, 10, 120, 3, 12841, 1, 94, 4, 1342, 9, 92, 4077, 205, 44, 47, 8, 5057, 2002, 225, 22, 12, 2, 4, 2289, 366, 3, 9698, 1, 26349, 38187, 22, 19069, 3, 9812, 1, 3, 2002, 10, 2368, 6, 3, 6852, 2, 1560, 1943, 495, 2002, 6, 2694, 8, 80, 112, 1222, 2, 3138, 12402, 70, 563, 94, 1, 56, 6852, 2, 193, 1, 217, 183, 169, 495, 2002, 2482, 6852, 4884, 836, 20, 55541, 55542, 55543, 23525, 2, 8863, 44371, 11, 635, 6, 1463, 234, 1003, 4, 1037, 9332, 2, 6, 2715, 1456, 318, 4, 352, 3, 495, 2002, 21150, 23, 8, 207, 1, 1414, 731, 124, 70, 94, 46, 124, 70, 94, 159, 94, 1, 3714, 1184, 141, 3, 157, 482, 45, 1, 35, 1475, 420, 490, 4, 7, 5, 939, 1527, 4, 352, 3, 2002, 656, 8, 207, 1, 124, 70, 1247, 19539, 9, 124, 215, 451, 4, 34, 112, 16045, 366, 3436, 38187, 292, 30952, 22, 4077, 87, 19069, 4, 3023, 8863, 44371, 5060, 252, 22, 19069, 1, 3, 495, 2002, 2, 1351, 6, 5560, 266, 6852, 22, 3, 86, 10293, 1, 3, 2002, 292, 389, 12402, 4, 352, 3, 495, 2002, 4603, 6, 690, 229, 38, 160, 4120, 141, 3, 157, 781, 384, 2007, 160, 1, 35, 3940, 420, 96, 761, 3, 495, 2002, 71, 13234, 35, 37474, 389, 1243, 4, 8759, 4667, 4, 375, 760, 298, 3, 3202, 1, 34098, 55544, 22, 10449, 19069, 26, 965, 1, 389, 16, 8, 3737, 2919, 5, 3, 6833, 8759, 389, 1801, 2, 71, 3, 174, 6, 6008, 1539, 3, 1492, 17, 2280, 328, 1203, 32, 8, 93, 4372, 1, 3, 155, 2, 209, 1, 1475, 36, 192, 16, 4078, 17, 3, 99, 1, 3, 291, 94, 303, 1248, 97, 6, 3, 1326, 1, 12747, 12, 24]",2399.0,16740794,leukemia group B pharmacology experimental therapeutics committee historical perspective,0,0.0
Predicting teratoma in the retroperitoneum in men undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2006-07-01,"The biological potential of teratoma remains unpredictable, therefore identifying its presence in the retroperitoneum remains important. We evaluated patients undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors to determine predictors of teratomatous elements in the retroperitoneum. We identified 532 patients from 1989 to 2003 who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection following chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors at our institution. Multiple clinical and pathological variables were reviewed from our prospective retroperitoneal lymph node dissection database. A logistic regression model was designed based on preoperative variables to predict the presence of teratomatous elements in the retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimen. Of the 532 patients in our series 450 (85%) received only induction chemotherapy and 82 (15%) required salvage chemotherapy. Teratomatous elements were identified in the orchiectomy specimen in 42% of patients. Retroperitoneal nodal pathology revealed teratomatous elements in 235 (44%) patients and only teratoma in 210 (40%) patients. By multivariate analysis testicular yolk sac tumor (p = 0.046), teratoma in the orchiectomy specimen (p <0.005), relative change in nodal size before and after chemotherapy (p <0.005), and no requirement for salvage chemotherapy (p = 0.03) were independent predictors for the presence of teratoma in the retroperitoneum. Teratoma remains a common histological finding in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes following chemotherapy. We have identified several pre-retroperitoneal lymph node dissection variables that predict the finding of teratoma in the retroperitoneum for men treated with chemotherapy for metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors.",Journal Article,4952.0,49.0,potential teratoma remains unpredictable identifying presence retroperitoneum remains important evaluated patients undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection nonseminomatous germ determine predictors teratomatous elements retroperitoneum identified 532 patients 1989 2003 underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection following chemotherapy nonseminomatous germ institution Multiple clinical pathological variables reviewed prospective retroperitoneal lymph node dissection database logistic regression model designed based preoperative variables predict presence teratomatous elements retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimen 532 patients series 450 85 received induction chemotherapy 82 15 required salvage chemotherapy Teratomatous elements identified orchiectomy specimen 42 patients Retroperitoneal nodal pathology revealed teratomatous elements 235 44 patients teratoma 210 40 patients multivariate testicular yolk sac p 0.046 teratoma orchiectomy specimen p 0.005 relative change nodal size chemotherapy p 0.005 requirement salvage chemotherapy p 0.03 independent predictors presence teratoma retroperitoneum Teratoma remains common histological finding retroperitoneal lymph nodes following chemotherapy identified pre-retroperitoneal lymph node dissection variables predict finding teratoma retroperitoneum men treated chemotherapy metastatic nonseminomatous germ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1037, 174, 1, 4845, 469, 8907, 673, 1386, 211, 463, 4, 3, 7765, 469, 305, 21, 194, 7, 479, 539, 56, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 9, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 6, 223, 674, 1, 22087, 2531, 4, 3, 7765, 21, 108, 11319, 7, 29, 3965, 6, 1522, 54, 208, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 366, 56, 9, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 28, 114, 731, 232, 38, 2, 1301, 682, 11, 446, 29, 114, 482, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 609, 8, 812, 320, 202, 10, 1114, 90, 23, 498, 682, 6, 678, 3, 463, 1, 22087, 2531, 4, 3, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 2360, 1, 3, 11319, 7, 4, 114, 988, 5669, 772, 103, 158, 504, 56, 2, 878, 167, 616, 992, 56, 22087, 2531, 11, 108, 4, 3, 9377, 2360, 4, 595, 1, 7, 2591, 779, 1117, 553, 22087, 2531, 4, 6465, 584, 7, 2, 158, 4845, 4, 5376, 327, 7, 20, 331, 65, 13078, 7948, 30, 19, 13, 4902, 4845, 4, 3, 9377, 2360, 19, 13, 1614, 580, 707, 4, 779, 444, 348, 2, 50, 56, 19, 13, 1614, 2, 77, 4701, 9, 992, 56, 19, 13, 680, 11, 306, 674, 9, 3, 463, 1, 4845, 4, 3, 7765, 4845, 469, 8, 186, 1831, 1567, 4, 3, 2591, 263, 502, 366, 56, 21, 47, 108, 392, 671, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 682, 17, 678, 3, 1567, 1, 4845, 4, 3, 7765, 9, 325, 73, 5, 56, 9, 113, 8052, 2280, 31, 57]",1750.0,16753380,Predicting teratoma retroperitoneum men undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection,0,0.0
Expression of cancer-testis antigens as possible targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2006-09-09,"Cancer-Testis (CT) antigens are by definition expressed in tumor but not in healthy tissue except testis and might represent ideal targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of CT antigen expression in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Tumor samples (N = 51), and adjacent healthy tissue from patients with HNSCC were analyzed for the expression of 23 genes designated CT antigens using RT-PCR. Patient sera (N = 39) were screened for IgG antibody responses against NY-ESO-1, MAGEA3, and SSX2. According to their expression pattern antigens were divided into four groups. ADAM2, LIP1, SLLP1, AKAP3, CTAGE, ZNF165, CAGE, and FTHL17 were expressed in tumor and healthy tissue at comparable frequencies. NY-TLU-57, GAGE1, SAGE1 were expressed more frequently in tumor samples than in healthy tissues.

Chylous ascites after post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: review of the M. D. Anderson experience.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2006-10-01,"We determined the clinical presentation, risk factors and optimal treatment of chylous ascites that develop after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with testicular cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 329 patients who underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at our institution, of whom 23 (7%) had chylous ascites postoperatively. Clinical and pathological parameters were entered into a database. Mean patient age at chylous ascites presentation was 32.1 years. On univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses increasing amounts of preoperative chemotherapy (OR 1.24) and intraoperative blood loss (OR 1.33) were predictive of chylous ascites. The clinical presentation of chylous ascites consisted of abdominal fullness and distention in all patients. Initial treatment was paracentesis alone or combined with total parenteral nutrition in 77% of patients. An abdominal drain was used for persistent ascites in 10 patients. In patients treated conservatively the rate of resolution of chylous ascites was 77%. Only 23% of patients required peritoneovenous shunt placement. However, shunt use was associated with an 80% surgical revision rate. Conservative treatment resolves most cases of postoperative chylous ascites. An abdominal catheter drain should be considered for significant or recurring chylous ascites. When a peritoneovenous shunt is required, it may be needed for an extensive period for resolution and there are significant complications associated with its use. Increasing amounts of preoperative chemotherapy and operative blood loss raise the likelihood of chylous ascites.",Journal Article,4860.0,71.0,determined clinical presentation risk factors optimal treatment chylous ascites develop retroperitoneal lymph node dissection patients testicular retrospectively reviewed records 329 patients underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection institution 23 7 chylous ascites postoperatively Clinical pathological parameters entered database Mean patient age chylous ascites presentation 32.1 years univariate multivariate logistic regression increasing amounts preoperative chemotherapy 1.24 intraoperative blood loss 1.33 predictive chylous ascites clinical presentation chylous ascites consisted abdominal fullness distention patients Initial treatment paracentesis combined total parenteral nutrition 77 patients abdominal drain persistent ascites 10 patients patients treated conservatively rate resolution chylous ascites 77 23 patients required peritoneovenous shunt placement shunt use associated 80 surgical revision rate Conservative treatment resolves cases postoperative chylous ascites abdominal catheter drain considered significant recurring chylous ascites peritoneovenous shunt required needed extensive period resolution significant complications associated use Increasing amounts preoperative chemotherapy operative blood loss raise likelihood chylous ascites,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 509, 3, 38, 1031, 43, 130, 2, 665, 24, 1, 17185, 3819, 17, 690, 50, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 4, 7, 5, 12, 21, 894, 446, 3, 1064, 1, 8766, 7, 54, 208, 539, 56, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 28, 114, 731, 1, 953, 382, 67, 42, 17185, 3819, 3541, 38, 2, 1301, 1038, 11, 2836, 237, 8, 609, 313, 69, 89, 28, 17185, 3819, 1031, 10, 531, 14, 60, 23, 880, 2, 331, 812, 320, 318, 602, 4939, 1, 498, 56, 15, 14, 259, 2, 1720, 315, 407, 15, 14, 466, 11, 464, 1, 17185, 3819, 3, 38, 1031, 1, 17185, 3819, 1695, 1, 1467, 30803, 2, 16635, 4, 62, 7, 388, 24, 10, 20287, 279, 15, 397, 5, 181, 8058, 5260, 4, 849, 1, 7, 35, 1467, 9203, 10, 95, 9, 1882, 3819, 4, 79, 7, 4, 7, 73, 10296, 3, 116, 1, 2125, 1, 17185, 3819, 10, 849, 158, 382, 1, 7, 616, 38243, 8637, 2613, 137, 8637, 119, 10, 41, 5, 35, 493, 221, 5646, 116, 4476, 24, 21321, 96, 140, 1, 573, 17185, 3819, 35, 1467, 3925, 9203, 257, 40, 515, 9, 93, 15, 6385, 17185, 3819, 198, 8, 38243, 8637, 16, 616, 192, 68, 40, 575, 9, 35, 1344, 727, 9, 2125, 2, 125, 32, 93, 521, 41, 5, 211, 119, 602, 4939, 1, 498, 56, 2, 1208, 315, 407, 5008, 3, 1420, 1, 17185, 3819]",1620.0,16952661,Chylous ascites post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection review M.

An unconventional antigen translated by a novel internal ribosome entry site elicits antitumor humoral immune reactions.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2006-10-01,"Self-tumor Ags that elicit antitumor immune responses in responses to IFN-alpha stimulation remain poorly defined. We screened a human testis cDNA library with sera from three polycythemia vera patients who responded to IFN-alpha and identified a novel Ag, MPD6. MPD6 belongs to the group of cryptic Ags without conventional genomic structure and is encoded by a cryptic open reading frame located in the 3'-untranslated region of myotrophin mRNA. MPD6 elicits IgG Ab responses in a subset of polycythemia vera patients, as well as patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and prostate cancer, suggesting that it is broadly immunogenic. The expression of myotrophin-MPD6 transcripts was up-regulated in some tumor cells, but only slightly increased in K562 cells in response to IFN-alpha treatment. By using bicistronic reporter constructs, we showed that the translation of MPD6 was mediated by a novel internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the MPD6 reading frame. Furthermore, the MPD6-IRES-mediated translation, but not myotrophin-MPD6 transcription, was significantly up-regulated in response to IFN-alpha stimulation. These findings demonstrate that a novel IRES-mediated mechanism may be responsible for the translation of unconventional self-Ag MPD6 in responsive to IFN-alpha stimulation. The eliciting antitumor immune response against unconventional Ag MPD6 in patients with myeloproliferative diseases suggests MPD6 as a potential target of novel immunotherapy.",Journal Article,4860.0,16.0,Self-tumor Ags elicit antitumor immune responses responses IFN-alpha stimulation remain poorly defined screened human testis cDNA library sera polycythemia vera patients responded IFN-alpha identified novel Ag MPD6 MPD6 belongs group cryptic Ags conventional genomic structure encoded cryptic open reading frame located 3'-untranslated region myotrophin mRNA MPD6 elicits IgG Ab responses subset polycythemia vera patients patients chronic myelogenous leukemia prostate suggesting broadly immunogenic expression myotrophin-MPD6 transcripts up-regulated slightly increased K562 response IFN-alpha treatment bicistronic reporter constructs showed translation MPD6 mediated novel internal ribosome entry site IRES upstream MPD6 reading frame Furthermore MPD6-IRES-mediated translation myotrophin-MPD6 transcription significantly up-regulated response IFN-alpha stimulation findings demonstrate novel IRES-mediated mechanism responsible translation unconventional self-Ag MPD6 responsive IFN-alpha stimulation eliciting antitumor immune response unconventional Ag MPD6 patients myeloproliferative diseases suggests MPD6 potential target novel immunotherapy,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1074, 30, 6596, 17, 5487, 579, 250, 253, 4, 253, 6, 1256, 950, 2503, 918, 1240, 395, 21, 2261, 8, 171, 4212, 4157, 5, 4210, 29, 169, 5755, 5756, 7, 54, 2211, 6, 1256, 950, 2, 108, 8, 229, 2741, 21406, 21406, 14815, 6, 3, 87, 1, 10294, 6596, 187, 809, 572, 2772, 2, 16, 4587, 20, 8, 10294, 1020, 7299, 5331, 2308, 4, 3, 5435, 7379, 1053, 1, 38251, 956, 21406, 8748, 3630, 5094, 253, 4, 8, 697, 1, 5755, 5756, 7, 22, 149, 22, 7, 5, 442, 2194, 2, 12, 802, 17, 192, 16, 5482, 4190, 3, 55, 1, 38251, 21406, 2680, 10, 126, 1065, 4, 476, 30, 37, 84, 158, 3223, 101, 4, 5208, 37, 4, 51, 6, 1256, 950, 24, 20, 75, 31006, 3674, 5500, 21, 224, 17, 3, 2691, 1, 21406, 10, 517, 20, 8, 229, 2329, 16346, 3001, 606, 22362, 3988, 1, 3, 21406, 7299, 5331, 798, 3, 21406, 22362, 517, 2691, 84, 44, 38251, 21406, 866, 10, 97, 126, 1065, 4, 51, 6, 1256, 950, 2503, 46, 272, 608, 17, 8, 229, 22362, 517, 670, 68, 40, 2327, 9, 3, 2691, 1, 18146, 1074, 2741, 21406, 4, 2443, 6, 1256, 950, 2503, 3, 10299, 579, 250, 51, 480, 18146, 2741, 21406, 4, 7, 5, 1342, 844, 21406, 22, 8, 174, 283, 1, 229, 726]",1421.0,16982933,unconventional antigen translated novel internal ribosome entry site elicits antitumor humoral immune reactions,0,0.0
Cancer-testis antigens: expression and correlation with survival in human urothelial carcinoma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-09-01,"Vaccination against human cancer is a promising therapeutic approach but the optimal antigen or antigens remain undefined. Cancer-testis antigens (CTA), a family of tumor-associated antigens, have both potent immunogenicity and restricted expression patterns in normal adult tissues, highly desirable characteristics for targets of anticancer vaccines. These antigens were evaluated for both the degree of expression and prognostic value in cancer of the urothelium. The expression patterns of nine CTAs (NY-ESO-1, LAGE-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A10, CT7, CT10, and GAGE) were examined by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR in a panel of high-grade urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Also assessed were correlations between the expression of CTAs by immunohistochemistry and both disease-free and overall survival. At least one CTA was expressed in 77% of samples and 61% of these tumors expressed more than one CTA. Additionally, patients with CT10-positive tumors had an improved disease-free survival (P=0.008) and overall survival (P=0.037) compared with patients with CT10-negative tumors.

Cancer-testis antigens are commonly expressed in multiple myeloma and induce systemic immunity following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2006-10-05,"Immunotherapies using cancer-testis (CT) antigens as targets represent a potentially useful treatment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who commonly show recurrent disease following chemotherapy. We analyzed the expression of 11 CT antigens in bone marrow samples from patients with MM (n=55) and healthy donors (n=32) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CT antigens were frequently expressed in MM with 56% (MAGEC2), 55% (MAGEA3), 35% (SSX1), 20% (SSX4, SSX5), 16% (SSX2), 15% (BAGE), 7% (NY-ESO-1), and 6% (ADAM2, LIPI) expressing the given antigen. Importantly, CT antigens were not expressed in healthy bone marrow. Analyzing patients with MM (n=66) for antibody responses against MAGEA3, SSX2, and NY-ESO-1, we found strong antibody responses against CT antigens preferentially in patients who had received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT).

Review of late complications of treatment and late relapse in testicular cancer.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2006-11-01,"With testicular cancer, a disease with a cure rate of 95%, the challenge is to restore quality of life to pretreatment levels and sustain it long-term. Although the implementation of guidelines and optimization of treatment modalities over the past years have served this purpose, some complications remain inevitable and experts are still challenged with late complications of outdated treatment standards. This article focuses on the late complications of cisplatin-based chemotherapy without disregarding those of currently applied infradiaphragmatic radiation. The most serious long-term complications of chemotherapy or radiotherapy are cardiovascular toxicity and second malignancies, as each has a 25-year risk of approximately 16%. Compared with the general population, risk for second malignancies remains significantly increased for at least 35 years after treatment. Chemotherapy-related cardiovascular toxicity is probably a result of both direct endothelial damage induced by cisplatin and indirect hormonal and metabolic changes. The increased incidence of the metabolic syndrome identified in long-term survivors is most likely associated with the lower testosterone levels reported. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy affects not only Leydig cells but also Sertoli and germ cells, resulting in infertility in 30% to 50% of testicular cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Chronic neurotoxicity occurs in half of men, whereas permanent ototoxicity and some degree of renal function impairment occur in up to 30%. Pulmonary fibrosis, occurring in 5% to 10% of patients treated with bleomycin, is fatal in 1%. Although current treatment of advanced disease has changed its natural course, we are challenged by an increasing incidence of late relapse, an entity with a distinct tumor biology characterized by latency and chemoresistance.",Journal Article,4829.0,37.0,testicular disease cure rate 95 challenge restore quality life pretreatment levels sustain long-term implementation guidelines optimization treatment modalities past years served purpose complications remain inevitable experts challenged late complications outdated treatment standards article focuses late complications cisplatin-based chemotherapy disregarding currently applied infradiaphragmatic radiation long-term complications chemotherapy radiotherapy cardiovascular toxicity second malignancies 25-year risk approximately 16 Compared general population risk second malignancies remains significantly increased 35 years treatment Chemotherapy-related cardiovascular toxicity probably direct endothelial damage induced cisplatin indirect hormonal metabolic changes increased incidence metabolic syndrome identified long-term survivors likely associated lower testosterone levels reported Cisplatin-based chemotherapy affects Leydig Sertoli germ resulting infertility 30 50 testicular patients treated chemotherapy Chronic neurotoxicity occurs half men permanent ototoxicity degree renal function impairment occur 30 Pulmonary fibrosis occurring 5 10 patients treated bleomycin fatal 1 current treatment advanced disease changed natural course challenged increasing incidence late relapse entity distinct characterized latency chemoresistance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5, 12, 8, 34, 5, 8, 1722, 116, 1, 48, 3, 1745, 16, 6, 6075, 372, 1, 358, 6, 1194, 148, 2, 8844, 192, 319, 337, 242, 3, 2393, 1, 677, 2, 3980, 1, 24, 1558, 252, 3, 1219, 60, 47, 5275, 26, 743, 476, 521, 918, 11077, 2, 3186, 32, 1234, 6389, 5, 807, 521, 1, 22393, 24, 3371, 26, 946, 3026, 23, 3, 807, 521, 1, 540, 90, 56, 187, 44538, 135, 1, 694, 1498, 30476, 121, 3, 96, 1762, 319, 337, 521, 1, 56, 15, 310, 32, 2179, 155, 2, 419, 441, 22, 296, 71, 8, 243, 111, 43, 1, 705, 245, 72, 5, 3, 1083, 266, 43, 9, 419, 441, 469, 97, 101, 9, 28, 506, 465, 60, 50, 24, 56, 139, 2179, 155, 16, 4061, 8, 757, 1, 110, 1196, 845, 1350, 277, 20, 540, 2, 6110, 1761, 2, 1436, 400, 3, 101, 287, 1, 3, 1436, 681, 108, 4, 319, 337, 332, 16, 96, 322, 41, 5, 3, 280, 2660, 148, 210, 540, 90, 56, 2561, 44, 158, 23505, 37, 84, 120, 31032, 2, 2280, 37, 1113, 4, 5901, 4, 201, 6, 212, 1, 12, 7, 73, 5, 56, 442, 3561, 1780, 4, 1303, 1, 325, 547, 4377, 8760, 2, 476, 1444, 1, 343, 2315, 1271, 4, 126, 6, 201, 1087, 3000, 1821, 4, 33, 6, 79, 1, 7, 73, 5, 5213, 16, 3034, 4, 14, 242, 291, 24, 1, 131, 34, 71, 2368, 211, 1504, 906, 21, 32, 6389, 20, 35, 602, 287, 1, 807, 429, 35, 2983, 5, 8, 834, 30, 891, 765, 20, 5301, 2, 3782]",1790.0,17112453,Review late complications treatment late relapse testicular,3,0.010169491525423728
Novel tumor antigens elicit anti-tumor humoral immune reactions in a subset of patients with polycythemia vera.,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",Clin. Immunol.,2006-11-17,"We attempted to determine whether the immune reactions elicited by aberrantly expressed testis antigens contribute to the beneficial responses to interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy and other therapies in patients with polycythemia vera (PV). We screened a human testis cDNA library using SEREX (serological analysis of tumor antigens by screening an expression cDNA library with sera from three patients with PV who had undergone IFN-alpha-induced or other therapeutics-induced remission). We identified two novel PV associated tumor antigens, PV65 (eIF-2alpha) and PV13 (protamine 2). These 2 antigens elicited IgG antibody reactions in a subset of PV patients but not in healthy donors, suggesting that they are authentic tumor antigens. Increased phosphorylation of PV65 in response to stimulation of IFN-alpha, and upregulation of PV13 in tumor cells might enhance their abilities in elicitation of immune reactions in patients. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the regulation of the self-antigen repertoire in eliciting anti-tumor immune reactions in patients with polycythemia vera, and suggest their potential as the targets of novel immunotherapy.",Journal Article,4813.0,19.0,attempted determine immune reactions elicited aberrantly expressed testis antigens contribute beneficial responses interferon IFN -alpha therapy therapies patients polycythemia vera PV screened human testis cDNA library SEREX serological antigens screening expression cDNA library sera patients PV undergone IFN-alpha-induced therapeutics-induced remission identified novel PV associated antigens PV65 eIF-2alpha PV13 protamine 2 2 antigens elicited IgG antibody reactions subset PV patients healthy donors suggesting authentic antigens Increased phosphorylation PV65 response stimulation IFN-alpha upregulation PV13 enhance abilities elicitation immune reactions patients findings provide new insights mechanism underlying regulation self-antigen repertoire eliciting anti-tumor immune reactions patients polycythemia vera suggest potential targets novel immunotherapy,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 4098, 6, 223, 317, 3, 250, 2428, 5179, 20, 5619, 570, 1575, 1248, 6, 3, 2524, 253, 6, 1688, 1256, 950, 36, 2, 127, 235, 4, 7, 5, 5755, 5756, 3328, 21, 2261, 8, 171, 4212, 4157, 75, 30303, 14132, 65, 1, 30, 1575, 20, 453, 35, 55, 4212, 4157, 5, 4210, 29, 169, 7, 5, 3328, 54, 42, 1989, 1256, 950, 277, 15, 127, 1943, 277, 734, 21, 108, 100, 229, 3328, 41, 30, 1575, 44539, 18767, 10040, 2, 44540, 33223, 18, 46, 18, 1575, 5179, 3630, 548, 2428, 4, 8, 697, 1, 3328, 7, 84, 44, 4, 1331, 2344, 802, 17, 491, 32, 19590, 30, 1575, 101, 982, 1, 44539, 4, 51, 6, 2503, 1, 1256, 950, 2, 2218, 1, 44540, 4, 30, 37, 822, 1304, 136, 7965, 4, 31033, 1, 250, 2428, 4, 7, 46, 272, 377, 217, 1957, 237, 3, 670, 1181, 3, 863, 1, 3, 1074, 448, 5306, 4, 10299, 312, 30, 250, 2428, 4, 7, 5, 5755, 5756, 2, 309, 136, 174, 22, 3, 637, 1, 229, 726]",1151.0,17113348,Novel antigens elicit anti-tumor humoral immune reactions subset patients polycythemia vera,1,0.003389830508474576

Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2006-01-01,"Improved treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has virtually eliminated testicular relapse. However, the control of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia remains a therapeutic challenge in childhood ALL, partly because of the late complications arising from cranial irradiation. In most current pediatric protocols, cranial irradiation (12 to 18 Gy) is given to 5% to 25% of patients--those with T-cell ALL, overt CNS disease (CNS3 status) or high-risk cytogenetics. CNS control is a less urgent concern in adults with ALL, in whom systemic relapse remains the major problem. With current approaches, approximately 2% to 10% of patients can be expected to develop CNS relapse. Children with B-cell precursor ALL who have a late CNS relapse (after an initial remission of 18 months or more) and did not receive cranial irradiation have an excellent outcome after retrieval therapy, with a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate approaching that in newly diagnosed patients.

Recurrence pattern and proposed surveillance protocol following post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2007-01-01,"We evaluated the recurrence pattern in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors treated with post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and determined the optimal surveillance strategy in these patients. Between 1980 and 2003, 236 patients with clinical stage IIA-III nonseminomatous germ cell tumors underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Patients with increased preoperative tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein greater than 15 ng/ml and/or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin greater than 2.2 U/ml) were excluded from study resulting in 198 patients for analysis. We retrospectively reviewed medical records for pertinent clinical and treatment related outcomes. In our patient population recurrence developed in 45 (23%) patients and 22 (11%) died of disease at a median followup of 41 months (range 6 to 250) after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The clinical stage of testis cancer was IIA in 17, IIB in 49, IIC in 83 and III in 49 patients. Of the 45 patients with postoperative recurrence, 16 had concomitant multiple sites of recurrence with a total of 64 sites reported. Of the cases of recurrence 21 (46.7%) were in those of clinical stage III, 18 (40%) stage IIC and 6 (11.8%) stage IIB disease.

Incidence of disease outside modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection templates in clinical stage I or IIA nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2007-03-01,"We evaluated the incidence, sites and histology of disease outside 5 modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection templates for patients with low stage nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. Our cohort consisted of 500 consecutive patients with clinical stage I to IIA nonseminomatous germ cell tumors who underwent primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection from 1989 to 2004. We analyzed 191 patients with pathological stage II disease and defined the incidence of disease outside 5 modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection templates, 3 described for open surgery (Testicular Tumor Study Group, Indiana University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and 2 for laparoscopic surgery (University of Innsbruck and The Johns Hopkins University). Of 191 patients with pathological stage II disease, 111 (58%) had clinical stage I disease and 80 (42%) had clinical stage IIA disease. Depending on the template applied, extra-template disease ranged from 3% to 23% of all patients and was 1% to 11% of patients with pN1 disease. Regardless of template, histological distribution of extra-template disease was not significantly different from in-template disease with approximately 90% viable germ cell tumor, 10% teratoma only and 20% with any teratoma. For right side templates inclusion of para-aortic, preaortic and right common iliac regions decreased the incidence of extra-template disease to 2%. For left side templates inclusion of interaortocaval, precaval, paracaval and left common iliac regions decreased the incidence of extra-template disease to 3%. A significant number of men with clinical stage I to IIA nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and retroperitoneal metastases have disease present outside the limits of modified templates, including 20% to 30% with chemoresistant teratomatous elements.

Molecular dissection of hyperdiploid multiple myeloma by gene expression profiling.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-04-01,"Hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (H-MM) is the most common form of myeloma. In this gene expression profiling study, we show that H-MM is defined by a protein biosynthesis signature that is primarily driven by a gene dosage mechanism as a result of trisomic chromosomes. Within H-MM, four independently validated patient clusters overexpressing nonoverlapping sets of genes that form cognate pathways/networks that have potential biological importance in multiple myeloma were identified. One prominent cluster, cluster 1, is characterized by high expression of cancer testis antigen and proliferation-associated genes. Tumors from these patients were more proliferative than tumors in other clusters (median plasma cell labeling index, 3.8; P < 0.05). Another cluster, cluster 3, is characterized by genes involved in tumor necrosis factor/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling and antiapoptosis. These patients have better response to bortezomib as compared with patients within other clusters (70% versus 29%; P = 0.02). Furthermore, for a group of patients generally thought to have better prognosis, a cluster of patients with short survival (cluster 1; median survival, 27 months) could be identified. This analysis illustrates the heterogeneity within H-MM and the importance of defining specific cytogenetic prognostic factors. Furthermore, the signatures that defined these clusters may provide a basis for tailoring treatment to individual patients.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",4678.0,171.0,Hyperdiploid multiple myeloma H-MM common form myeloma expression profiling H-MM defined biosynthesis signature primarily driven dosage mechanism trisomic chromosomes H-MM independently validated patient clusters overexpressing nonoverlapping sets form cognate pathways/networks potential importance multiple myeloma identified prominent cluster cluster 1 characterized high expression testis antigen proliferation-associated patients proliferative clusters median plasma labeling index 3.8 P 0.05 cluster cluster 3 characterized involved necrosis factor/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling antiapoptosis patients better response bortezomib compared patients clusters 70 versus 29 P 0.02 Furthermore group patients generally thought better prognosis cluster patients short survival cluster 1 median survival 27 months identified illustrates heterogeneity H-MM importance defining specific cytogenetic prognostic factors Furthermore signatures defined clusters provide basis tailoring treatment individual patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8847, 232, 555, 321, 16, 3, 96, 186, 1297, 1, 4, 26, 145, 55, 1080, 45, 21, 514, 17, 555, 321, 16, 395, 20, 8, 178, 6225, 1651, 17, 16, 1561, 1621, 20, 8, 145, 3323, 670, 22, 8, 757, 1, 56171, 3560, 262, 555, 321, 294, 1042, 938, 69, 3780, 2810, 10142, 2270, 1, 214, 17, 1297, 8903, 460, 3991, 17, 47, 174, 1037, 1187, 4, 232, 11, 108, 104, 3689, 3132, 3132, 14, 16, 765, 20, 64, 55, 1, 12, 448, 2, 457, 41, 214, 57, 29, 46, 7, 11, 80, 2441, 76, 57, 4, 127, 3780, 52, 554, 31, 3383, 558, 27, 66, 19, 13, 474, 1809, 3132, 3132, 27, 16, 765, 20, 214, 646, 4, 30, 1523, 161, 928, 161, 2119, 314, 2, 24910, 46, 7, 47, 380, 51, 6, 819, 22, 72, 5, 7, 262, 127, 3780, 431, 185, 462, 19, 13, 588, 798, 9, 8, 87, 1, 7, 1228, 2739, 6, 47, 380, 356, 8, 3132, 1, 7, 5, 978, 25, 3132, 14, 52, 25, 428, 53, 359, 40, 108, 26, 65, 6342, 3, 1144, 262, 555, 321, 2, 3, 1187, 1, 2847, 112, 1266, 177, 130, 798, 3, 2210, 17, 395, 46, 3780, 68, 377, 8, 877, 9, 7101, 24, 6, 797, 7]",1381.0,17409404,Molecular dissection hyperdiploid multiple myeloma expression profiling,0,0.0

Clinical outcome following post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in men with intermediate- and poor-risk nonseminomatous germ cell tumour.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2007-05-01,"To evaluate the outcome in patients treated with chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) after an initial diagnosis of International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumour (NSGCT), as the integration of chemotherapy and surgery in managing advanced NSGCT continues to develop. Between 1989 and 2003, 157 patients initially diagnosed with IGCCCG intermediate- and poor-risk NSGCT had RPLND after chemotherapy at the authors' institution, with a median follow-up of 36 months. Progression-free probability (PFP) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the prognostic significance of risk factors for disease progression after RPLND. In all, 68 (43%) and 89 (57%) patients were assigned as intermediate- and poor-risk, respectively. At the time of RPLND the median residual retroperitoneal mass was 3.0 cm and 29 (19%) men had elevated serum tumour markers (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin, or both). Retroperitoneal residual masses were completely resected in 147 (94%) patients; retroperitoneal histology revealed fibrosis in 73 (47%), teratoma in 63 (40%) and viable GCT in 21 (13%). The 5-year overall DSS and PFP were 81% and 70%, respectively. Patients with poor-risk NSGCT were at no greater risk of disease progression than those with intermediate-risk NSGCT.

Embryonic stem cell transcription factor signatures in the diagnosis of primary and metastatic germ cell tumors.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2007-06-01,"The core embryonic stem cell transcription factors (TFs) OCT3/4 (OCT4), NANOG, and SOX2 have shared as well as nonoverlapping roles in stem cell growth and differentiation. These same TFs are also expressed in various types of human germ cell tumors (GCTs), implicating them in regulation of tumor growth and differentiation. Although NANOG and OCT3/4 are sensitive and specific markers for seminoma and embryonal carcinoma, neither factor aids in the clinically important distinction of seminomatous from nonseminomatous tumors. In contrast, expression profiling data suggest that SOX2 may help with this distinction. To determine if a panel of embryonic stem cell TFs (NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2) can facilitate the identification and distinction of seminomatous from nonseminomatous GCTs, we evaluated their expression by immunohistochemistry in primary testicular (n=41) and metastatic retroperitoneal (n=43) GCTs. Our results confirm NANOG and OCT3/4 as sensitive and specific markers for primary seminoma and embryonal carcinoma and demonstrate the novel finding that NANOG is a marker for metastatic GCTs. In addition, SOX2 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma but not pure seminoma and is therefore a useful diagnostic marker for distinguishing seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs. In summary, we find that the embryonic stem cell TF signature of seminoma is NANOG+, OCT3/4+, and SOX2-, whereas embryonal carcinoma is NANOG+, OCT3/4+, and SOX2+, and expect these immunohistochemical profiles will facilitate the diagnosis of both primary and metastatic GCTs.",Journal Article,4617.0,128.0,core embryonic stem transcription factors TFs OCT3/4 OCT4 NANOG SOX2 shared nonoverlapping roles stem growth differentiation TFs expressed types human germ GCTs implicating regulation growth differentiation NANOG OCT3/4 sensitive specific markers seminoma embryonal carcinoma factor aids clinically important distinction seminomatous nonseminomatous contrast expression profiling suggest SOX2 help distinction determine panel embryonic stem TFs NANOG OCT3/4 SOX2 facilitate identification distinction seminomatous nonseminomatous GCTs evaluated expression immunohistochemistry primary testicular n=41 metastatic retroperitoneal n=43 GCTs confirm NANOG OCT3/4 sensitive specific markers primary seminoma embryonal carcinoma demonstrate novel finding NANOG marker metastatic GCTs addition SOX2 expressed embryonal carcinoma pure seminoma useful diagnostic marker distinguishing seminomatous nonseminomatous GCTs summary embryonic stem TF signature seminoma NANOG+ OCT3/4+ SOX2- embryonal carcinoma NANOG+ OCT3/4+ SOX2+ expect immunohistochemical profiles facilitate diagnosis primary metastatic GCTs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1793, 5390, 452, 31, 866, 130, 7335, 14184, 39, 11511, 11851, 2, 4664, 47, 2664, 22, 149, 22, 10142, 1790, 4, 452, 31, 129, 2, 910, 46, 827, 7335, 32, 120, 570, 4, 747, 630, 1, 171, 2280, 31, 57, 5553, 7912, 1370, 4, 863, 1, 30, 129, 2, 910, 242, 11851, 2, 14184, 39, 32, 745, 2, 112, 525, 9, 6930, 2, 5239, 134, 2174, 161, 4174, 4, 3, 505, 305, 6628, 1, 17816, 29, 8052, 57, 4, 748, 55, 1080, 74, 309, 17, 4664, 68, 987, 5, 26, 6628, 6, 223, 492, 8, 993, 1, 5390, 452, 31, 7335, 11851, 14184, 39, 2, 4664, 122, 1876, 3, 911, 2, 6628, 1, 17816, 29, 8052, 5553, 21, 194, 136, 55, 20, 888, 4, 86, 78, 605, 2, 113, 2591, 78, 601, 5553, 114, 99, 1843, 11851, 2, 14184, 39, 22, 745, 2, 112, 525, 9, 86, 6930, 2, 5239, 134, 2, 608, 3, 229, 1567, 17, 11851, 16, 8, 952, 9, 113, 5553, 4, 352, 4664, 16, 570, 4, 5239, 134, 84, 44, 3092, 6930, 2, 16, 673, 8, 999, 752, 952, 9, 4508, 17816, 2, 8052, 5553, 4, 1962, 21, 2469, 17, 3, 5390, 452, 31, 4641, 1651, 1, 6930, 16, 11851, 14184, 39, 2, 4664, 547, 5239, 134, 16, 11851, 14184, 39, 2, 4664, 2, 8439, 46, 1382, 1241, 303, 1876, 3, 147, 1, 110, 86, 2, 113, 5553]",1517.0,17527070,Embryonic stem transcription factor signatures diagnosis primary metastatic germ,0,0.0

We evaluated our experience with PC-RPLND to determine the incidence of disease extending outside the boundaries of a modified PC-RPLND. From 1989 through 2003, a total of 532 men underwent PC-RPLND for metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). Of these, 269 (51%) had either viable germ cell tumor (GCT) or teratoma present in the RPLND specimen. After Institutional Review Board approval, clinical and pathologic data were obtained from our prospective surgical database. The incidence of retroperitoneal disease outside the boundaries of five modified templates was reported for the presence of viable GCT or teratoma. Of the 269 patients with viable GCT or teratoma, 20 to 86 (7% to 32%) patients had evidence of extratemplate retroperitoneal disease, depending on the boundaries of the modified template. There was no difference in the histologic distribution for patients with disease confined to or outside of the modified templates. Despite the absence of preoperative radiographic evidence of disease outside the boundaries of the Testicular Tumor Study Group template, the incidence of extratemplate metastasis for men with residual retroperitoneal masses less than 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 5, and more than 5 cm was two of 24 (8%), seven of 38 (18%), 27 of 92 (29%), and 14 of 55 (25%), respectively.

Altered adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in human cancer.,Genome research,Genome Res.,2007-10-01,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing was recently shown to be abundant in the human transcriptome, affecting thousands of genes. Employing a bioinformatic approach, we identified significant global hypoediting of Alu repetitive elements in brain, prostate, lung, kidney, and testis tumors. Experimental validation confirmed this finding, showing significantly reduced editing in Alu sequences within MED13 transcripts in brain tissues. Looking at editing of specific recoding and noncoding sites, including in cancer-related genes, a more complex picture emerged, with a gene-specific editing pattern in tumors vs. normal tissues. Additionally, we found reduced RNA levels of all three editing mediating enzymes, ADAR, ADARB1, and ADARB2, in brain tumors. The reduction of ADARB2 correlated with the grade of malignancy of glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive of brain tumors, displaying a 99% decrease in ADARB2 RNA levels. Consistently, overexpression of ADAR and ADARB1 in the U87 glioblastoma multiforme cell line resulted in decreased proliferation rate, suggesting that reduced A-to-I editing in brain tumors is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. Altered epigenetic control was recently shown to play a central role in oncogenesis.

Viable germ cell tumor at postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: can we predict patients at risk of disease progression?,Cancer,Cancer,2007-12-01,"Patients with viable tumor at time of postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) are at an increased risk of disease progression. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical variables that predict this adverse outcome. Between 1980 and 2003, 236 patients with testicular cancer underwent PC-RPLND, 41 of whom (17%) were found to have viable tumor. The authors retrospectively reviewed the patients' medical records for pertinent clinical and treatment-related outcomes. At a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 18 patients (44%) had developed disease recurrence and 12 patients (29%) had died of disease. The group of patients who developed postoperative disease recurrence had a larger median dimension of the retroperitoneal mass (7.0 cm and 3.5 cm, respectively; P = .03). The use of adjuvant chemotherapy after PC-RPLND was less common in those patients developing postoperative disease recurrence (P = .06). On multivariate analysis, patients classified as being at intermediate or poor risk according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) had a poorer recurrence-free survival (P = .006 and P = .07, respectively). On multivariate analysis, predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) included an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level before PC-RPLND (P = .003) and postoperative disease recurrence (P = .02).

Immunologic and clinical outcomes of a randomized phase II trial of two multipeptide vaccines for melanoma in the adjuvant setting.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2007-11-01,"Human melanoma cells express shared antigens recognized by CD8(+) T lymphocytes, the most common of which are melanocytic differentiation proteins and cancer-testis antigens. However, peptide vaccines for melanoma usually target only one or two MHC class I-associated peptide antigens. Because melanomas commonly evade immune recognition by selective antigen loss, optimization of melanoma vaccines may require development of more complex multipeptide vaccines. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, we have evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine containing a mixture of 12 peptides from melanocytic differentiation proteins and cancer-testis antigens, designed for human leukocyte antigen types that represent 80% of the melanoma patient population. This was compared with a four-peptide vaccine with only melanocytic differentiation peptides. Immune responses were assessed in peripheral blood and in vaccine-draining lymph nodes. These data show that (a) the 12-peptide mixture is immunogenic in all treated patients; (b) immunogenicity of individual peptides is maintained despite competition with additional peptides for binding to MHC molecules; (c) a broader and more robust immune response is induced by vaccination with the more complex 12-peptide mixture; and (d) clinical outcome in this peptide vaccine trial correlates with immune responses measured in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. These data support continued investigation of complex multipeptide vaccines for melanoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4464.0,118.0,Human melanoma express shared antigens recognized CD8 lymphocytes common melanocytic differentiation cancer-testis antigens peptide vaccines melanoma usually target MHC class I-associated peptide antigens melanomas commonly evade immune recognition selective antigen loss optimization melanoma vaccines require development complex multipeptide vaccines prospective randomized clinical trial evaluated safety immunogenicity vaccine containing mixture 12 peptides melanocytic differentiation cancer-testis antigens designed human leukocyte antigen types represent 80 melanoma patient population compared four-peptide vaccine melanocytic differentiation peptides Immune responses assessed peripheral blood vaccine-draining lymph nodes 12-peptide mixture immunogenic treated patients b immunogenicity individual peptides maintained despite competition additional peptides binding MHC molecules c broader robust immune response induced vaccination complex 12-peptide mixture clinical outcome peptide vaccine trial correlates immune responses measured peripheral blood lymphocytes support continued investigation complex multipeptide vaccines melanoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[171, 37, 1669, 2664, 1575, 1904, 20, 968, 102, 1594, 3, 96, 186, 1, 92, 32, 6123, 910, 652, 2, 12, 7697, 1575, 137, 1389, 1842, 9, 2082, 283, 158, 104, 15, 100, 3658, 1040, 70, 41, 1389, 1575, 408, 1965, 841, 6636, 250, 2335, 20, 1094, 448, 407, 3980, 1, 1842, 68, 1353, 193, 1, 80, 840, 14516, 1842, 4, 8, 482, 384, 38, 160, 21, 47, 194, 3, 367, 2, 4050, 1, 8, 1274, 1101, 8, 6972, 1, 133, 2491, 29, 6123, 910, 652, 2, 12, 7697, 1575, 1114, 9, 171, 3627, 448, 630, 17, 1231, 493, 1, 3, 69, 266, 26, 10, 72, 5, 8, 294, 1389, 1274, 5, 158, 6123, 910, 2491, 250, 253, 11, 275, 4, 672, 315, 2, 4, 1274, 7535, 263, 502, 46, 74, 514, 17, 8, 3, 133, 1389, 6972, 16, 4190, 4, 62, 73, 7, 132, 4050, 1, 797, 2491, 16, 1955, 550, 12809, 5, 402, 2491, 9, 791, 6, 3658, 1598, 256, 8, 5410, 2, 80, 1922, 250, 51, 16, 277, 20, 1915, 5, 3, 80, 840, 133, 1389, 6972, 2, 427, 38, 228, 4, 26, 1389, 1274, 160, 1871, 5, 250, 253, 644, 4, 3, 672, 315, 1594, 46, 74, 538, 1351, 940, 1, 840, 14516, 1842, 9]",1436.0,17975151,Immunologic clinical outcomes randomized phase II trial multipeptide vaccines melanoma adjuvant setting,5,0.01694915254237288

Immunother.,2008-01-01,"The TAG-1, TAG-2a, TAG-2b, and TAG-2c cancer/testis genes, known to be expressed in an unusually high percentage of melanoma cell lines, are shown here to be expressed in a variety of tumor lines of diverse histologic type, including cancers of the brain, breast, colon, lung, ovary, pharynx, and tongue. The genes are also expressed in fresh, uncultured melanoma, and ovarian cancer cells. Epitope prediction algorithms were used to identify potential HLA-A1, HLA-A2, HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA-B8 epitopes, and these potential epitopes were tested for their ability to stimulate a peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response using lymphocytes from healthy donors. Two HLA-A2-restricted epitopes (SLGWLFLLL and LLLRLECNV) were identified using this approach. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for each of these peptides were capable of recognizing tumor cells expressing both the corresponding class I major histocompatibility complex encoded molecule and the TAG genes.

Recurrence in nonseminomatous germ cell testis tumor patients with no viable tumor at postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.,Urology,Urology,2007-12-01,"To determine disease-related outcomes in metastatic testis cancer patients with absence of viable cancer in the postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) specimen and determine whether clinical variables can help predict disease progression. Between 1980 and 2003, 195 patients had no viable tumor at the time of PC-RPLND. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records for pertinent clinical and treatment-related outcomes. At a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 6 to 236 months), 35 patients (18%) developed recurrences, and 18 (9%) died of disease. On multivariate analysis, predictors of recurrence-free survival in patients with no viable tumor were advanced clinical stage (P = 0.01) and poor-risk International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) group (P = 0.01), whereas predictors of disease-specific survival included an elevated serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level before PC-RPLND (P = 0.002), pathologic diameter of the retroperitoneal mass (P = 0.05), and postoperative recurrence (P <0.0001). An hCG level greater than 1.2 mIU/mL before PC-RPLND trended toward statistical significance (P = 0.07), and pathologic diameter of the retroperitoneal mass greater than 2.5 cm was statistically significant (P = 0.05) in predicting a poorer disease-specific survival.

Male survivors were significantly more likely than siblings to perform monthly self-testicular examinations (19% vs. 9%, p = 0.02).

Medical treatment of advanced testicular cancer.,JAMA,JAMA,2008-02-01,"The medical treatment of advanced testicular germ cell tumors has changed over the past 30 years, with long-term survival now achieved in the majority of patients. Clinicians need to be familiar with the available treatment regimens for testicular cancer and their associated toxic effects. To review the treatments used for advanced testicular germ cell tumors and their associated short-term and long-term complications. A search was performed of all English-language literature (1966 to October 2007) within the MEDLINE database using the terms neoplasms, germ cell, or embryonal or testicular neoplasms restricted to humans, drug therapy, complications, and mortality. The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials Databases (through October 2007) was also searched using the terms testicular cancer or germ cell tumors. Bibliographies were reviewed to extract other relevant articles. One hundred eighty-six articles were selected based on pertinence to advanced testicular cancer treatment, associated complications, and late relapses with an emphasis on randomized controlled trials. The treatment of advanced testicular germ cell tumors with cisplatin combination chemotherapy is based on risk stratification (good, intermediate, or poor prognosis) according to pretreatment clinical features of prognostic value. Clinical trials have demonstrated that approximately 90% of patients classified as having a good prognosis achieve a durable complete remission to either 4 cycles of etoposide and cisplatin or 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Complete responses are achieved less frequently for patients with intermediate- and poor-risk germ cell tumors, in whom 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin remains the standard of care. Second- and third-line programs, including high-dose chemotherapy, also have curative potential. Chronic toxicities associated with therapy include cardiovascular disease, infertility, and secondary malignancies. Late relapses may also occur.

These patients underwent a primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). No viable tumor was identified in the specimen, and both patients were alive without disease at 16 months follow-up. Of the remaining 7 patients, the clinical stages were IIA (N = 1), IIB (N = 3), and III (N = 3), and all were treated with chemotherapy followed by RPLND. The MTT histology of these RPLND specimens consisted of adenocarcinoma (N = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (N = 2), angiosarcoma (N = 1), and astrocytoma (N = 1). Following preoperative chemotherapy, a significant radiologic response (defined as more than a 25% reduction in maximum tumor circumferential diameter) was demonstrated in 1 patient, and normalization of serum tumor markers was demonstrated in 6. At a mean follow-up of 5 years, 3 of these 7 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 had persistent disease, and 3 had died of disease, and their median disease-specific survival duration was 4.6 years.

Recent developments in germ cell tumors of the testes.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2008-05-01,"An overview on several important developments in testicular germ cell tumors in the past year is provided. Despite being highly treatable even in advanced stages, recent studies demonstrate that testicular germ cell tumor mortalities can vary significantly in different regions of the world, suggesting limited access to appropriate treatments in certain geographic regions. Several clinically relevant studies on the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in early and advanced stages of disease, and chemotherapy, particularly high-dose chemotherapy in the first-line and salvage settings, were reported.

Safety and immunogenicity study of NY-ESO-1b peptide and montanide ISA-51 vaccination of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer in high-risk first remission.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-05-01,"The cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 is expressed by >40% of advanced epithelial ovarian cancers and is a promising immunotherapeutic target. In this study, we describe the effects of vaccination with the HLA-A*0201-restricted NY-ESO-1b peptide on patients with epithelial ovarian cancer in high-risk first remission. After primary surgery and chemotherapy, high-risk epithelial ovarian cancer patients in first clinical remission received NY-ESO-1b peptide and Montanide every 3 weeks for five vaccinations. Tumor expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Toxicity was monitored using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Scale Version 2. NY-ESO-1 specific humoral immunity (ELISA), T-cell immunity (tetramer and ELISPOT), and delayed-type hypersensitivity were assessed on weeks 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 1 fatigue, anemia, pruritus, myalgias, and hyperthyroidism and grade 2 hypothyroidism. There were no grade 3/grade 4 adverse events. Three of four patients (75%) with NY-ESO-1-positive tumor showed T-cell immunity by tetramer (0.6-9.5%) and ELISPOT (range, 35-260 spots). Four of five patients (80%) with NY-ESO-1-negative tumor showed T-cell immunity by tetramer (1.0-12.1%) and/or ELISPOT (range, 35-400 spots). With a median follow-up of 11.3 months, six of nine patients (67%) have recurred, with a median progression-free survival of 13 months (95% confidence interval, 11.2 months-not reached). Three of nine patients remain in complete clinical remission at 25, 38, and 52 months. Vaccination of high-risk HLA-A*0201-positive epithelial ovarian cancer patients with NY-ESO-1b and Montanide has minimal toxicity and induces specific T-cell immunity in patients with both NY-ESO-1-positive and NY-ESO-1-negative tumors.

"OSU-HDAC42, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, blocks prostate tumor progression in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.",Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2008-05-01,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suppress tumor cell growth via a broad spectrum of mechanisms, which should prove advantageous in the context of cancer prevention. Here, we examined the effect of dietary administration of OSU-HDAC42, a novel HDAC inhibitor, on prostate tumor progression in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Based on a series of pilot studies, an AIN-76A diet was formulated containing 208 ppm OSU-HDAC42, which was estimated to deliver approximately 25 mg/kg of drug per day to each mouse and found to cause a suppression of PC-3 xenograft tumor growth equivalent to that achieved by gavage administration of a similar dose. At 6 weeks of age, TRAMP mice received this drug-containing or control diet for 4 or 18 weeks and were evaluated for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and carcinoma development, respectively. OSU-HDAC42 not only decreased the severity of PIN and completely prevented its progression to poorly differentiated carcinoma (74% incidence in controls versus none in drug-treated mice), but also shifted tumorigenesis to a more differentiated phenotype, suppressing absolute and relative urogenital tract weights by 86% and 85%, respectively, at 24 weeks of age. This tumor suppression was associated with the modulation of intraprostatic biomarkers, including those indicative of HDAC inhibition, increased apoptosis and differentiation, and decreased proliferation. With the exception of completely reversible hematologic alterations and testicular degeneration, no significant changes in body weight or other indicators of general health were observed in drug-treated mice. These results suggest that OSU-HDAC42 has value in prostate cancer prevention.

Treatment of stage I seminoma: is it time to change your practice?,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2008-11-07,"At the plenary session of the 2008 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, updated results were presented from a large randomized phase III trial comparing adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and one cycle of Carboplatin for the adjuvant treatment of Stage I seminoma. Results of this Medical Research Council (MRC) trial led its investigators to conclude that one cycle of carboplatin was equivalent in safety and efficacy and less toxic than RT. In this editorial, the trial's design, statistics, toxicity, and length of follow-up are discussed within the context of historical treatments of this disease. With a 1.3% increase in relapse rate (5.3% with carboplatin vs. 4.0% with radiation), a 3% or greater increase in relapse rate could not be excluded, the primary endpoint of the study. A decrease in second testicular germ cell tumors was observed, but was equivalent to the increase in relapse rate. Acute toxicity was generally less with carboplatin.

"National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry laboratory medicine practice guidelines for use of tumor markers in testicular, prostate, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancers.",Clinical chemistry,Clin. Chem.,2008-12-01,"Updated National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines for the use of tumor markers in the clinic have been developed. Published reports relevant to use of tumor markers for 5 cancer sites--testicular, prostate, colorectal, breast, and ovarian--were critically reviewed. For testicular cancer, alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase are recommended for diagnosis/case finding, staging, prognosis determination, recurrence detection, and therapy monitoring. alpha-Fetoprotein is also recommended for differential diagnosis of nonseminomatous and seminomatous germ cell tumors. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not recommended for prostate cancer screening, but may be used for detecting disease recurrence and monitoring therapy. Free PSA measurement data are useful for distinguishing malignant from benign prostatic disease when total PSA is <10 microg/L. In colorectal cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen is recommended (with some caveats) for prognosis determination, postoperative surveillance, and therapy monitoring in advanced disease. Fecal occult blood testing may be used for screening asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. For breast cancer, estrogen and progesterone receptors are mandatory for predicting response to hormone therapy, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 measurement is mandatory for predicting response to trastuzumab, and urokinase plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 may be used for determining prognosis in lymph node-negative patients. CA15-3/BR27-29 or carcinoembryonic antigen may be used for therapy monitoring in advanced disease. CA125 is recommended (with transvaginal ultrasound) for early detection of ovarian cancer in women at high risk for this disease. CA125 is also recommended for differential diagnosis of suspicious pelvic masses in postmenopausal women, as well as for detection of recurrence, monitoring of therapy, and determination of prognosis in women with ovarian cancer.

Long-term outcome for men with teratoma found at postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-03-01,"Patients with pure teratoma within the postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) specimen traditionally have been considered at low risk for disease progression. The objectives of this study were to determine the disease-related outcomes of patients who had pure teratoma identified at the time of PC-RPLND and to examine the prognostic value of clinical variables that were identified previously as important predictors of disease recurrence in these patients. Between 1980 and 2003, 97 patients with metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor and pure teratoma histology at the time of PC-RPLND were identified. The medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively for pertinent clinical and treatment-related outcomes. At a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 21 patients (22%) developed recurrent disease after PC-RPLND. The 5-year and 10-year probabilities (+/-standard error) of freedom from disease recurrence were 81%+/-4% and 76%+/-5%, respectively. The postchemotherapy alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and mediastinal involvement at presentation were statistically significant predictors of disease recurrence on multivariate analysis. Nine of 97 patients (9.3%) died from testis cancer, and 4 patients died from other causes. In patients with pure teratoma histology at PC-RPLND, mediastinal involvement at presentation and the presence of an elevated AFP level before PC-RPLND predicted an unfavorable outcome. The absence of mediastinal involvement and normal AFP level, however, did not confirm freedom from disease recurrence. Patients who had teratoma at the time of PC-RPLND remained at considerable risk for disease progression because of the unpredictable nature of teratoma and the presence of unrecognized, active germ cell disease outside the retroperitoneum.",Journal Article,3978.0,12.0,Patients pure teratoma postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection PC-RPLND specimen traditionally considered low risk disease progression objectives determine disease-related outcomes patients pure teratoma identified time PC-RPLND examine prognostic value clinical variables identified previously important predictors disease recurrence patients 1980 2003 97 patients metastatic nonseminomatous germ pure teratoma histology time PC-RPLND identified medical records patients reviewed retrospectively pertinent clinical treatment-related outcomes median follow-up 7.4 years 21 patients 22 developed recurrent disease PC-RPLND 5-year 10-year probabilities +/-standard error freedom disease recurrence 81 +/-4 76 +/-5 respectively postchemotherapy alpha-fetoprotein AFP level mediastinal involvement presentation statistically significant predictors disease recurrence multivariate 97 patients 9.3 died testis 4 patients died causes patients pure teratoma histology PC-RPLND mediastinal involvement presentation presence elevated AFP level PC-RPLND predicted unfavorable outcome absence mediastinal involvement normal AFP level confirm freedom disease recurrence Patients teratoma time PC-RPLND remained considerable risk disease progression unpredictable nature teratoma presence unrecognized active germ disease outside retroperitoneum,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 3092, 4845, 262, 3, 6241, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 1341, 5022, 2360, 4206, 47, 85, 515, 28, 154, 43, 9, 34, 91, 3, 2409, 1, 26, 45, 11, 6, 223, 3, 34, 139, 123, 1, 7, 54, 42, 3092, 4845, 108, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1341, 5022, 2, 6, 1004, 3, 177, 549, 1, 38, 682, 17, 11, 108, 373, 22, 305, 674, 1, 34, 146, 4, 46, 7, 59, 4376, 2, 1522, 1015, 7, 5, 113, 8052, 2280, 31, 30, 2, 3092, 4845, 784, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1341, 5022, 11, 108, 3, 484, 1064, 1, 46, 7, 11, 446, 894, 9, 5799, 38, 2, 24, 139, 123, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 67, 39, 60, 239, 7, 350, 276, 387, 34, 50, 1341, 5022, 3, 33, 111, 2, 79, 111, 3518, 260, 3444, 1, 3060, 29, 34, 146, 11, 865, 39, 2, 846, 33, 106, 3, 6241, 950, 6607, 4096, 301, 2, 2626, 799, 28, 1031, 11, 712, 93, 674, 1, 34, 146, 23, 331, 65, 762, 1, 1015, 7, 83, 27, 1016, 29, 12, 2, 39, 7, 1016, 29, 127, 1626, 4, 7, 5, 3092, 4845, 784, 28, 1341, 5022, 2626, 799, 28, 1031, 2, 3, 463, 1, 35, 804, 4096, 301, 348, 1341, 5022, 783, 35, 2483, 228, 3, 1127, 1, 2626, 799, 2, 295, 4096, 301, 137, 205, 44, 1843, 3060, 29, 34, 146, 7, 54, 42, 4845, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1341, 5022, 958, 28, 2658, 43, 9, 34, 91, 408, 1, 3, 8907, 2202, 1, 4845, 2, 3, 463, 1, 6055, 544, 2280, 31, 34, 2513, 3, 7765]",1773.0,19156903,Long-term outcome men teratoma postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection,6,0.020338983050847456
Longitudinal analysis and prognostic effect of cancer-testis antigen expression in multiple myeloma.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-02-03,"Reliable data on the persistence of tumor expression of cancer-testis (CT) antigens over time and consequent analyses of the effect of CT antigen expression on the clinical course of malignancies are crucial for their evaluation as diagnostic markers and immunotherapeutic targets. Applying conventional reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR, and Western blot, we did the first longitudinal study of CT antigen expression in multiple myeloma analyzing 330 bone marrow samples from 129 patients for the expression of four CT antigens (MAGE-C1/CT7, MAGE-C2/CT10, MAGE-A3, and SSX-2). CT antigens were frequently and surprisingly persistently expressed, indicating that down-regulation of these immunogenic targets does not represent a common tumor escape mechanism in myeloma. We observed strong correlations of CT antigen expression levels with the clinical course of myeloma patients as indicated by the number of bone marrow-residing plasma cells and peripheral paraprotein levels, suggesting a role for CT antigens as independent tumor markers. Investigating the prognostic value of CT antigen expression in myeloma patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we found that expression of genes, such as MAGE-C1, represents an important indicator of early relapse and dramatically reduced survival. Our findings suggest that CT antigens might promote the progression of multiple myeloma and especially MAGE-C1/CT7, which seems to play the role of a ""gatekeeper"" gene for other CT antigens, might characterize a more malignant phenotype. Importantly, our study also strongly supports the usefulness of CT antigens as diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as therapeutic targets in myeloma.",Journal Article,4004.0,68.0,Reliable persistence expression cancer-testis CT antigens time consequent effect CT antigen expression clinical course malignancies crucial evaluation diagnostic markers immunotherapeutic targets Applying conventional reverse transcription-PCR real-time PCR Western blot longitudinal CT antigen expression multiple myeloma analyzing 330 bone marrow 129 patients expression CT antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-C2/CT10 MAGE-A3 SSX-2 CT antigens frequently surprisingly persistently expressed indicating down-regulation immunogenic targets represent common escape mechanism myeloma observed strong correlations CT antigen expression levels clinical course myeloma patients indicated number bone marrow-residing plasma peripheral paraprotein levels suggesting role CT antigens independent markers Investigating prognostic value CT antigen expression myeloma patients allogeneic stem transplantation expression MAGE-C1 represents important indicator early relapse dramatically reduced survival findings suggest CT antigens promote progression multiple myeloma especially MAGE-C1/CT7 play role `` gatekeeper '' CT antigens characterize malignant phenotype Importantly strongly supports usefulness CT antigens diagnostic prognostic markers therapeutic targets myeloma,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2450, 74, 23, 3, 4108, 1, 30, 55, 1, 12, 7697, 425, 1575, 252, 98, 2, 8436, 318, 1, 3, 254, 1, 425, 448, 55, 23, 3, 38, 906, 1, 441, 32, 2653, 9, 136, 451, 22, 752, 525, 2, 3222, 637, 4798, 809, 1772, 866, 604, 1589, 98, 604, 2, 1521, 2639, 21, 205, 3, 157, 2380, 45, 1, 425, 448, 55, 4, 232, 4449, 7105, 581, 347, 29, 4649, 7, 9, 3, 55, 1, 294, 425, 1575, 4871, 6801, 10331, 4871, 6706, 26538, 4871, 7024, 2, 9328, 18, 425, 1575, 11, 746, 2, 5819, 8684, 570, 1716, 17, 1328, 863, 1, 46, 4190, 637, 1097, 44, 1231, 8, 186, 30, 3776, 670, 4, 21, 164, 1082, 2553, 1, 425, 448, 55, 148, 5, 3, 38, 906, 1, 7, 22, 1103, 20, 3, 207, 1, 581, 8230, 554, 37, 2, 672, 10938, 148, 802, 8, 200, 9, 425, 1575, 22, 306, 30, 525, 3103, 3, 177, 549, 1, 425, 448, 55, 4, 7, 50, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 21, 204, 17, 55, 1, 214, 225, 22, 4871, 6801, 1449, 35, 305, 3287, 1, 191, 429, 2, 2729, 405, 25, 114, 272, 309, 17, 425, 1575, 822, 1617, 3, 91, 1, 232, 2, 1093, 4871, 6801, 10331, 92, 2744, 6, 1343, 3, 200, 1, 8, 10899, 522, 145, 9, 127, 425, 1575, 822, 1507, 8, 80, 393, 1005, 1859, 114, 45, 120, 1327, 2304, 3, 5235, 1, 425, 1575, 22, 752, 2, 177, 525, 22, 149, 22, 189, 637, 4]",1626.0,19190130,Longitudinal prognostic effect cancer-testis antigen expression multiple myeloma,2,0.006779661016949152
Update on testicular germ cell tumors.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2009-05-01,"This overview discusses several important developments in testicular germ cell tumors in the past year. Genomic studies are examining gene expression as possible markers for disease relapse and chemotherapy resistance. Optimal posttreatment surveillance strategies continue to evolve. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection remains a prominent treatment modality, although the sequencing and extent of surgical intervention is controversial. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the gold standard for treatment of systemic disease.

Common variation in KITLG and at 5q31.3 predisposes to testicular germ cell cancer.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2009-05-31,"Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) have been expected to have a strong underlying genetic component. We conducted a genome-wide scan among 277 TGCT cases and 919 controls and found that seven markers at 12p22 within KITLG (c-KIT ligand) reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in discovery). In independent replication, TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major allele at rs3782179 and rs4474514 (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13; OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13, respectively).

Testicular germ cell tumors with sarcomatous components: an analysis of 33 cases.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2009-08-01,"The development of sarcomatous component (SC) in testicular germ cell tumor (GCT) is an uncommon phenomenon. We searched our surgical pathology files from 1985 to 2007 and identified 33 cases of testicular GCTs with SC. The average age of patients was 31 years. All patients underwent radical orchiectomy, which demonstrated a GCT in all patients except for 3 patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All testicular GCTs contained a teratomatous component. The GCTs were pure teratomas in 3 cases, and were mixed GCTs in the other cases. The SC was observed in primary testicular tumor (n=19), in metastasis (n=11), or in both primary testicular tumor and metastasis (n=3). The average percentage of the SC in the primary testicular GCT was 32% (range: 5% to 99%). The most common histologic type of SC was rhabdomyosarcoma (n=24), followed by high-grade unclassified sarcoma (n=5), rhabdomyosarcoma admixed with high-grade unclassified sarcoma (n=2), angiosarcoma (n=1), and low-grade myxoid sarcoma (n=1). Clinical follow-up information was available for 27 patients. Of the 13 patients whose SC was limited to the testicular GCT, 2 patients died of GCT not otherwise specified at 37 and 68 months, respectively; and 11 patients were free of disease at a mean of 46 months. Of the 14 patients with a SC in the metastasis, 7 patients died of GCT not otherwise specified at a mean of 95 months, and 7 patients were free of disease at a mean of 104 months. These results suggest that patients with a SC confined to the primary testicular GCT may not have a higher risk of mortality than those at a comparable stage without a SC.

Clin.

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was reviewed to identify patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2005. To study the potential impact of the introduction of rituximab on survival, we used the year 2000 as cutoff point. We identified 769 patients with testicular DLBCL. The median age at diagnosis was 68.0 years. The incidence of DLBCL increased over time, with the highest rate among whites (twice that of blacks). The median overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 4.6 years, whereas the disease-specific survival (DSS) rates at 3, 5, and 15 years were 71.5%, 62.4%, and 43.0%, respectively. Independent predictors of worse DSS were older age, diagnosis before 1986, advanced stage, left testicular involvement, and not having surgery and radiation. The use of radiation did not change significantly over time. When testicular and nodal DLBCL patients were analyzed together, testicular primary was an independent predictor of better OS and DSS. Unlike nodal DLBCL, DSS did not improve in the patients with testicular DLBCL diagnosed after the year 2000. The incidence of testicular DLBCL is increasing. Compared with nodal DLBCL, testicular DLBCL patients have a better overall prognosis but are at higher risk of late disease-related deaths.

Family history of cancer and malignant germ cell tumors in children: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer causes & control : CCC,Cancer Causes Control,2009-10-15,"Family history of testicular cancer is an established risk factor for adult testicular germ cell tumors (GCT). We evaluated the association between family history of cancer and pediatric GCT in a Children's Oncology Group case-control study that included 274 GCT cases (195 female and 79 male) diagnosed < age 15 years and 418 controls frequency matched to cases on sex and age. Family history data were collected through telephone interviews with biological mothers and fathers and unconditional logistic regression was used to evaluate associations with GCT adjusting for potential confounders. A family history of cancer with onset < age 40 years was associated with a reduced risk of GCT among female cases (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.28-0.89) and an increased risk among male cases (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.02-6.44). Male cases were more likely to report family history of melanoma compared with male controls (OR = 4.65, 95% CI 1.40-15.4).

"Phase II study of androgen synthesis inhibition with ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, and dutasteride in asymptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2009-11-03,"Increasing evidence indicates that enhanced intratumoral androgen synthesis contributes to prostate cancer progression after androgen deprivation therapy. This phase II study was designed to assess responses to blocking multiple steps in androgen synthesis with inhibitors of CYP17A1 (ketoconazole) and type I and II 5alpha-reductases (dutasteride) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Fifty-seven men with CRPC were continued on gonadal suppression and treated with ketoconazole (400 mg thrice daily), hydrocortisone (30 mg/AM, 10 mg/PM), and dutasteride (0.5 mg/d). Prostate-specific antigen response rate (> or =50% decline) was 56% (32 of 57; 95% confidence interval, 42.4-69.3%); the median duration of response was 20 months. In patients with measurable disease, 6 of 20 (30%) responded by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Median duration of treatment was 8 months; 9 patients remained on therapy with treatment durations censored at 18 to 32 months. Median time to progression was 14.5 months. Grade 3 toxicities occurred in 32% with only one reported grade 4 (thrombosis) toxicity. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate declined by 89%, androstenedione by 56%, and testosterone by 66%, and dihydrotestosterone declined to below detectable levels compared with baseline levels with testicular suppression alone. Median baseline levels and declines in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone were not statistically different in the responders versus nonresponders, and hormone levels were not significantly increased from nadir levels at relapse. The response proportion to ketoconazole, hydrocortisone, and dutasteride was at least comparable with previous studies of ketoconazole alone, whereas time to progression was substantially longer.

Defining the optimal treatment for clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer using decision analysis.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-16,"PURPOSE There is equipoise regarding the optimal treatment of clinical stage (CS) I nonseminomatous germ cell testicular cancer (NSGCT). Formal mechanisms that enable patients to consider cancer outcomes, treatment-related morbidity, and personal preferences are needed to facilitate decision making between retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), primary chemotherapy, and surveillance. METHODS Decision analysis was performed using a Markov model that incorporated likelihoods of survival, treatment-related morbidity, and utilities for seven undesired post-treatment health states to estimate the quality-adjusted survival (QAS) for each treatment option. Utilities were obtained from 24 hypothetical NSGCT patients using a visual analog (rating) scale and standard gamble. Results Overall, QAS associated with each treatment was high and differences in QAS were small. Surveillance was the preferred intervention for patients with a risk of relapse less than 33% and 37% using the rating scale and standard-gamble method of utility assessment, respectively. Active treatment was favored over surveillance for patients with relapse risk on surveillance greater than 33% and 37% by the rating scale (RPLND preferred) and standard-gamble methods (primary chemotherapy preferred), respectively. Substantial differences in average utilities were seen depending on the method used. By the rating scale, patients substantially devalued life in six of seven undesired health states but they were surprisingly tolerant of treatment-related morbidity using standard gamble. CONCLUSION A decision model has been developed for CS I NSGCT that estimates QAS for RPLND, primary chemotherapy, and surveillance by considering cancer outcomes, morbidity, and patient preferences. Surveillance was the preferred intervention for all except those patients at high risk for relapse.",Journal Article,3718.0,24.0,PURPOSE equipoise optimal treatment clinical stage CS nonseminomatous germ testicular NSGCT Formal mechanisms enable patients consider outcomes treatment-related morbidity personal preferences needed facilitate decision making retroperitoneal lymph node dissection RPLND primary chemotherapy surveillance METHODS Decision performed Markov model incorporated likelihoods survival treatment-related morbidity utilities seven undesired post-treatment health states estimate quality-adjusted survival QAS treatment option Utilities obtained 24 hypothetical NSGCT patients visual analog rating scale standard gamble Overall QAS associated treatment high differences QAS small Surveillance preferred intervention patients risk relapse 33 37 rating scale standard-gamble utility assessment respectively Active treatment favored surveillance patients relapse risk surveillance greater 33 37 rating scale RPLND preferred standard-gamble methods primary chemotherapy preferred respectively Substantial differences average utilities seen depending rating scale patients substantially devalued life seven undesired health states surprisingly tolerant treatment-related morbidity standard gamble decision model developed CS NSGCT estimates QAS RPLND primary chemotherapy surveillance considering outcomes morbidity patient preferences Surveillance preferred intervention patients high risk relapse,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 125, 16, 31544, 666, 3, 665, 24, 1, 38, 82, 2188, 70, 8052, 2280, 31, 12, 8134, 5057, 483, 17, 3047, 7, 6, 2419, 12, 123, 24, 139, 787, 2, 3008, 2875, 32, 575, 6, 1876, 948, 1079, 59, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 5022, 86, 56, 2, 617, 636, 948, 65, 10, 173, 75, 8, 6516, 202, 17, 2449, 58423, 1, 25, 24, 139, 787, 2, 7114, 9, 648, 25210, 539, 24, 341, 907, 6, 1191, 3, 372, 586, 25, 28963, 9, 296, 24, 1501, 7114, 11, 683, 29, 259, 7045, 8134, 7, 75, 8, 3046, 3497, 5477, 1124, 2, 260, 19561, 99, 63, 28963, 41, 5, 296, 24, 10, 64, 2, 362, 4, 28963, 11, 302, 617, 10, 3, 2514, 788, 9, 7, 5, 8, 43, 1, 429, 299, 76, 466, 2, 567, 75, 3, 5477, 1124, 2, 260, 19561, 596, 1, 1207, 455, 106, 544, 24, 10, 5269, 252, 617, 9, 7, 5, 429, 43, 23, 617, 378, 76, 466, 2, 567, 20, 3, 5477, 1124, 5022, 2514, 2, 260, 19561, 636, 86, 56, 2514, 106, 1281, 362, 4, 1011, 7114, 11, 527, 3221, 23, 3, 596, 95, 20, 3, 5477, 1124, 7, 2109, 58424, 358, 4, 437, 1, 648, 25210, 341, 907, 84, 491, 11, 5819, 12256, 1, 24, 139, 787, 75, 260, 19561, 1221, 8, 948, 202, 71, 85, 276, 9, 2188, 70, 8134, 17, 1423, 28963, 9, 5022, 86, 56, 2, 617, 20, 3075, 12, 123, 787, 2, 69, 2875, 617, 10, 3, 2514, 788, 9, 62, 2187, 135, 7, 28, 64, 43, 9, 429]",1819.0,19917846,Defining optimal treatment clinical stage nonseminomatous germ testicular decision,3,0.010169491525423728
Fertility of male survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-30,"This study was undertaken to determine the effect of treatment for childhood cancer on male fertility. We reviewed the fertility of male Childhood Cancer Survivor Study survivor and sibling cohorts who completed a questionnaire. We abstracted the chemotherapeutic agents administered, the cumulative dose of drug administered for selected drugs, and the doses and volumes of all radiation therapy from medical records. Risk factors for siring a pregnancy were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. The 6,224 survivors age 15 to 44 years who were not surgically sterile were less likely to sire a pregnancy than siblings (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, -0.49 to 0.63).

Cancer-testis antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-A3 promote the survival of multiple myeloma cells.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2009-12-16,"Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening disease and despite the introduction of stem cell transplantation and novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib most patients will relapse and develop chemoresistant disease. Therefore, alternative therapeutic modes for myeloma are needed and cancer-testis antigens such as MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-A3 have been suggested to represent a class of tumor-specific proteins particularly suited for targeted immunotherapies. Surprisingly, the biological role of cancer-testis genes in myeloma remains poorly understood. We performed the first investigation of the function of two cancer-testis antigens most commonly expressed in myeloma, MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-A3, using an RNA interference-based gene silencing model in myeloma cell lines. Functional assays were used to determine changes in proliferation, cell adhesion, chemosensitivity, colony formation, and apoptosis resulting from gene-specific silencing. We show that the investigated genes are not involved in regulating cell proliferation or adhesion; however, they play an important role in promoting the survival of myeloma cells. Accordingly, knock-down of MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-A3 led to the induction of apoptosis in the malignant plasma cells and, importantly, both genes were also essential for the survival of clonogenic myeloma precursors. Finally, silencing of cancer-testis genes further improved the response of myeloma cells to conventional therapies. Cancer-testis antigens such as MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-A3 play an important role in promoting the survival of myeloma cells and clonogenic precursors by reducing the rate of spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and might, therefore, represent attractive targets for novel myeloma-specific therapies.",Comparative Study,3688.0,66.0,Multiple myeloma life-threatening disease despite introduction stem transplantation novel agents thalidomide lenalidomide bortezomib patients relapse develop chemoresistant disease alternative therapeutic modes myeloma needed cancer-testis antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-A3 suggested represent class tumor-specific particularly suited targeted immunotherapies Surprisingly role cancer-testis myeloma remains poorly understood performed investigation function cancer-testis antigens commonly expressed myeloma MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-A3 RNA interference-based silencing model myeloma lines Functional determine changes proliferation adhesion chemosensitivity colony formation apoptosis resulting gene-specific silencing investigated involved regulating proliferation adhesion play important role promoting survival myeloma Accordingly knock-down MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-A3 led induction apoptosis malignant plasma importantly essential survival clonogenic myeloma precursors Finally silencing cancer-testis improved response myeloma conventional therapies Cancer-testis antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-A3 play important role promoting survival myeloma clonogenic precursors reducing rate spontaneous chemotherapy-induced apoptosis represent attractive targets novel myeloma-specific therapies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[232, 16, 8, 358, 3691, 34, 2, 550, 3, 2456, 1, 452, 31, 497, 2, 229, 183, 225, 22, 2159, 1288, 2, 819, 96, 7, 303, 429, 2, 690, 5530, 34, 673, 1091, 189, 8256, 9, 32, 575, 2, 12, 7697, 1575, 225, 22, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 7024, 47, 85, 1148, 6, 1231, 8, 1040, 1, 30, 112, 652, 823, 7247, 9, 238, 2811, 5819, 3, 1037, 200, 1, 12, 7697, 214, 4, 469, 1240, 1784, 21, 173, 3, 157, 940, 1, 3, 343, 1, 100, 12, 7697, 1575, 96, 841, 570, 4, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 7024, 75, 35, 893, 3182, 90, 145, 2077, 202, 4, 31, 285, 583, 1013, 11, 95, 6, 223, 400, 4, 457, 31, 2128, 5522, 1975, 1264, 2, 351, 1113, 29, 145, 112, 2077, 21, 514, 17, 3, 565, 214, 32, 44, 646, 4, 2681, 31, 457, 15, 2128, 137, 491, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 2388, 3, 25, 1, 37, 4705, 6252, 1328, 1, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 7024, 836, 6, 3, 504, 1, 351, 4, 3, 393, 554, 37, 2, 1859, 110, 214, 11, 120, 1452, 9, 3, 25, 1, 3798, 4881, 1368, 2077, 1, 12, 7697, 214, 195, 231, 3, 51, 1, 37, 6, 809, 235, 12, 7697, 1575, 225, 22, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 7024, 1343, 35, 305, 200, 4, 2388, 3, 25, 1, 37, 2, 3798, 4881, 20, 1818, 3, 116, 1, 3280, 2, 56, 277, 351, 2, 822, 673, 1231, 3059, 637, 9, 229, 6214, 112, 235]",1681.0,20015885,Cancer-testis antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-A3 promote survival multiple myeloma,31,0.10508474576271186
Mediastinal germ cell tumors with an angiosarcomatous component: a report of 12 cases.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2010-02-12,"The development of an angiosarcomatous component in germ cell tumors is rare. Here we studied 12 cases of mediastinal germ cell tumors with an angiosarcomatous component. All patients were men with a mean age of 34 years (range, 24-49 years). No patient had a documented testicular germ cell tumor. The mean size of mediastinal tumors was 12.9 cm (range, 5.5-16.0 cm). Grossly, the tumors were cystic with variegated hemorrhagic, mucinous, and fleshy solid areas. Microscopically, all tumors were composed of germ cell tumor. The most common germ cell tumor component was teratoma (n = 10); and other germ cell tumor components included seminoma (n = 3), yolk sac tumor (n = 3), embryonal carcinoma (n = 2), and choriocarcinoma (n = 1). The angiosarcomatous component was present in primary mediastinal tumors (n = 6), metastasis (n = 3), or both primary mediastinal tumor and metastasis (n = 3). The angiosarcomatous component accounted for an average of 30% (range, 5%-95%) of the primary mediastinal tumor. In addition, other non-germ cell components, including rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 3), leiomyosarcoma (n = 1), and poorly differentiated carcinoma (n = 1), were also present in the tumors. Of the 10 patients with follow-up available, all patients developed metastasis (n = 8) or local recurrence (n = 2); 7 died of disease at a mean of 33 months (range, 21-75 months), and 3 patients were alive at a mean of 75 months (range, 5-120 months).

Phase II multicenter study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone therapy in patients with docetaxel-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-02-16,"Persistence of ligand-mediated androgen receptor signaling has been documented in castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of CYP17, which is required for androgen biosynthesis in the testes, adrenal glands, and prostate tissue. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of AA in combination with prednisone to reduce the symptoms of secondary hyperaldosteronism that can occur with AA monotherapy. Fifty-eight men with progressive metastatic CRPC who experienced treatment failure with docetaxel-based chemotherapy received AA (1,000 mg daily) with prednisone (5 mg twice daily). Twenty-seven (47%) patients had received prior ketoconazole. The primary outcome was > or = 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, with objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and changes in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) and circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers. Safety was also evaluated. A > or = 50% decline in PSA was confirmed in 22 (36%) patients, including 14 (45%) of 31 ketoconazole-naïve and seven (26%) of 27 ketoconazole-pretreated patients. Partial responses were seen in four (18%) of 22 patients with RECIST-evaluable target lesions. Improved ECOG PS was seen in 28% of patients. Median time to PSA progression was 169 days (95% CI, 82 to 200 days). CTC conversions with treatment from > or = 5 to < 5 were noted in 10 (34%) of 29 patients. The majority of AA-related adverse events were grade 1 to 2, and no AA-related grade 4 events were seen. AA plus prednisone was well tolerated, with encouraging antitumor activity in heavily pretreated CRPC patients.

The total number of retroperitoneal lymph nodes resected impacts clinical outcome after chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer.,Urology,Urology,2010-03-17,"To evaluate the prognostic significance of the total number of lymph nodes obtained at postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND). After the multidisciplinary management of metastatic germ cell tumor, approximately 10%-15% of patients with the histologic finding of fibrosis or teratoma will suffer disease recurrence. Between 1989 and 2006, a total of 628 patients underwent PC-RPLND and were found to have either fibrosis or teratoma. After Institutional Review Board approval, complete clinical and pathologic data were obtained from our prospective testis cancer surgical database. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was constructed to evaluate the association of the total number of lymph nodes obtained at PC-RPLND on disease recurrence. On pathologic evaluation, 248 (57%) patients had fibrosis and 184 (43%) patients had teratoma. The median number of lymph nodes resected was 25 (interquartile range, 15-37). On multivariable analysis, increasing postchemotherapy nodal size and decreasing lymph node counts were significant predictors of disease recurrence (P=.01, .04, respectively). For patients with 10 nodes removed, the predicted 2-year relapse free probability was 90%, compared with 97% when 50 nodes were removed. Our data suggest that the total number of lymph nodes removed and analyzed is an independent predictor of disease recurrence after PC-RPLND. This has implications both for the urologist to assure completeness of resection and for the pathologist to meticulously assess the pathologic specimens.",Comparative Study,3597.0,30.0,evaluate prognostic significance total number lymph nodes obtained postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection PC-RPLND multidisciplinary management metastatic germ approximately 10 -15 patients histologic finding fibrosis teratoma suffer disease recurrence 1989 2006 total 628 patients underwent PC-RPLND fibrosis teratoma Institutional Review Board approval complete clinical pathologic obtained prospective testis surgical database Cox proportional hazards regression model constructed evaluate association total number lymph nodes obtained PC-RPLND disease recurrence pathologic evaluation 248 57 patients fibrosis 184 43 patients teratoma median number lymph nodes resected 25 interquartile range 15-37 multivariable increasing postchemotherapy nodal size decreasing lymph node counts significant predictors disease recurrence P=.01 .04 respectively patients 10 nodes removed predicted 2-year relapse free probability 90 compared 97 50 nodes removed suggest total number lymph nodes removed independent predictor disease recurrence PC-RPLND implications urologist assure completeness resection pathologist meticulously assess pathologic specimens,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 376, 3, 177, 724, 1, 3, 181, 207, 1, 263, 502, 683, 28, 6241, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 1341, 5022, 50, 3, 1643, 284, 1, 113, 2280, 31, 30, 705, 79, 167, 1, 7, 5, 3, 884, 1567, 1, 3000, 15, 4845, 303, 6506, 34, 146, 59, 3965, 2, 1324, 8, 181, 1, 12385, 7, 208, 1341, 5022, 2, 11, 204, 6, 47, 361, 3000, 15, 4845, 50, 1115, 206, 2620, 1814, 236, 38, 2, 510, 74, 11, 683, 29, 114, 482, 12, 221, 609, 8, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 202, 10, 2776, 6, 376, 3, 248, 1, 3, 181, 207, 1, 263, 502, 683, 28, 1341, 5022, 23, 34, 146, 23, 510, 451, 7100, 696, 7, 42, 3000, 2, 5894, 601, 7, 42, 4845, 3, 52, 207, 1, 263, 502, 1133, 10, 243, 2899, 184, 167, 567, 23, 658, 65, 602, 6241, 779, 444, 2, 2777, 263, 289, 1911, 11, 93, 674, 1, 34, 146, 19, 355, 755, 106, 9, 7, 5, 79, 502, 2264, 3, 783, 18, 111, 429, 115, 1320, 10, 424, 72, 5, 1015, 198, 212, 502, 11, 2264, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3, 181, 207, 1, 263, 502, 2264, 2, 311, 16, 35, 306, 980, 1, 34, 146, 50, 1341, 5022, 26, 71, 1268, 110, 9, 3, 8227, 6, 14799, 7507, 1, 170, 2, 9, 3, 5093, 6, 34855, 423, 3, 510, 623]",1515.0,20299079,total number retroperitoneal lymph nodes resected impacts clinical outcome chemotherapy metastatic testicular,4,0.013559322033898305

"Expression, epigenetic regulation, and humoral immunogenicity of cancer-testis antigens in chronic myeloid leukemia.",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2010-04-20,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens represent attractive targets for tumor immunotherapy based on their tumor-restricted expression and immunogenicity. However, a broad picture of the expression of CT antigens and associated humoral immune responses in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still missing. We screened CML cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples from healthy donors by RT-PCR for the expression of 31 CT antigens before and after treatment with epigenetic agents. Expression of tumor-restricted antigens was further examined in 60 CML patients and humoral immune responses against 15 CT antigens were screened by ELISA. In untreated cell lines we detected the expression of 17 CT antigens that were absent from normal BM. Expression of most antigens increased following demethylating treatment with 5'-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine. In these samples, only PRAME was repeatedly detected and expression correlated with several clinicopathological parameters and decreased overall survival. We further show that a lower frequency of PRAME-positive samples during imatinib treatment was not caused by gene-specific downregulation. Analyzing the patients' antibody responses we found that the vast majority of patients lacked spontaneous immunity against CT antigens including PRAME. CT antigen expression can be increased by the application of epigenetic agents and the expression of PRAME correlates with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival in patients with CML, but does not lead to humoral immune responses.

Abiraterone acetate: a promising drug for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2010-05-01,"Abiraterone acetate (CB7630), a pregnenolone analog, is an orally administered small molecule that irreversibly inhibits a rate-limiting enzyme in androgen biosynthesis, CYP17, and blocks the synthesis of androgens in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate without causing adrenal insufficiency. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate is well tolerated and shows promising clinical activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The recommended Phase II dose of abiraterone acetate is 1000 mg orally daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Side effects are minimal and mostly associated with secondary mineralocorticoid excess, owing to a compensatory increase in upstream steroids, such as deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone. These include hypertension, hypokalemia and edema and are easily manageable with a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist, such as eplerenone, or low-dose corticosteroids.

Primary outcomes included marker accuracy to predict the impact of decisions on outcomes. Secondary outcomes included proportions of patients with elevated markers and statistical tests of elevations as prognostic factors. An expert panel developed consensus guidelines based on data from 82 reports. No studies directly compared outcomes of decisions with versus without marker assays. The search identified few prospective studies and no randomized controlled trials; most were retrospective series. Lacking data on primary outcomes, most Panel recommendations are based on secondary outcomes (relapse rates and time to relapse). The Panel recommended against using markers to screen for GCTs, to decide whether orchiectomy is indicated, or to select treatment for patients with cancer of unknown primary. To stage patients with testicular nonseminomas, the Panel recommended measuring three markers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) before and after orchiectomy and before chemotherapy for those with extragonadal nonseminomas. They also recommended measuring AFP and hCG shortly before retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and at the start of each chemotherapy cycle for nonseminoma, and periodically to monitor for relapse. The Panel recommended measuring postorchiectomy hCG and LDH for patients with seminoma and preorchiectomy elevations.

Expression of cancer/testis antigens in prostate cancer is associated with disease progression.,The Prostate,Prostate,2010-12-01,"The cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are a unique group of proteins normally expressed in germ cells but aberrantly expressed in several types of cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). However, their role in PCa has not been fully explored. CTA expression profiling in PCa samples and cell lines was done utilizing a custom microarray that contained probes for two-thirds of all CTAs. The data were validated by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Functional studies were carried out by silencing gene expression with siRNA. DNA methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR. A majority of CTAs expressed in PCa are located on the X chromosome (CT-X antigens). Several CT-X antigens from the MAGEA/CSAG subfamilies are coordinately upregulated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) but not in primary PCa. In contrast, PAGE4 is highly upregulated in primary PCa but is virtually silent in CRPC. Further, there was good correlation between the extent of promoter DNA methylation and CTA expression. Finally, silencing the expression of MAGEA2 the most highly upregulated member, significantly impaired proliferation of prostate cancer cells while increasing their chemosensitivity. Considered together, the remarkable stage-specific expression patterns of the CT-X antigens strongly suggests that these CTAs may serve as unique biomarkers that could potentially be used to distinguish men with aggressive disease who need treatment from men with indolent disease not requiring immediate intervention. The data also suggest that the CT-X antigens may be novel therapeutic targets for CRPC for which there are currently no effective therapeutics.",Journal Article,3338.0,39.0,cancer/testis antigens CTAs unique group normally expressed germ aberrantly expressed types including prostate PCa role PCa fully explored CTA expression profiling PCa lines utilizing custom microarray contained probes two-thirds CTAs validated quantitative PCR Q-PCR Functional studies carried silencing expression siRNA DNA methylation determined methylation-specific PCR majority CTAs expressed PCa located X chromosome CT-X antigens CT-X antigens MAGEA/CSAG subfamilies coordinately upregulated castrate-resistant prostate CRPC primary PCa contrast PAGE4 highly upregulated primary PCa virtually silent CRPC good correlation extent promoter DNA methylation CTA expression Finally silencing expression MAGEA2 highly upregulated member significantly impaired proliferation prostate increasing chemosensitivity Considered remarkable stage-specific expression patterns CT-X antigens strongly suggests CTAs serve unique biomarkers potentially distinguish men aggressive disease need treatment men indolent disease requiring immediate intervention suggest CT-X antigens novel therapeutic targets CRPC currently effective therapeutics,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 12, 7697, 1575, 13971, 32, 8, 991, 87, 1, 652, 6150, 570, 4, 2280, 37, 84, 5619, 570, 4, 392, 630, 1, 163, 141, 12, 1265, 137, 136, 200, 4, 1265, 71, 44, 85, 1910, 1443, 8583, 55, 1080, 4, 1265, 347, 2, 31, 285, 10, 1822, 2600, 8, 6980, 1727, 17, 3070, 3701, 9, 100, 5438, 1, 62, 13971, 3, 74, 11, 938, 20, 1156, 604, 4170, 604, 583, 94, 11, 2629, 1205, 20, 2077, 145, 55, 5, 1919, 261, 569, 10, 509, 20, 569, 112, 604, 8, 686, 1, 13971, 570, 4, 1265, 32, 2308, 23, 3, 1006, 1170, 425, 1006, 1575, 392, 425, 1006, 1575, 29, 3, 59115, 46096, 46097, 32, 13845, 2684, 4, 4435, 436, 12, 1752, 84, 44, 4, 86, 1265, 4, 748, 39363, 16, 561, 2684, 4, 86, 1265, 84, 16, 5860, 9890, 4, 1752, 195, 125, 10, 1178, 816, 59, 3, 1039, 1, 973, 261, 569, 2, 8583, 55, 1368, 2077, 3, 55, 1, 59116, 3, 96, 561, 2684, 2693, 97, 2364, 457, 1, 12, 37, 369, 602, 136, 5522, 515, 1162, 3, 3813, 82, 112, 55, 764, 1, 3, 425, 1006, 1575, 1327, 844, 17, 46, 13971, 68, 1833, 22, 991, 582, 17, 359, 751, 40, 95, 6, 3081, 325, 5, 571, 34, 54, 594, 24, 29, 325, 5, 2316, 34, 44, 1888, 2181, 788, 3, 74, 120, 309, 17, 3, 425, 1006, 1575, 68, 40, 229, 189, 637, 9, 1752, 9, 92, 125, 32, 694, 77, 323, 1943]",1592.0,20583133,Expression cancer/testis antigens prostate associated disease progression,7,0.023728813559322035
Testicular cancer survivorship: research strategies and recommendations.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2010-06-28,"Testicular cancer represents the most curable solid tumor, with a 10-year survival rate of more than 95%. Given the young average age at diagnosis, it is estimated that effective treatment approaches, in particular, platinum-based chemotherapy, have resulted in an average gain of several decades of life. This success, however, is offset by the emergence of considerable long-term morbidity, including second malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hypogonadism, decreased fertility, and psychosocial problems. Data on underlying genetic or molecular factors that might identify those patients at highest risk for late sequelae are sparse. Genome-wide association studies and other translational molecular approaches now provide opportunities to identify testicular cancer survivors at greatest risk for therapy-related complications to develop evidence-based long-term follow-up guidelines and interventional strategies. We review research priorities identified during an international workshop devoted to testicular cancer survivors. Recommendations include 1) institution of lifelong follow-up of testicular cancer survivors within a large cohort setting to ascertain risks of emerging toxicities and the evolution of known late sequelae, 2) development of comprehensive risk prediction models that include treatment factors and genetic modifiers of late sequelae, 3) elucidation of the effect(s) of decades-long exposure to low serum levels of platinum, 4) assessment of the overall burden of medical and psychosocial morbidity, and 5) the eventual formulation of evidence-based long-term follow-up guidelines and interventions.

Expression and prognostic relevance of MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-C2/CT10 in osteolytic lesions of patients with multiple myeloma.,Experimental and molecular pathology,Exp. Mol. Pathol.,2010-07-14,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are promising targets for antigen-specific therapy of multiple myeloma (MM). Osteolytic lesions represent the most common clinical manifestation of myeloma and it is possible that osseous myeloma lesions differ from bone-infiltrating tumor cells with regard to the extent of CT antigen expression based on the epigenetic regulation of these genes. We, therefore, performed the first analysis of CT antigen expression in osteolytic lesions of myeloma patients to further define the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value of these proteins. Lytic bone samples were obtained from MM patients during surgical interventions and a tissue microarray was constructed. 105 bone samples and 24 bone marrow biopsies were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies against CT antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-C2/CT10 and Ki-67. MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-C2/CT10 were frequently expressed in osteolytic lesions (46% and 54%) and bone marrow (75% and 54%). Expression of MAGE-C1/CT7 was significantly more frequent in patients with advanced stage of disease (p=0.023) and with a chromosomal deletion 17p13 (p53) (p=0.047). Samples with more than 75% MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing myeloma cells showed a higher proliferative rate (indicated by the expression of Ki67) than those with less than 25% MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing cells (p=0.011). Moreover, a content of ≥50% MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing myeloma cells in a sample was associated with reduced overall survival (p=0.013). Our results, therefore, suggest that expression of MAGE-C1/CT7 and MAGE-C2/CT10 in osteolytic lesions of myeloma patients can be used for diagnostic, prognostic, as well as immunotherapeutic purposes.",Journal Article,3478.0,29.0,Cancer-testis CT antigens promising targets antigen-specific therapy multiple myeloma MM Osteolytic lesions represent common clinical manifestation myeloma possible osseous myeloma lesions differ bone-infiltrating regard extent CT antigen expression based epigenetic regulation performed CT antigen expression osteolytic lesions myeloma patients define diagnostic prognostic therapeutic value Lytic bone obtained MM patients surgical interventions tissue microarray constructed 105 bone 24 bone marrow biopsies stained immunohistochemically antibodies CT antigens MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-C2/CT10 Ki-67 MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-C2/CT10 frequently expressed osteolytic lesions 46 54 bone marrow 75 54 Expression MAGE-C1/CT7 significantly frequent patients advanced stage disease p=0.023 chromosomal deletion 17p13 p53 p=0.047 75 MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing myeloma showed higher proliferative rate indicated expression Ki67 25 MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing p=0.011 content ≥50 MAGE-C1/CT7 expressing myeloma associated reduced overall survival p=0.013 suggest expression MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-C2/CT10 osteolytic lesions myeloma patients diagnostic prognostic immunotherapeutic purposes,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 7697, 425, 1575, 32, 721, 637, 9, 448, 112, 36, 1, 232, 321, 9570, 406, 1231, 3, 96, 186, 38, 6746, 1, 2, 192, 16, 899, 17, 5230, 406, 1505, 29, 3417, 2097, 30, 37, 5, 2539, 6, 3, 1039, 1, 425, 448, 55, 90, 23, 3, 1418, 863, 1, 46, 214, 21, 673, 173, 3, 157, 65, 1, 425, 448, 55, 4, 9570, 406, 1, 7, 6, 195, 1107, 3, 752, 177, 2, 189, 549, 1, 46, 652, 6148, 347, 11, 683, 29, 321, 7, 190, 221, 1151, 2, 8, 246, 1727, 10, 2776, 3263, 347, 2, 259, 581, 1154, 11, 3386, 6347, 5, 890, 480, 425, 1575, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 6706, 26538, 2, 2311, 598, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 6706, 26538, 11, 746, 570, 4, 9570, 406, 641, 2, 667, 2, 581, 481, 2, 667, 55, 1, 4871, 6801, 10331, 10, 97, 80, 908, 4, 7, 5, 131, 82, 1, 34, 19, 13, 4482, 2, 5, 8, 1860, 1528, 7526, 624, 19, 13, 5296, 347, 5, 80, 76, 481, 4871, 6801, 10331, 1046, 37, 224, 8, 142, 2441, 116, 1103, 20, 3, 55, 1, 3654, 76, 135, 5, 299, 76, 243, 4871, 6801, 10331, 1046, 37, 19, 13, 3651, 1393, 8, 2457, 1, 5660, 4871, 6801, 10331, 1046, 37, 4, 8, 1000, 10, 41, 5, 405, 63, 25, 19, 13, 3612, 114, 99, 673, 309, 17, 55, 1, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2, 4871, 6706, 26538, 4, 9570, 406, 1, 7, 122, 40, 95, 9, 752, 177, 22, 149, 22, 3222, 4624]",1557.0,20621094,Expression prognostic relevance MAGE-C1/CT7 MAGE-C2/CT10 osteolytic lesions patients multiple myeloma,1,0.003389830508474576
Medical radiation exposure and risk of retinoblastoma resulting from new germline RB1 mutation.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2011-05-01,"Although ionizing radiation induces germline mutations in animals, human studies of radiation-exposed populations have not detected an effect. We conducted a case-control study of sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma, which results from a new germline RB1 mutation, to investigate gonadal radiation exposure of parents from medical sources before their child's conception. Parents of 206 cases from nine North American institutions and 269 controls participated; fathers of 184 cases and 223 friend and relative controls and mothers of 204 cases and 260 controls provided information in telephone interviews on their medical radiation exposure. Cases provided DNA for RB1 mutation testing. Of common procedures, lower gastrointestinal (GI) series conferred the highest estimated dose to testes and ovaries. Paternal history of lower GI series was associated with increased risk of retinoblastoma in the child [matched odds ratio (OR) = 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-11.2, two-sided p = 0.02], as was estimated total testicular dose from all procedures combined (OR for highest dose=3.9, 95% CI = 1.2-14.4, p = 0.02). Maternal history of lower GI series was also associated with increased risk (OR = 7.6, 95% CI = 2.8-20.7, p < 0.001) as was the estimated total dose (OR for highest dose = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.4-7.0, p = 0.005). The RB1 mutation spectrum in cases of exposed parents did not differ from that of other cases.

Stillbirth and neonatal death in relation to radiation exposure before conception: a retrospective cohort study.,"Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2010-07-23,"The reproductive implications of mutagenic treatments given to children with cancer are not clear. By studying the risk of untoward pregnancy outcomes, we indirectly assessed the risk of transmission of germline damage to the offspring of survivors of childhood cancer who were given radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We did a retrospective cohort analysis, within the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), of the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death among the offspring of men and women who had survived childhood cancer. Patients in CCSS were younger than 21 years at initial diagnosis of an eligible cancer, were treated at 25 US institutions and one Canadian institution, and had survived for at least 5 years after diagnosis. We quantified the chemotherapy given to patients, and the preconception radiation doses to the testes, ovaries, uterus, and pituitary gland, and related these to the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death using Poisson regression analysis. Among 1148 men and 1657 women who had survived childhood cancer, there were 4946 pregnancies. Irradiation of the testes (16 [1%] of 1270; adjusted relative risk 0.8 [95% CI 0.4-1.6]; mean dose 0.53 Gy [SD 1.40]) and pituitary gland (17 [3%] of 510, 1.1 [0.5-2.4] for more than 20.00 Gy; mean dose 10.20 Gy [13.0] for women), and chemotherapy with alkylating drugs (26 [2%] of 1195 women, 0.9 [0.5-1.5]; ten [1%] of 732 men, 1.2 [0.5-2.5]) were not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth or neonatal death. Uterine and ovarian irradiation significantly increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal death at doses greater than 10.00 Gy (five [18%] of 28, 9.1 [3.4-24.6]). For girls treated before menarche, irradiation of the uterus and ovaries at doses as low as 1.00-2.49 Gy significantly increased the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death (three [4%] of 69, 4.7 [1.2-19.0]). Our findings do not support concern about heritable genetic changes affecting the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death in the offspring of men exposed to gonadal irradiation.

Genome-wide association studies of cancer predisposition.,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am.,2010-10-01,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now been performed in nearly all common malignancies and have identified more than 100 common genetic risk variants that confer a modest increased risk of cancer. For most discovered germline risk variants, the per allele effect size is small (<1.5) and the biologic mechanism of the detected association remains unexplained. Exceptions are the risk variants identified in JAK2 in myeloproliferative neoplasm and in the KITLG gene in testicular cancer, which are each associated with nearly a 3-fold increased risk of disease. GWAS have provided an efficient approach to identifying common, low-penetrance risk variants, and have implicated several novel cancer susceptibility loci. However, the identified low-penetrance risk variants explain only a small fraction of the heritability of cancer and the clinical usefulness of using these variants for cancer-risk prediction is to date limited.

Frequent MAGE mutations in human melanoma.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2010-09-16,"Cancer/testis (CT) genes are expressed only in the germ line and certain tumors and are most frequently located on the X-chromosome (the CT-X genes). Amongst the best studied CT-X genes are those encoding several MAGE protein families. The function of MAGE proteins is not well understood, but several have been shown to potentially influence the tumorigenic phenotype. We undertook a mutational analysis of coding regions of four CT-X MAGE genes, MAGEA1, MAGEA4, MAGEC1, MAGEC2 and the ubiquitously expressed MAGEE1 in human melanoma samples. We first examined cell lines established from tumors and matching blood samples from 27 melanoma patients. We found that melanoma cell lines from 37% of patients contained at least one mutated MAGE gene. The frequency of mutations in the coding regions of individual MAGE genes varied from 3.7% for MAGEA1 and MAGEA4 to 14.8% for MAGEC2. We also examined 111 fresh melanoma samples collected from 86 patients. In this case, samples from 32% of the patients exhibited mutations in one or more MAGE genes with the frequency of mutations in individual MAGE genes ranging from 6% in MAGEA1 to 16% in MAGEC1.

Tumor antigen acrosin binding protein normalizes mitotic spindle function to promote cancer cell proliferation.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-09-28,"Cancer cells manage to divide in the context of gross chromosomal abnormalities. These abnormalities can promote bypass of normal restraints on cell proliferation but at a cost of mitotic vulnerabilities that can be attacked by chemotherapy. Determining how cancer cells balance these issues may permit chemotherapeutic sensitivity to be leveraged more efficiently. From a pan-genomic small interfering RNA screen for modifiers of chemoresponsiveness, we identified the tumor antigen acrosin binding protein (ACRBP)/OY-TES-1 as a specifier of paclitaxel resistance. ACRBP expression is normally restricted to the testes but is detected in a wide variety of cancers, including most ovarian cancers. We found that ACRBP is both necessary and sufficient for paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian tumor explants. Moreover, high ACRBP expression correlated with reduced survival time and faster relapse among ovarian cancer patients. We identified the mitotic spindle protein NuMA as an ACRBP-interacting protein that could account for the effects of ACRBP on paclitaxel sensitivity. In cancer cells, ACRBP restricted a NuMA-dependent abrogation of a mitotic spindle assembly that is otherwise pathologic. As a consequence, ACRBP depletion resulted in mitotic errors and reduced proliferative fitness that could be rescued by NuMA codepletion. We propose that the codependent relationship of ACRBP and NuMA in cancer cells reflects their passage through a selection bottleneck during tumor evolution, one which requires the acquisition of traits that normalize mitotic perturbations that originally drove the plasticity of a preneoplastic genome. The molecular definition of such traits as defined by the ACRBP-NuMA complex may represent conceptually ideal intervention targets based on the wide therapeutic windows they may offer.",Journal Article,3402.0,36.0,manage divide context gross chromosomal abnormalities abnormalities promote bypass normal restraints proliferation cost mitotic vulnerabilities attacked chemotherapy Determining balance issues permit chemotherapeutic sensitivity leveraged efficiently pan-genomic small interfering RNA screen modifiers chemoresponsiveness identified antigen acrosin binding ACRBP /OY-TES-1 specifier paclitaxel resistance ACRBP expression normally restricted testes detected wide variety including ovarian ACRBP necessary sufficient paclitaxel resistance ovarian lines ovarian explants high ACRBP expression correlated reduced survival time faster relapse ovarian patients identified mitotic spindle NuMA ACRBP-interacting account effects ACRBP paclitaxel sensitivity ACRBP restricted NuMA-dependent abrogation mitotic spindle assembly pathologic consequence ACRBP depletion resulted mitotic errors reduced proliferative fitness rescued NuMA codepletion propose codependent relationship ACRBP NuMA reflects passage selection bottleneck evolution requires acquisition traits normalize mitotic perturbations originally drove plasticity preneoplastic genome molecular definition traits defined ACRBP-NuMA complex represent conceptually ideal intervention targets based wide therapeutic windows offer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 37, 4001, 6, 15901, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 1789, 1860, 1171, 46, 1171, 122, 1617, 5481, 1, 295, 59402, 23, 31, 457, 84, 28, 8, 835, 1, 2346, 9614, 17, 122, 40, 59403, 20, 56, 2196, 832, 12, 37, 3459, 46, 1553, 68, 5634, 1573, 485, 6, 40, 14319, 80, 4143, 29, 8, 3055, 572, 302, 3449, 893, 2413, 9, 5663, 1, 39436, 21, 108, 3, 30, 448, 59404, 791, 178, 22634, 39437, 21037, 14, 22, 8, 59405, 1, 490, 251, 22634, 55, 16, 6150, 2016, 6, 3, 13100, 84, 16, 530, 4, 8, 1019, 1362, 1, 163, 141, 96, 163, 21, 204, 17, 22634, 16, 110, 1493, 2, 1952, 9, 490, 251, 4, 12, 31, 285, 2, 30, 9774, 1393, 64, 22634, 55, 438, 5, 405, 25, 98, 2, 5308, 429, 107, 12, 7, 21, 108, 3, 2346, 4052, 178, 25285, 22, 35, 22634, 5505, 178, 17, 359, 1967, 9, 3, 176, 1, 22634, 23, 490, 485, 4, 12, 37, 22634, 2016, 8, 25285, 470, 8589, 1, 8, 2346, 4052, 7210, 17, 16, 2632, 510, 22, 8, 4177, 22634, 2286, 627, 4, 2346, 4612, 2, 405, 2441, 5959, 17, 359, 40, 7008, 20, 25285, 44479, 21, 2548, 17, 3, 39438, 858, 1, 22634, 2, 25285, 4, 12, 37, 5224, 136, 7740, 298, 8, 881, 26563, 190, 30, 2554, 104, 92, 1706, 3, 3405, 1, 8546, 17, 13633, 2346, 7013, 17, 5045, 14751, 3, 8070, 1, 8, 9980, 898, 3, 219, 2470, 1, 225, 8546, 22, 395, 20, 3, 22634, 25285, 840, 68, 1231, 13825, 3662, 788, 637, 90, 23, 3, 1019, 189, 18444, 491, 68, 1918]",1800.0,20876808,antigen acrosin binding normalizes mitotic spindle function promote proliferation,0,0.0
Metabolic syndrome after hormone-modifying therapy: risks associated with antineoplastic therapy.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2010-08-01,"The incidence of metabolic syndrome is rapidly increasing. Metabolic syndrome is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality secondary to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and hepatic dysfunction. A body of evidence has already implicated metabolic syndrome as a cancer risk factor; emerging evidence now suggests that cancer survivors themselves may be at risk for developing metabolic syndrome as a result of their anti-cancer therapy. Treatment of both breast cancer and prostate cancer often involves hormone-modifying agents that have been linked to features of metabolic syndrome. Androgen suppression in men with prostate cancer is associated with dyslipidemia, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. Anti-estrogen therapy in women with breast cancer can affect lipid profiles, cardiovascular risk, and liver function.

In addition, several emerging therapies, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and targeted kinase inhibitors, are increasingly associated with some features of metabolic syndrome.

Contemporary lymph node counts during primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.,Urology,Urology,2010-12-15,"Recent observations suggest that surgeon volume is associated with lymph node counts during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). We report our contemporary single-surgeon experience with lymph node counts during primary RPLND for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Using the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Testis Cancer Registry, we identified 124 consecutive patients treated with primary RPLND by a single experienced surgeon for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors between 2004 and 2008. Predictors of positive nodes and number of positive nodes were evaluated with logistic and linear regression models adjusting for year of surgery and clinical stage. Positive lymph nodes were observed in 37 patients (30%), whereas 87 patients (70%) were pN0. Mean total node count was 51 (standard deviation [SD] = 23) during the 5-year study period. Mean node counts for the paracaval, interaortocaval, and paraaortic regions were 8 (SD = 6), 17 (SD = 9), and 26 (SD = 15), respectively. In a multivariate analysis, higher total node count was significantly associated with finding positive nodes (odds ratio = 1.02 for each additional node counted; P = .037) and finding multiple positive nodes (linear regression coefficient = 0.04 for each additional node counted; P = .004). Year of surgery (P < .001) was associated with higher total node counts, whereas clinical stage and pathologist were not (P > .5 for each). The average total node count for a primary RPLND by an experienced surgeon is approximately 50 nodes, with nearly half of the nodes originating in the paraaortic region. These results will be useful when assessing the adequacy of lymph node dissections for testis, renal, and upper tract urothelial malignancies.",Journal Article,3324.0,11.0,Recent observations suggest surgeon volume associated lymph node counts retroperitoneal lymph node dissection RPLND report contemporary single-surgeon experience lymph node counts primary RPLND nonseminomatous germ Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center Testis Registry identified 124 consecutive patients treated primary RPLND single experienced surgeon nonseminomatous germ 2004 2008 Predictors positive nodes number positive nodes evaluated logistic linear regression models adjusting year surgery clinical stage Positive lymph nodes observed 37 patients 30 87 patients 70 pN0 Mean total node count 51 standard deviation SD 23 5-year period Mean node counts paracaval interaortocaval paraaortic regions 8 SD 6 17 SD 9 26 SD 15 respectively multivariate higher total node count significantly associated finding positive nodes odds ratio 1.02 additional node counted P .037 finding multiple positive nodes linear regression coefficient 0.04 additional node counted P .004 Year surgery P .001 associated higher total node counts clinical stage pathologist P .5 average total node count primary RPLND experienced surgeon approximately 50 nodes nearly half nodes originating paraaortic region useful assessing adequacy lymph node dissections testis renal upper tract urothelial malignancies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[435, 2172, 309, 17, 1897, 433, 16, 41, 5, 263, 289, 1911, 190, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 5022, 21, 414, 114, 2667, 226, 1897, 730, 5, 263, 289, 1911, 190, 86, 5022, 9, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 75, 3, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 12, 1608, 21, 108, 2834, 935, 7, 73, 5, 86, 5022, 20, 8, 226, 592, 1897, 9, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 59, 1131, 2, 1375, 674, 1, 109, 502, 2, 207, 1, 109, 502, 11, 194, 5, 812, 2, 1646, 320, 274, 1358, 9, 111, 1, 152, 2, 38, 82, 109, 263, 502, 11, 164, 4, 567, 7, 201, 547, 912, 7, 431, 11, 7789, 313, 181, 289, 1276, 10, 725, 260, 3348, 1270, 382, 190, 3, 33, 111, 45, 727, 313, 289, 1911, 9, 3, 38371, 38370, 2, 7401, 1374, 11, 66, 1270, 49, 269, 1270, 83, 2, 432, 1270, 167, 106, 4, 8, 331, 65, 142, 181, 289, 1276, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1567, 109, 502, 610, 197, 14, 588, 9, 296, 402, 289, 12252, 19, 5171, 2, 1567, 232, 109, 502, 1646, 320, 3200, 13, 755, 9, 296, 402, 289, 12252, 19, 1520, 111, 1, 152, 19, 144, 10, 41, 5, 142, 181, 289, 1911, 547, 38, 82, 2, 5093, 11, 44, 19, 33, 9, 296, 3, 1011, 181, 289, 1276, 9, 8, 86, 5022, 20, 35, 592, 1897, 16, 705, 212, 502, 5, 1857, 1303, 1, 3, 502, 6794, 4, 3, 7401, 1053, 46, 99, 303, 40, 999, 198, 1977, 3, 6760, 1, 263, 289, 6894, 9, 2, 1726, 1696, 1472, 441]",1646.0,21109294,Contemporary lymph node counts primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection,2,0.006779661016949152
Epitope hierarchy of spontaneous CD4+ T cell responses to LAGE-1.,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",J. Immunol.,2010-12-03,"NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 represent highly homologous cancer-germline Ags frequently coexpressed by many human cancers, but not by normal tissues, except testis. In contrast to NY-ESO-1, little is known about spontaneous immune responses to LAGE-1. In the current study, we report on spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4(+) T cells isolated from PBLs of patients with advanced LAGE-1(+)/NY-ESO-1(+) melanoma and directed against three promiscuous and immunodominant epitopes. Strikingly, although the three LAGE-1-derived epitopes are highly homologous to NY-ESO-1-derived epitopes, LAGE-1-specific CD4(+) T cells did not cross-react with NY-ESO-1. LAGE-1-specific CD4(+) T cells produced Th1-type and/or Th2-type cytokines and did not exert inhibitory effects on allogenic T cells. We observed that most patients with spontaneous NY-ESO-1-specific responses exhibited spontaneous CD4(+) T cell responses to at least one of the three immunodominant LAGE-1 epitopes. Additionally, nearly half of the patients with spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4(+) T cell responses had circulating LAGE-1-specific Abs that recognized epitopes located in the C-terminal portion of LAGE-1, which is distinct from NY-ESO-1. Collectively, our findings define the hierarchy of immunodominance of spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in patients with advanced melanoma. These findings demonstrate the capability of LAGE-1 to stimulate integrated cellular and humoral immune responses that do not cross-react with NY-ESO-1. Therefore, they provide a strong rationale for the inclusion of LAGE-1 peptides or protein in vaccine trials for patients with NY-ESO-1(+)/LAGE-1(+) tumors.",Comparative Study,3336.0,6.0,NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1 represent highly homologous cancer-germline Ags frequently coexpressed human normal tissues testis contrast NY-ESO-1 little known spontaneous immune responses LAGE-1 current report spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4 isolated PBLs patients advanced LAGE-1 /NY-ESO-1 melanoma directed promiscuous immunodominant epitopes Strikingly LAGE-1-derived epitopes highly homologous NY-ESO-1-derived epitopes LAGE-1-specific CD4 cross-react NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1-specific CD4 produced Th1-type and/or Th2-type cytokines exert inhibitory effects allogenic observed patients spontaneous NY-ESO-1-specific responses exhibited spontaneous CD4 responses immunodominant LAGE-1 epitopes Additionally nearly half patients spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4 responses circulating LAGE-1-specific Abs recognized epitopes located C-terminal portion LAGE-1 distinct NY-ESO-1 Collectively findings define hierarchy immunodominance spontaneous LAGE-1-specific CD4 responses patients advanced melanoma findings demonstrate capability LAGE-1 stimulate integrated cellular humoral immune responses cross-react NY-ESO-1 provide strong rationale inclusion LAGE-1 peptides vaccine trials patients NY-ESO-1 /LAGE-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2906, 3143, 14, 2, 12348, 14, 1231, 561, 3894, 12, 1009, 6596, 746, 10185, 20, 445, 171, 163, 84, 44, 20, 295, 742, 2187, 4, 748, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 1215, 16, 440, 545, 3280, 250, 253, 6, 12348, 14, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 414, 23, 3280, 12348, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 37, 1355, 29, 11579, 1, 7, 5, 131, 12348, 14, 2906, 3143, 14, 2, 1166, 480, 169, 20333, 2, 15121, 4915, 6787, 242, 3, 169, 12348, 14, 526, 4915, 32, 561, 3894, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 526, 4915, 12348, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 37, 205, 44, 1383, 11651, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 12348, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 37, 1687, 4714, 267, 2, 15, 8358, 267, 1886, 2, 205, 44, 5448, 1810, 176, 23, 15122, 102, 37, 21, 164, 17, 96, 7, 5, 3280, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 253, 1416, 3280, 1440, 102, 31, 253, 6, 28, 506, 104, 1, 3, 169, 15121, 12348, 14, 4915, 1724, 1857, 1303, 1, 3, 7, 5, 3280, 12348, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 31, 253, 42, 1033, 12348, 14, 112, 7723, 17, 1904, 4915, 2308, 4, 3, 256, 2158, 3206, 1, 12348, 14, 92, 16, 834, 29, 2906, 3143, 14, 2535, 114, 272, 1107, 3, 12517, 1, 38229, 1, 3280, 12348, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 31, 253, 4, 7, 5, 131, 46, 272, 608, 3, 6188, 1, 12348, 14, 6, 4223, 2102, 763, 2, 5498, 250, 253, 17, 1022, 44, 1383, 11651, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 673, 491, 377, 8, 1082, 1728, 9, 3, 1680, 1, 12348, 14, 2491, 15, 178, 4, 1274, 143, 9, 7, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 12348, 14, 57]",1587.0,21131422,Epitope hierarchy spontaneous CD4+ responses LAGE-1,11,0.03728813559322034
Outcomes after resection of postchemotherapy residual neck mass in patients with germ cell tumors--an update.,Urology,Urology,2011-03-01,"To examine histologic findings and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent neck dissection for residual neck masses. From 1987 to 2008, 968 postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissections (RPLND) were performed at our institution. We identified 41 of these patients who underwent a postchemotherapy residual neck mass resection. Thirty-nine patients presented with primary testis, one with retroperitoneal, and one with mediastinal GCT. Teratoma was present in 54% of patients at diagnosis. During the neck dissection, 23 (56.1%) patients had teratoma, 14 (34.2%) had fibrosis, three (7.3%) had viable GCT, and one had benign lymph nodes. There was histologic discordance between the neck and the RPLND in 22.5% of patients and between the neck and other extraretroperitoneal resection sites in 26.5% of patients. At a median follow-up of 49.5 months from diagnosis, 16 patients had recurrence, and seven had died of testis cancer. No patient had recurrence in the neck. Five of seven patients with residual viable cancer at extraretroperitoneal resection sites died of disease compared with two of 23 with teratoma and none with fibrosis (P = .0005). Resection of residual postchemotherapy neck masses is indicated because of the high incidence of viable tumor or teratoma in the residual mass and the inability to accurately predict the histology of the neck masses.

Testicular microlithiasis: recent advances in understanding and management.,Nature reviews. Urology,Nat Rev Urol,2011-03-01,"Testicular microlithiasis is an infrequent but well recognized condition, which is usually incidentally identified on testicular ultrasound scan. Interest in testicular microlithiasis has increased over the past few years, owing to an observed association with testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) and intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type (ITGCNU). This association has added to evidence that testicular microlithiasis is a feature of the testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which is postulated to underpin disorders of male reproduction such as subfertility, testicular atrophy, cryptorchidism, TGCT and other abnormalities of sexual development. Although the genetic and environmental components of TDS remain unclear, studies of the molecular basis of TGCT support a genetic component for testicular microlithiasis and have identified multiple genes that are associated with TGCT.

Complications associated with chemotherapy in testicular cancer management.,Nature reviews. Urology,Nat Rev Urol,2011-03-15,"Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men aged 15-35 years. The introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has resulted in a cure rate of over 95% for men with testicular cancer, which has put increased emphasis on understanding the morbidity associated with chemotherapy. Hematological, gastrointestinal, gonadal, otological, renal, neurological, and pulmonary toxicities are the most common acute adverse effects. Although most patients recover, some of these effects can persist after the chemotherapy regimen has been completed and can become chronic problems. The late complications associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy include secondary malignancies, cardiovascular disease, avascular necrosis, and cognitive impairment. Late complications can have considerable effects on survival and quality of life, so close monitoring of patients is critical for the early diagnosis of late adverse effects and to limit associated damage. All patients should adopt a healthy lifestyle and follow age-appropriate cancer screening programs. Hormonal supplementation should be considered for those with a low testosterone level, in order to reduce the risk of sexual dysfunction and metabolic syndrome. Prompt diagnosis of avascular necrosis is essential, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any long-term testicular cancer survivor complaining of hip pain.

Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-04-12,"To investigate testicular doses contributed by kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kVCBCT) during image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer. An EGS4 Monte Carlo code was used to calculate three-dimensional dose distributions from kVCBCT on 3 prostate cancer patients. Absorbed doses to various organs were compared between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatments and kVCBCT scans. The impact of CBCT scanning mode, kilovoltage peak energy (kVp), and CBCT field span on dose deposition to testes and other organs was investigated. In comparison with one 10-MV IMRT treatment, a 125-kV half-fan CBCT scan delivered 3.4, 3.8, 4.1, and 5.7 cGy to the prostate, rectum, bladder, and femoral heads, respectively, accounting for 1.7%, 3.2%, 3.2%, and 8.4% of megavoltage photon dose contributions. However, the testes received 2.9 cGy from the same CBCT scan, a threefold increase as compared with 0.7 cGy received during IMRT. With the same kVp, full-fan mode deposited much less dose to organs than half-fan mode, ranging from 9% less for prostate to 69% less for testes, except for rectum, where full-fan mode delivered 34% more dose. As photon beam energy increased from 60 to 125 kV, kVCBCT-contributed doses increased exponentially for all organs, irrespective of scanning mode. Reducing CBCT field span from 30 to 10 cm in the superior-inferior direction cut testicular doses from 5.7 to 0.2 cGy in half-fan mode and from 1.5 to 0.1 cGy in full-fan mode. Compared with IMRT, kVCBCT-contributed doses to the prostate, rectum, bladder, and femoral heads are clinically insignificant, whereas dose to the testes is threefold more. Full-fan CBCT usually deposits much less dose to organs (except for rectum) than half-fan mode in prostate patients. Kilovoltage CBCT-contributed doses increase exponentially with photon beam energy. Reducing CBCT field significantly cuts doses to testes and other organs.",Journal Article,3206.0,15.0,investigate testicular doses contributed kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography kVCBCT image-guided radiotherapy IGRT prostate EGS4 Monte Carlo code calculate three-dimensional dose distributions kVCBCT 3 prostate patients Absorbed doses organs compared intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT treatments kVCBCT scans impact CBCT scanning mode kilovoltage peak energy kVp CBCT field span dose deposition testes organs investigated comparison 10-MV IMRT treatment 125-kV half-fan CBCT scan delivered 3.4 3.8 4.1 5.7 cGy prostate rectum bladder femoral heads respectively accounting 1.7 3.2 3.2 8.4 megavoltage photon dose contributions testes received 2.9 cGy CBCT scan threefold increase compared 0.7 cGy received IMRT kVp full-fan mode deposited dose organs half-fan mode ranging 9 prostate 69 testes rectum full-fan mode delivered 34 dose photon beam energy increased 60 125 kV kVCBCT-contributed doses increased exponentially organs irrespective scanning mode Reducing CBCT field span 30 10 cm superior-inferior direction cut testicular doses 5.7 0.2 cGy half-fan mode 1.5 0.1 cGy full-fan mode Compared IMRT kVCBCT-contributed doses prostate rectum bladder femoral heads clinically insignificant dose testes threefold Full-fan CBCT usually deposits dose organs rectum half-fan mode prostate patients Kilovoltage CBCT-contributed doses increase exponentially photon beam energy Reducing CBCT field significantly cuts doses testes organs,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 963, 415, 3447, 20, 16879, 6939, 1345, 1220, 872, 31794, 190, 1482, 1808, 310, 7901, 1, 12, 35, 60022, 7990, 7991, 5853, 10, 95, 6, 3232, 169, 2201, 61, 4477, 29, 31794, 23, 27, 12, 7, 5249, 415, 6, 747, 2285, 11, 72, 59, 837, 1757, 310, 964, 640, 2, 31794, 1441, 3, 345, 1, 5187, 3702, 4530, 16879, 2944, 2803, 21086, 2, 5187, 1067, 7165, 23, 61, 6686, 6, 13100, 2, 127, 2285, 10, 565, 4, 1155, 5, 104, 79, 3491, 964, 24, 8, 1731, 11007, 1303, 22665, 5187, 1657, 1623, 27, 39, 27, 66, 39, 14, 2, 33, 67, 3071, 6, 3, 3660, 2, 7649, 26969, 106, 3116, 9, 14, 67, 27, 18, 27, 18, 2, 66, 39, 1, 17688, 4216, 61, 5621, 137, 3, 13100, 103, 18, 83, 3071, 29, 3, 827, 5187, 1657, 8, 10182, 344, 22, 72, 5, 13, 67, 3071, 103, 190, 964, 5, 3, 827, 21086, 1647, 22665, 4530, 18379, 1802, 299, 61, 6, 2285, 76, 1303, 22665, 4530, 2223, 29, 83, 299, 9, 6, 790, 299, 9, 13100, 2187, 9, 3660, 1257, 1647, 22665, 4530, 1623, 562, 80, 61, 22, 4216, 1345, 2803, 101, 29, 335, 6, 1731, 11007, 31794, 3447, 415, 101, 16859, 9, 62, 2285, 3500, 1, 3702, 4530, 1818, 5187, 1067, 7165, 29, 201, 6, 79, 494, 4, 3, 1123, 1663, 4651, 3554, 415, 29, 33, 67, 6, 13, 18, 3071, 4, 1303, 22665, 4530, 2, 29, 14, 33, 6, 13, 14, 3071, 4, 1647, 22665, 4530, 72, 5, 964, 31794, 3447, 415, 6, 3, 3660, 2, 7649, 26969, 32, 505, 6761, 547, 61, 6, 3, 13100, 16, 10182, 80, 1647, 22665, 5187, 2082, 7626, 1802, 299, 61, 6, 2285, 2187, 9, 3660, 76, 1303, 22665, 4530, 4, 7, 16879, 5187, 3447, 415, 344, 16859, 5, 4216, 1345, 2803, 1818, 5187, 1067, 97, 28471, 415, 6, 13100, 2, 127, 2285]",1779.0,21489702,Testicular doses image-guided radiotherapy prostate,0,0.0
A second independent locus within DMRT1 is associated with testicular germ cell tumor susceptibility.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2011-05-06,"Susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has a significant heritable component, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified association with variants in several genes, including KITLG, SPRY4, BAK1, TERT, DMRT1 and ATF7IP. In our GWAS, we genotyped 349 TGCT cases and 919 controls and replicated top hits in an independent set of 439 cases and 960 controls in an attempt to find novel TGCT susceptibility loci. We identified a second marker (rs7040024) in the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) gene that is independent of the previously described risk allele (rs755383) at this locus. In combined analysis that mutually conditions on both DMRT1 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, TGCT cases had elevated odds of carriage of the rs7040024 major A allele [per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23, 1.78; P = 2.52 × 10(-5)] compared with controls, while the association with rs755383 persisted (per allele OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08, 1.47, P = 0.0036).

Intermediate-term oncological efficacy of laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for non-seminomatous germ cell testicular cancer.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2011-06-01,"To assess the therapeutic efficacy of laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (L-RPLND) for testicular cancer in patients with nodal disease managed without adjuvant chemotherapy. Consecutive patients undergoing RPLND were treated laparoscopically. Medical records for 15 patients with pathological stage I and II were reviewed. A modified template dissection was performed laparoscopically. When metastatic disease was noted on intraoperative frozen section, a bilateral template dissection was performed. All patients had predominantly embryonal carcinoma and/or lymphovascular invasion in their orchidectomy specimen. All patients had normal tumour markers after orchidectomy. Laparoscopic RPLND was performed without intraoperative complications. The mean operative time was 299 min and mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. After L-RPLND, two patients were pN1 and five patients were pN2. Of the patients with nodal disease, five (two pN1 and three pN2) were followed without chemotherapy for a mean of 30 months with no evidence of recurrence. Isolated pulmonary recurrence occurred in two patients with pathologic stage I disease, and another stage I patient had recurrence in the lung and retroperitoneum outside the dissection template. Laparoscopic RPLND appears to be safe while providing the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. Although the therapeutic benefit of L-RPLND needs to be confirmed in additional patients and with longer follow-up, our results suggest that L-RPLND provides both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits.",Journal Article,3156.0,4.0,assess therapeutic efficacy laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection L-RPLND testicular patients nodal disease managed adjuvant chemotherapy Consecutive patients undergoing RPLND treated laparoscopically Medical records 15 patients pathological stage II reviewed modified template dissection performed laparoscopically metastatic disease noted intraoperative frozen section bilateral template dissection performed patients predominantly embryonal carcinoma and/or lymphovascular invasion orchidectomy specimen patients normal tumour markers orchidectomy Laparoscopic RPLND performed intraoperative complications mean operative time 299 min mean length hospital stay 1.5 days L-RPLND patients pN1 patients pN2 patients nodal disease pN1 pN2 followed chemotherapy mean 30 months evidence recurrence Isolated pulmonary recurrence occurred patients pathologic stage disease stage patient recurrence lung retroperitoneum outside dissection template Laparoscopic RPLND appears safe providing benefits minimally invasive surgery therapeutic benefit L-RPLND needs confirmed additional patients longer follow-up suggest L-RPLND provides diagnostic therapeutic benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 423, 3, 189, 209, 1, 1964, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 805, 5022, 9, 12, 4, 7, 5, 779, 34, 2231, 187, 249, 56, 935, 7, 479, 5022, 11, 73, 11472, 484, 1064, 9, 167, 7, 5, 1301, 82, 70, 2, 215, 11, 446, 8, 1230, 5932, 1161, 10, 173, 11472, 198, 113, 34, 10, 1051, 23, 1720, 3015, 2917, 8, 1607, 5932, 1161, 10, 173, 62, 7, 42, 2117, 5239, 134, 2, 15, 2933, 578, 4, 136, 38022, 2360, 62, 7, 42, 295, 770, 525, 50, 38022, 1964, 5022, 10, 173, 187, 1720, 521, 3, 313, 1208, 98, 10, 8769, 1538, 2, 313, 1318, 1, 702, 2020, 10, 14, 33, 162, 50, 805, 5022, 100, 7, 11, 7945, 2, 365, 7, 11, 9491, 1, 3, 7, 5, 779, 34, 365, 100, 7945, 2, 169, 9491, 11, 370, 187, 56, 9, 8, 313, 1, 201, 53, 5, 77, 241, 1, 146, 1355, 1087, 146, 489, 4, 100, 7, 5, 510, 82, 70, 34, 2, 1809, 82, 70, 69, 42, 146, 4, 3, 2, 7765, 2513, 3, 1161, 5932, 1964, 5022, 1233, 6, 40, 1165, 369, 1736, 3, 1141, 1, 2144, 416, 152, 242, 3, 189, 247, 1, 805, 5022, 1891, 6, 40, 557, 4, 402, 7, 2, 5, 589, 166, 126, 114, 99, 309, 17, 805, 5022, 777, 110, 752, 2, 189, 1141]",1520.0,21631699,Intermediate-term oncological efficacy laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection non-seminomatous germ testicular,7,0.023728813559322035
Sequelae of treatment in long-term survivors of testis cancer.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2011-06-12,"Testicular cancer patients are often diagnosed at a young age, and because of the advances in the treatment of this disease, the vast majority have a normal life expectancy after therapy. Thus, recognition of the long-term sequelae of treatment (ie, surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) is particularly important in these patients. To review the adverse effects and the risk of secondary malignancy in long-term survivors of testicular cancer. We conducted a Medline search to identify original articles and reviews on the long-term effects of testicular cancer treatment. Although the search included articles from January 1948 to February 2011, the majority of the included articles were published in the last two decades. All studies examining the long-term sequelae of treatment in testicular cancer are retrospective in nature, with most classified as cohort, case-control, and/or epidemiologic studies. Given that no standardized method of reporting long-term complications exists, evidence synthesis is limited. Recent evidence suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, and mild reductions in renal function in survivors of testicular cancer.

Melanoma antigen family A identified by the bimodality index defines a subset of triple negative breast cancers as candidates for immune response augmentation.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2011-07-07,"Molecular markers displaying bimodal expression distribution can reveal distinct disease subsets and may serve as prognostic or predictive markers or represent therapeutic targets. Oestrogen (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors are strongly bimodally expressed genes in breast cancer. We applied a novel method to identify bimodally expressed genes in 394 triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). We identified 133 bimodally expressed probe sets (128 unique genes), 69 of these correlated to previously reported metagenes that define molecular subtypes within TNBC including basal-like, molecular-apocrine, claudin-low and immune cell rich subgroups but 64 probe sets showed no correlation with these features. The single most prominent functional group among these uncorrelated genes was the X chromosome derived Cancer/Testis Antigens (CT-X) including melanoma antigen family A (MAGE-A) and Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTAG). High expression of CT-X genes correlated with worse survival in multivariate analysis (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.27-3.20; P=0.003). The only other significant variable was lymph node status. The poor prognosis of patients with high MAGE-A expression was ameliorated by the concomitant high expression of immune cell metagenes (HR 1.87, 95% CI 0.96-3.64; P=0.060), whereas the same immune metagene had lesser prognostic value in TNBC with low MAGE-A expression. MAGE-A antigen defines a very aggressive subgroup of TNBC; particularly in the absence of immune infiltration in the tumour microenvironment. These observations suggest a therapeutic hypothesis; TNBC with MAGE-A expression may benefit the most from further augmentation of the immune response. Novel immune stimulatory drugs such as (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 CTLA-4) directed therapies provide a realistic opportunity to directly test this hypothesis in the clinic.",Journal Article,3120.0,28.0,Molecular markers displaying bimodal expression distribution reveal distinct disease subsets serve prognostic predictive markers represent therapeutic targets Oestrogen ER human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 receptors strongly bimodally expressed breast applied novel identify bimodally expressed 394 triple negative breast TNBC identified 133 bimodally expressed probe sets 128 unique 69 correlated previously reported metagenes define molecular subtypes TNBC including basal-like molecular-apocrine claudin-low immune rich subgroups 64 probe sets showed correlation features single prominent functional group uncorrelated X chromosome derived Cancer/Testis Antigens CT-X including melanoma antigen family MAGE-A Cancer/Testis Antigens CTAG High expression CT-X correlated worse survival multivariate HR 2.02 95 CI 1.27-3.20 P=0.003 significant variable lymph node status poor prognosis patients high MAGE-A expression ameliorated concomitant high expression immune metagenes HR 1.87 95 CI 0.96-3.64 P=0.060 immune metagene lesser prognostic value TNBC low MAGE-A expression MAGE-A antigen defines aggressive subgroup TNBC particularly absence immune infiltration tumour microenvironment observations suggest therapeutic hypothesis TNBC MAGE-A expression benefit augmentation immune response Novel immune stimulatory drugs anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 CTLA-4 directed therapies provide realistic opportunity directly test hypothesis clinic,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[219, 525, 6609, 18225, 55, 1395, 122, 2396, 834, 34, 1890, 2, 68, 1833, 22, 177, 15, 464, 525, 15, 1231, 189, 637, 7150, 516, 2, 171, 829, 129, 161, 153, 18, 354, 1186, 32, 1327, 39707, 570, 214, 4, 12, 21, 1498, 8, 229, 596, 6, 255, 39707, 570, 214, 4, 9273, 1500, 199, 163, 1403, 21, 108, 5026, 39707, 570, 2888, 2270, 3990, 991, 214, 790, 1, 46, 438, 6, 373, 210, 13157, 17, 1107, 219, 814, 262, 1403, 141, 2135, 733, 219, 13016, 9689, 154, 2, 250, 31, 3697, 1453, 84, 660, 2888, 2270, 224, 77, 816, 5, 46, 404, 3, 226, 96, 3689, 583, 87, 107, 46, 39629, 214, 10, 3, 1006, 1170, 526, 12, 7697, 1575, 425, 1006, 141, 448, 607, 8, 4871, 8, 2, 12, 7697, 1575, 60323, 64, 55, 1, 425, 1006, 214, 438, 5, 639, 25, 4, 331, 65, 168, 18, 588, 48, 58, 14, 428, 27, 179, 19, 13, 1421, 3, 158, 127, 93, 1347, 10, 263, 289, 156, 3, 334, 356, 1, 7, 5, 64, 4871, 8, 55, 10, 13841, 20, 3, 1781, 64, 55, 1, 250, 31, 13157, 168, 14, 912, 48, 58, 13, 921, 27, 660, 19, 13, 9972, 547, 3, 827, 250, 13663, 42, 5191, 177, 549, 4, 1403, 5, 154, 4871, 8, 55, 4871, 8, 448, 5849, 8, 923, 571, 1363, 1, 1403, 823, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 250, 2084, 4, 3, 770, 995, 46, 2172, 309, 8, 189, 1492, 1403, 5, 4871, 8, 55, 68, 247, 3, 96, 29, 195, 9047, 1, 3, 250, 51, 229, 250, 6708, 600, 225, 22, 312, 759, 102, 1448, 448, 39, 2127, 39, 1166, 235, 377, 8, 7661, 2666, 6, 1606, 412, 26, 1492, 4, 3, 1188]",1817.0,21741824,Melanoma antigen family identified bimodality index defines subset triple negative breast candidates immune response augmentation,1,0.003389830508474576
The histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat (SNDX-275) induces apoptosis in Hodgkin lymphoma cells and synergizes with Bcl-2 family inhibitors.,Experimental hematology,Exp. Hematol.,2011-07-20,"Based on promising in vitro and in vivo activity of several histone deacetylase inhibitors in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), we investigated SNDX-275, an oral class 1 isoform-selective histone deacetylase inhibitors in HL-derived cell lines. Proliferation and cell death were examined by MTS assay, Annexin V/propidium iodide, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Gene and protein expression were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis. A multiplex assay was used to determine cytokines and chemokines. SNDX-275 induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC(50) at the sub- and lower micromolar range at 72 hours. At the molecular level, SNDX-275 increased histone H3 acetylation, upregulated p21 expression, and activated the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by downregulating the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. SNDX-275 downregulated expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins without altering Mcl-1 or Bax levels. Combination studies demonstrated that two Bcl-2 inhibitors (ABT-737 and obatoclax) significantly enhanced the effect of SNDX-275. SNDX-275 modulated the level of several cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-12 p40-70, interferon-inducible protein-10, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), interleukin-13, interleukin-4, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and variably induced the cancer/testis antigen expression of MAGE-A4 and survivin in HL cell lines.

Cancer testis antigens in newly diagnosed and relapse multiple myeloma: prognostic markers and potential targets for immunotherapy.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2011-07-26,"In multiple myeloma, expression of cancer testis antigens may provide prognostic markers and potential targets for immunotherapy. Expression at relapse has not yet been evaluated for a large panel of cancer testis antigens which can be classified by varying expression in normal tissue: restricted to testis, expressed in testis and brain and not restricted but selectively expressed in testis. Evaluation of cancer testis antigen expression was made in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma cases (HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial; n = 320) and in relapse cases (APEX, SUMMIT, CREST trials; n = 264). Presence of expression using Affymetrix GeneChips was determined for 123 cancer testis antigens. Of these 87 had a frequency of more than 5% in the newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, and were evaluated in detail. Tissue restriction was known for 58 out of 87 cancer testis antigens. A significantly lower frequency of presence calls in the relapsed compared to newly diagnosed cases was found for 3 out of 13 testis restricted genes, 2 out of 7 testis/brain restricted genes, and 17 out of 38 testis selective genes. MAGEC1, MAGEB2 and SSX1 were the most frequent testis-restricted cancer testis antigens in both data sets. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that presence of MAGEA6 and CDCA1 were clearly associated with shorter progression free survival, and presence of MAGEA9 with shorter overall survival in the set of newly diagnosed cases. In the set of relapse cases, presence of CTAG2 was associated with shorter progression free survival and presence of SSX1 with shorter overall survival. Relapsed multiple myeloma reveals extensive cancer testis antigen expression. Cancer testis antigens are confirmed as useful prognostic markers in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and in relapsed multiple myeloma patients. The HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial is registered under Dutch trial register n. NTR-213. CREST, SUMMIT and APEX trials were registered under ns.

Progression-free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory germ cell tumors treated with single-agent chemotherapy: endpoints for clinical trial design.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-07-26,"Refractory germ cell tumor (GCT) patients have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The identification of novel active agents may be impaired by use of response as the primary endpoint in phase 2 trials. Improved endpoints could enhance the development of new effective agents. The characteristics and outcome of refractory GCT patients enrolled in 7 single-agent phase 2 trials conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed. The study agents were suramin, all-transretinoic acid, topotecan, pyrazoloacridine, temozolomide, ixabepilone, and sunitinib. The major endpoints evaluated were response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Ninety patients (87 male, 3 female) were treated. The primary tumor site was testis in 65 patients, mediastinum in 17 patients, retroperitoneum in 4 patients, and other in 4 patients. Eighty-six patients had nonseminoma, and 4 patients had pure seminoma. Best responses were 1 (1%) partial response (ixabepilone), 15 (17%) stable disease, and 74 (82%) progressive disease. Median PFS and OS were 1.0 month (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.3) and 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.5-6.4), respectively. Eighty-six of the 90 patients have died. The 12- and 16-week PFS rates were 9% (95% CI, 3-15%) and 6% (95% CI, 1%-11%), respectively. Patients with refractory GCT progressed rapidly to these single agents. PFS and OS may be useful endpoints for designing phase 2 trials testing novel agents in this population. Twelve-week PFS (with comparison to the 9% benchmark rate reported herein) is the recommended endpoint for phase 2 trial design and median OS (using 4.7 months as the predicted median for the control arm) is suggested for phase 3 trials.",Journal Article,3101.0,33.0,Refractory germ GCT patients poor prognosis limited treatment options identification novel active agents impaired use response primary endpoint phase 2 trials Improved endpoints enhance development new effective agents characteristics outcome refractory GCT patients enrolled 7 single-agent phase 2 trials conducted Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center 1990 2008 reviewed agents suramin all-transretinoic acid topotecan pyrazoloacridine temozolomide ixabepilone sunitinib major endpoints evaluated response progression-free survival PFS overall survival OS Ninety patients 87 male 3 female treated primary site testis 65 patients mediastinum 17 patients retroperitoneum 4 patients 4 patients Eighty-six patients nonseminoma 4 patients pure seminoma Best responses 1 1 partial response ixabepilone 15 17 stable disease 74 82 progressive disease Median PFS OS 1.0 month 95 confidence interval CI 0.8-1.3 4.7 months 95 CI 3.5-6.4 respectively Eighty-six 90 patients died 12- 16-week PFS rates 9 95 CI 3-15 6 95 CI 1 -11 respectively Patients refractory GCT progressed rapidly single agents PFS OS useful endpoints designing phase 2 trials testing novel agents population Twelve-week PFS comparison 9 benchmark rate reported recommended endpoint phase 2 trial design median OS 4.7 months predicted median control arm suggested phase 3 trials,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[430, 2280, 31, 30, 3856, 7, 47, 8, 334, 356, 2, 383, 24, 838, 3, 911, 1, 229, 544, 183, 68, 40, 2364, 20, 119, 1, 51, 22, 3, 86, 1138, 4, 124, 18, 143, 231, 1387, 359, 1304, 3, 193, 1, 217, 323, 183, 3, 374, 2, 228, 1, 430, 3856, 7, 346, 4, 67, 226, 420, 124, 18, 143, 426, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 29, 2289, 6, 1375, 11, 446, 3, 45, 183, 11, 12744, 62, 60404, 971, 2129, 18814, 1537, 3514, 2, 1086, 3, 458, 1387, 194, 11, 51, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 63, 25, 118, 2493, 7, 912, 1045, 27, 1061, 11, 73, 3, 86, 30, 606, 10, 4, 556, 7, 7156, 4, 269, 7, 7765, 4, 39, 7, 2, 127, 4, 39, 7, 2207, 437, 7, 42, 13643, 2, 39, 7, 42, 3092, 6930, 824, 253, 11, 14, 14, 450, 51, 3514, 167, 269, 585, 34, 2, 794, 878, 1014, 34, 52, 300, 2, 118, 11, 14, 13, 811, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 66, 14, 27, 2, 39, 67, 53, 48, 58, 27, 33, 49, 39, 106, 2207, 437, 1, 3, 424, 7, 47, 1016, 3, 133, 2, 245, 647, 300, 151, 11, 83, 48, 58, 27, 167, 2, 49, 48, 58, 14, 175, 106, 7, 5, 430, 3856, 1839, 1755, 6, 46, 226, 183, 300, 2, 118, 68, 40, 999, 1387, 9, 5048, 124, 18, 143, 471, 229, 183, 4, 26, 266, 2544, 647, 300, 5, 1155, 6, 3, 83, 7330, 116, 210, 1986, 16, 3, 793, 1138, 9, 124, 18, 160, 771, 2, 52, 118, 75, 39, 67, 53, 22, 3, 783, 52, 9, 3, 182, 475, 16, 1148, 9, 124, 27, 143]",1662.0,21792865,Progression-free overall survival patients relapsed/refractory germ treated single-agent chemotherapy endpoints clinical trial design,2,0.006779661016949152
Cancer-testis antigen expression and its epigenetic modulation in acute myeloid leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2011-09-02,"Cancer-testis antigens (CTA) represent attractive targets for tumor immunotherapy. However, a broad picture of CTA expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is missing. CTA expression was analyzed in normal bone marrow (BM) as well as in AML cell lines before and after treatment with demethylating agents and/or histone acetylase inhibitors. Presence of selected CTA with a strictly tumor-restricted expression was then determined in samples of patients with AML before and after demethylating therapy. Screening AML cell lines for the expression of 20 CTA, we identified six genes (MAGE-A3, PRAME, ROPN1, SCP-1, SLLP1, and SPO11) with an AML-restricted expression. Analyzing the expression of these CTA in blast-containing samples from AML patients (N = 64), we found all samples to be negative for MAGE-A3 and SPO11 while a minority of patients expressed ROPN1 (1.6%), SCP-1 (3.1%), or SLLP1 (9.4%). The only CTA expressed in substantial proportion of patients (53.1%) was PRAME. Following demethylating treatment with 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, we observed an increased or de novo expression of CTA, in particular of SSX-2, in AML cell lines. In AML patients, we detected increased expression of PRAME and induction of SSX-2 after demethylating therapy with 5-azacytidine. With the exception of PRAME, CTA are mostly absent from AML blasts. However, demethylating treatment induces strong expression of CTA, particularly of SSX-2, in vitro and in vivo.

Improving T-cell therapy for relapsed EBV-negative Hodgkin lymphoma by targeting upregulated MAGE-A4.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-09-09,"Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) relapsing after hematopoietic stem cell transplant have limited options for long-term cure. We have shown that infused cytotoxic T cells (CTL) targeting Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-derived proteins induced complete remissions in EBV(+) HL patients. A limitation of this approach is that up to 70% of relapsed HL tumors are EBV-negative. For these patients, an alternative is to target the cancer/testis antigen MAGE-A4 present in EBV antigen-negative HL tumors. Furthermore, epigenetic modification by clinically available demethylating agents can enhance MAGE-A4 expression in previously MAGE-negative tumors. We explored the feasibility of combining adoptive T cell therapy with epigenetic modification of tumor antigen expression. We further characterized MAGE-A4-specific T-cell phenotype and function, and examined the effects of the epigenetic modifying drug decitabine on these T cells. Cytotoxic T cells were generated specifically recognizing MAGE-A4 expressed by autologous HL targets and tumor cell lines. Decitabine-previously shown to increase tumor antigen expression in HL-did not compromise MAGE-A4-specific T-cell phenotype and function. In patients treated with decitabine, expanded MAGE-A4-specific T cells had a broader antitumor T cell repertoire, consistent with increased antigen stimulation in vivo.

Cancer/Testis Antigens as potential predictors of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.,Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,2011-09-14,"The Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTAs) are an important group of proteins that are typically restricted to the testis in the normal adult but are aberrantly expressed in several types of cancers. As a result of their restricted expression patterns, the CTAs could serve as unique biomarkers for cancer diagnosis/prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify promising CTAs that are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP). The expression of 5 CTAs was measured by quantitative multiplex real-time PCR using prostate tissue samples obtained from 72 patients with apparently clinically localized PCa with a median of two years follow-up (range, 1 to 14 years). The expression of CTAs namely, CEP55, NUF2, PBK and TTK were significantly higher while PAGE4 was significantly lower in patients with recurrent disease. All CTAs with the exception of TTK were significantly correlated with the prostatectomy Gleason score, but none were correlated with age, stage, or preoperative PSA levels. In univariate proportional hazards models, CEP55 (HR = 3.59, 95% CI: 1.50-8.60), p = 0.004; NUF2 (HR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.11-4.67), p = 0.024; and PAGE4 (HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.93), p = 0.031 were significantly associated with the risk of PCa recurrence. However, the results were no longer significant after adjustment for prostatectomy Gleason score.

Integrated NY-ESO-1 antibody and CD8+ T-cell responses correlate with clinical benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2011-09-20,"Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), has been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. It also enhances immunity to NY-ESO-1, a cancer/testis antigen expressed in a subset of patients with melanoma. To characterize the association between immune response and clinical outcome, we first analyzed NY-ESO-1 serum antibody by ELISA in 144 ipilimumab-treated patients with melanoma and found 22 of 140 (16%) seropositive at baseline and 31 of 144 (22%) seropositive following treatment. These NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients had a greater likelihood of experiencing clinical benefit 24 wk after ipilimumab treatment than NY-ESO-1-seronegative patients (P = 0.02, relative risk = 1.8, two-tailed Fisher test). To understand why some patients with NY-ESO-1 antibody failed to experience clinical benefit, we analyzed NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses by intracellular multicytokine staining in 20 NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients and found a surprising dissociation between NY-ESO-1 antibody and CD8 responses in some patients. NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients with associated CD8(+) T cells experienced more frequent clinical benefit (10 of 13; 77%) than those with undetectable CD8(+) T-cell response (one of seven; 14%; P = 0.02; relative risk = 5.4, two-tailed Fisher test), as well as a significant survival advantage (P = 0.01; hazard ratio = 0.2, time-dependent Cox model). Together, our data suggest that integrated NY-ESO-1 immune responses may have predictive value for ipilimumab treatment and argue for prospective studies in patients with established NY-ESO-1 immunity. The current findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical use of modulators of immunosuppression with concurrent approaches to favor tumor antigen-specific immune responses, such as vaccines or adoptive transfer, in patients with cancer.",Journal Article,3045.0,230.0,Ipilimumab monoclonal antibody cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4 CTLA-4 shown improve survival patients advanced metastatic melanoma enhances immunity NY-ESO-1 cancer/testis antigen expressed subset patients melanoma characterize association immune response clinical outcome NY-ESO-1 serum antibody ELISA 144 ipilimumab-treated patients melanoma 22 140 16 seropositive baseline 31 144 22 seropositive following treatment NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients greater likelihood experiencing clinical benefit 24 wk ipilimumab treatment NY-ESO-1-seronegative patients P 0.02 relative risk 1.8 two-tailed Fisher test understand patients NY-ESO-1 antibody failed experience clinical benefit NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 CD8 T-cell responses intracellular multicytokine staining 20 NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients surprising dissociation NY-ESO-1 antibody CD8 responses patients NY-ESO-1-seropositive patients associated CD8 experienced frequent clinical benefit 10 13 77 undetectable CD8 T-cell response seven 14 P 0.02 relative risk 5.4 two-tailed Fisher test significant survival advantage P 0.01 hazard ratio 0.2 time-dependent Cox model suggest integrated NY-ESO-1 immune responses predictive value ipilimumab treatment argue prospective studies patients established NY-ESO-1 immunity current findings provide strong rationale clinical use modulators immunosuppression concurrent approaches favor antigen-specific immune responses vaccines adoptive transfer patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1306, 8, 848, 548, 480, 759, 102, 1448, 448, 39, 2127, 39, 71, 85, 443, 6, 401, 25, 4, 7, 5, 131, 113, 192, 120, 2519, 1604, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 8, 12, 7697, 448, 570, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 6, 1507, 3, 248, 59, 250, 51, 2, 38, 228, 21, 157, 311, 2906, 3143, 14, 524, 548, 20, 3664, 4, 4415, 1306, 73, 7, 5, 2, 204, 350, 1, 3304, 245, 9909, 28, 330, 2, 456, 1, 4415, 350, 9909, 366, 24, 46, 2906, 3143, 14, 9909, 7, 42, 8, 378, 1420, 1, 2985, 38, 247, 259, 3293, 50, 1306, 24, 76, 2906, 3143, 14, 14924, 7, 19, 13, 588, 580, 43, 14, 66, 100, 12119, 3135, 412, 6, 1640, 5283, 476, 7, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 548, 1551, 6, 730, 38, 247, 21, 311, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 1440, 2, 968, 102, 31, 253, 20, 2087, 60568, 1029, 4, 179, 2906, 3143, 14, 9909, 7, 2, 204, 8, 14157, 10443, 59, 2906, 3143, 14, 548, 2, 968, 253, 4, 476, 7, 2906, 3143, 14, 9909, 7, 5, 41, 968, 102, 37, 592, 80, 908, 38, 247, 79, 1, 233, 849, 76, 135, 5, 3920, 968, 102, 31, 51, 104, 1, 648, 213, 19, 13, 588, 580, 43, 33, 39, 100, 12119, 3135, 412, 22, 149, 22, 8, 93, 25, 1874, 19, 13, 355, 360, 197, 13, 18, 98, 470, 418, 202, 1162, 114, 74, 309, 17, 2102, 2906, 3143, 14, 250, 253, 68, 47, 464, 549, 9, 1306, 24, 2, 7004, 9, 482, 94, 4, 7, 5, 635, 2906, 3143, 14, 1604, 3, 291, 272, 377, 8, 1082, 1728, 9, 3, 38, 119, 1, 5014, 1, 3646, 5, 750, 611, 6, 4283, 30, 448, 112, 250, 253, 225, 22, 1842, 15, 3159, 2602, 4, 7, 5, 12]",1819.0,21933959,Integrated NY-ESO-1 antibody CD8+ T-cell responses correlate clinical benefit advanced melanoma patients treated ipilimumab,1,0.003389830508474576

A panel was convened of experts from 5 countries. A literature search in MEDLINE was used to identify evidence from relevant studies on the outcome and toxicity of observational, surgical, and chemotherapeutic approaches for low-stage nonseminomatous germ cell tumors to form the basis of the panel's recommendations. The panel has recommended the treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors in centers with medical, surgical, and diagnostic expertise in testicular cancer. The cancer-specific survival rate for CS I and CS IIA-IIB should approach 100% and 95%-100%, respectively. Patients with CS I should be made aware of all treatments (ie, surveillance, primary chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) and the potential side effects. For patients with CS I at low risk of occult metastasis, surveillance is preferred. For patients at high risk of occult metastasis, all 3 options can be considered. For immediate treatment, the choice between primary chemotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be determined by patient preference and the specific expertise of the treating institution. Patients with increasing postorchiectomy serum α-fetoprotein or human choriogonadotropin levels (CS IS and CS IIA-IIB) should receive induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection can be considered for patients with CS IIA-IIB with normal postorchiectomy α-fetoprotein and human choriogonadotropin levels. Surveillance can be considered for patients with equivocal computed tomography retroperitoneal findings who are otherwise at low risk of metastatic disease. These clinical practice guidelines are designed to improve clinical practice from the available evidence and the expert opinion of the panel. As such, deviation from these recommendations should be based on sound clinical judgment, considering the unique situation of the patient and the expertise of the treating physician and institution.",Consensus Development Conference,3034.0,12.0,advise urologists clinicians appropriate management low-stage clinical Stage CS IIA IIB nonseminomatous germ testis panel convened experts 5 countries literature search MEDLINE identify evidence relevant studies outcome toxicity observational surgical chemotherapeutic approaches low-stage nonseminomatous germ form basis panel 's recommendations panel recommended treatment nonseminomatous germ centers medical surgical diagnostic expertise testicular cancer-specific survival rate CS CS IIA-IIB approach 100 95 -100 respectively Patients CS aware treatments surveillance primary chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection potential effects patients CS low risk occult metastasis surveillance preferred patients high risk occult metastasis 3 options considered immediate treatment choice primary chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection determined patient preference specific expertise treating institution Patients increasing postorchiectomy serum α-fetoprotein human choriogonadotropin levels CS CS IIA-IIB receive induction chemotherapy Induction chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection considered patients CS IIA-IIB normal postorchiectomy α-fetoprotein human choriogonadotropin levels Surveillance considered patients equivocal computed tomography retroperitoneal findings low risk metastatic disease clinical practice guidelines designed improve clinical practice available evidence expert opinion panel deviation recommendations based sound clinical judgment considering unique situation patient expertise treating physician institution,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 12636, 5751, 2, 127, 1490, 23, 3, 870, 284, 1, 154, 82, 38, 82, 2188, 70, 16, 4088, 2, 3884, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 1, 3, 8, 993, 10, 4440, 1, 3186, 29, 33, 2115, 8, 789, 1901, 4, 3388, 10, 95, 6, 255, 241, 29, 867, 94, 23, 3, 228, 2, 155, 1, 2495, 221, 2, 1573, 611, 9, 154, 82, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 6, 1297, 3, 877, 1, 3, 993, 292, 883, 3, 993, 71, 793, 3, 24, 1, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 4, 1168, 5, 484, 221, 2, 752, 4935, 4, 12, 3, 12, 112, 25, 116, 9, 2188, 70, 2, 2188, 4088, 3884, 257, 353, 394, 2, 48, 394, 106, 7, 5, 2188, 70, 257, 40, 1229, 4749, 1, 62, 640, 2523, 617, 86, 56, 2, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 2, 3, 174, 1152, 176, 9, 7, 5, 2188, 70, 28, 154, 43, 1, 2879, 278, 617, 16, 2514, 9, 7, 28, 64, 43, 1, 2879, 278, 62, 27, 838, 122, 40, 515, 9, 2181, 24, 3, 1866, 59, 86, 56, 2, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 257, 40, 509, 20, 69, 3863, 2, 3, 112, 4935, 1, 3, 1367, 731, 7, 5, 602, 21326, 524, 2014, 6607, 15, 171, 46819, 148, 2188, 16, 2, 2188, 4088, 3884, 257, 560, 504, 56, 504, 56, 15, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 122, 40, 515, 9, 7, 5, 2188, 4088, 3884, 5, 295, 21326, 2014, 6607, 2, 171, 46819, 148, 617, 122, 40, 515, 9, 7, 5, 5068, 1220, 872, 2591, 272, 54, 32, 2632, 28, 154, 43, 1, 113, 34, 46, 38, 758, 677, 32, 1114, 6, 401, 38, 758, 29, 3, 390, 241, 2, 3, 2005, 3564, 1, 3, 993, 22, 225, 3348, 29, 46, 883, 257, 40, 90, 23, 11475, 38, 8671, 3075, 3, 991, 7747, 1, 3, 69, 2, 3, 4935, 1, 3, 1367, 1473, 2, 731]",2091.0,21986224,Management low-stage nonseminomatous germ testis SIU/ICUD Consensus Meeting Germ GCT Shanghai 2009,0,0.0
Immunity to the melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) in patients with malignant melanoma.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2011-10-28,"Therapeutic targeting of melanoma antigens frequently focuses on the melanocyte differentiation or cancer-testis families. Antigen-loss variants can often result, as these antigens are not critical for tumor cell survival. Exploration of functionally relevant targets has been limited. The melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to disease progression and treatment resistance. Improved understanding of the significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I-IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4(+) and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.",Journal Article,3007.0,17.0,Therapeutic targeting melanoma antigens frequently focuses melanocyte differentiation cancer-testis families Antigen-loss antigens critical survival Exploration functionally relevant targets limited melanoma inhibitor apoptosis ML-IAP livin overexpressed melanoma contributing disease progression treatment resistance Improved understanding significance ML-IAP immune responses patients possible therapeutic applications ML-IAP frequently expressed melanoma metastases immunohistochemistry assess spontaneous immunity ML-IAP overlapping peptide library representing full-length utilized screen cellular responses stage I-IV patients healthy controls ELISPOT broad array CD4 CD8 cellular responses ML-IAP observed novel class class II epitopes identified Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes frequency reactivity generation specific CD4 cytotoxic revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness melanoma lines killing addition recombinant ML-IAP ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses subset patients melanoma patients received CTLA-4 blockade ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses ML-IAP function treatment associated beneficial clinical outcomes High frequency immune responses melanoma patients associations favorable treatment outcomes essential role melanoma pathogenesis support development ML-IAP disease marker therapeutic target,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[189, 529, 1, 1575, 746, 3026, 23, 3, 8564, 910, 15, 12, 7697, 1954, 448, 407, 839, 122, 629, 757, 22, 46, 1575, 32, 44, 740, 9, 30, 31, 25, 3370, 1, 3772, 867, 637, 71, 85, 383, 3, 230, 1, 351, 178, 542, 9262, 46850, 16, 1711, 4, 3156, 6, 34, 91, 2, 24, 251, 231, 612, 1, 3, 724, 1, 542, 9262, 250, 253, 4, 7, 71, 899, 189, 2911, 21, 204, 542, 9262, 746, 570, 4, 196, 20, 888, 6, 423, 3280, 1604, 6, 542, 9262, 35, 4551, 1389, 4157, 2861, 1647, 1318, 178, 10, 2080, 6, 2413, 763, 253, 4, 82, 70, 478, 7, 2, 1331, 535, 20, 7662, 8, 2094, 1926, 1, 1440, 2, 968, 763, 253, 480, 542, 9262, 10, 164, 5, 229, 1040, 70, 2, 1040, 215, 4915, 108, 112, 1160, 8, 8529, 4915, 11, 311, 195, 9, 675, 1, 4601, 3, 914, 1, 112, 1440, 2, 759, 102, 37, 553, 1157, 583, 6188, 141, 1675, 3642, 6, 31, 285, 2, 30, 31, 3003, 4, 352, 2835, 542, 9262, 178, 95, 4, 35, 3664, 264, 64, 8444, 548, 253, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 392, 7, 54, 103, 2127, 39, 1189, 5, 1306, 276, 4277, 5498, 250, 253, 6, 542, 9262, 22, 8, 343, 1, 24, 92, 10, 41, 5, 2524, 38, 123, 64, 675, 250, 253, 4, 7, 685, 5, 913, 24, 123, 2, 211, 1452, 200, 4, 1384, 538, 3, 193, 1, 542, 9262, 22, 8, 34, 952, 2, 189, 283]",1696.0,22033581,Immunity melanoma inhibitor apoptosis ML-IAP livin patients malignant melanoma,1,0.003389830508474576
Targeting MAGE-C1/CT7 expression increases cell sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in multiple myeloma cell lines.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-11-16,"The MAGE-C1/CT7 encodes a cancer/testis antigen (CTA), is located on the chromosomal region Xq26-27 and is highly polymorphic in humans. MAGE-C1/CT7 is frequently expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) that may be a potential target for immunotherapy in this still incurable disease. MAGEC1/CT7 expression is restricted to malignant plasma cells and it has been suggested that MAGE-C1/CT7 might play a pathogenic role in MM; however, the exact function this protein in the pathophysiology of MM is not yet understood. Our objectives were (1) to clarify the role of MAGE-C1/CT7 in the control of cellular proliferation and cell cycle in myeloma and (2) to evaluate the impact of silencing MAGE-C1/CT7 on myeloma cells treated with bortezomib. Myeloma cell line SKO-007 was transduced for stable expression of shRNA-MAGE-C1/CT7. Downregulation of MAGE-C1/CT7 was confirmed by real time quantitative PCR and western blot. Functional assays included cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis. Western blot showed a 70-80% decrease in MAGE-C1/CT7 protein expression in inhibited cells (shRNA-MAGE-C1/CT7) when compared with controls. Functional assays did not indicate a difference in cell proliferation and DNA synthesis when inhibited cells were compared with controls. However, we found a decreased percentage of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle among inhibited cells, but not in the controls (p<0.05). When myeloma cells were treated with bortezomib, we observed a 48% reduction of cells in the G2/M phase among inhibited cells while controls showed 13% (empty vector) and 9% (ineffective shRNA) reduction, respectively (p<0.01). Furthermore, inhibited cells treated with bortezomib showed an increased percentage of apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI-) in comparison with bortezomib-treated controls (p<0.001). We found that MAGE-C1/CT7 protects SKO-007 cells against bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we could speculate that MAGE-C1/CT7 gene therapy could be a strategy for future therapies in MM, in particular in combination with proteasome inhibitors.",Journal Article,2988.0,15.0,MAGE-C1/CT7 encodes cancer/testis antigen CTA located chromosomal region Xq26-27 highly polymorphic humans MAGE-C1/CT7 frequently expressed multiple myeloma MM potential target immunotherapy incurable disease MAGEC1/CT7 expression restricted malignant plasma suggested MAGE-C1/CT7 play pathogenic role MM exact function pathophysiology MM understood objectives 1 clarify role MAGE-C1/CT7 control cellular proliferation cycle myeloma 2 evaluate impact silencing MAGE-C1/CT7 myeloma treated bortezomib Myeloma line SKO-007 transduced stable expression shRNA-MAGE-C1/CT7 Downregulation MAGE-C1/CT7 confirmed real time quantitative PCR western blot Functional included proliferation invasion cycle apoptosis Western blot showed 70-80 decrease MAGE-C1/CT7 expression inhibited shRNA-MAGE-C1/CT7 compared controls Functional indicate difference proliferation DNA synthesis inhibited compared controls decreased percentage G2/M phase cycle inhibited controls p 0.05 myeloma treated bortezomib observed 48 reduction G2/M phase inhibited controls showed 13 vector 9 ineffective shRNA reduction respectively p 0.01 Furthermore inhibited treated bortezomib showed increased percentage apoptotic Annexin V+/PI- comparison bortezomib-treated controls p 0.001 MAGE-C1/CT7 protects SKO-007 bortezomib-induced apoptosis speculate MAGE-C1/CT7 therapy strategy future therapies MM particular combination proteasome inhibitors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4871, 6801, 10331, 4322, 8, 12, 7697, 448, 8583, 16, 2308, 23, 3, 1860, 1053, 60813, 428, 2, 16, 561, 7087, 4, 3218, 4871, 6801, 10331, 16, 746, 570, 4, 232, 321, 17, 68, 40, 8, 174, 283, 9, 726, 4, 26, 1234, 2641, 34, 28580, 10331, 55, 16, 2016, 6, 393, 554, 37, 2, 192, 71, 85, 1148, 17, 4871, 6801, 10331, 822, 1343, 8, 2806, 200, 4, 321, 137, 3, 2472, 343, 26, 178, 4, 3, 4320, 1, 321, 16, 44, 1145, 1784, 114, 2409, 11, 14, 6, 3968, 3, 200, 1, 4871, 6801, 10331, 4, 3, 182, 1, 763, 457, 2, 31, 417, 4, 2, 18, 6, 376, 3, 345, 1, 2077, 4871, 6801, 10331, 23, 37, 73, 5, 819, 31, 328, 46899, 1999, 10, 5042, 9, 585, 55, 1, 3976, 4871, 6801, 10331, 2475, 1, 4871, 6801, 10331, 10, 557, 20, 1589, 98, 1156, 604, 2, 1521, 2639, 583, 1013, 159, 31, 457, 31, 578, 31, 417, 65, 2, 351, 1521, 2639, 224, 8, 431, 493, 775, 4, 4871, 6801, 10331, 178, 55, 4, 879, 37, 3976, 4871, 6801, 10331, 198, 72, 5, 535, 583, 1013, 205, 44, 1008, 8, 523, 4, 31, 457, 2, 261, 2525, 198, 879, 37, 11, 72, 5, 535, 137, 21, 204, 8, 340, 1150, 1, 37, 4, 3, 3774, 188, 124, 1, 3, 31, 417, 107, 879, 37, 84, 44, 4, 3, 535, 19, 13, 474, 198, 37, 11, 73, 5, 819, 21, 164, 8, 576, 628, 1, 37, 4, 3, 3774, 188, 124, 107, 879, 37, 369, 535, 224, 233, 9436, 3374, 2, 83, 3957, 3976, 628, 106, 19, 13, 355, 798, 879, 37, 73, 5, 819, 224, 35, 101, 1150, 1, 1631, 37, 4850, 603, 2928, 4, 1155, 5, 819, 73, 535, 19, 13, 144, 21, 204, 17, 4871, 6801, 10331, 8170, 46899, 1999, 37, 480, 819, 277, 351, 673, 21, 359, 11778, 17, 4871, 6801, 10331, 145, 36, 359, 40, 8, 692, 9, 508, 235, 4, 321, 4, 1454, 4, 150, 5, 1694, 222]",1998.0,22110734,Targeting MAGE-C1/CT7 expression increases sensitivity proteasome inhibitor bortezomib multiple myeloma lines,27,0.09152542372881356
Congenital anomalies in the children of cancer survivors: a report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-12,"Children with cancer receive mutagenic treatments, which raises concern about the potential transmissibility of germline damage to their offspring. This question has been inadequately studied to date because of a lack of detailed individual treatment exposure assessment such as gonadal radiation doses. Within the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis of validated cases of congenital anomalies among 4,699 children of 1,128 male and 1,627 female childhood cancer survivors. We quantified chemotherapy with alkylating agents and radiotherapy doses to the testes and ovaries and related these exposures to risk of congenital anomalies using logistic regression. One hundred twenty-nine children had at least one anomaly (prevalence = 2.7%). For children whose mothers were exposed to radiation or alkylating agents versus neither, the prevalence of anomalies was 3.0% versus 3.5% (P = .51); corresponding figures were 1.9% versus 1.7% (P = .79) for the children of male survivors. Neither ovarian radiation dose (mean, 1.19 Gy; odds ratio [OR] = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.75 for 2.50+ Gy) nor testicular radiation dose (mean, 0.48 Gy; OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.36 to 2.83 for 0.50+ Gy) was related to risk of congenital anomalies.

Abiraterone acetate: oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Drug design, development and therapy",Drug Des Devel Ther,2012-01-16,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the US and Europe. The treatment of advanced-stage prostate cancer has been androgen deprivation. Medical castration leads to decreased production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone by the testes, but adrenal glands and even prostate cancer tissue continue to produce androgens, which eventually leads to continued prostate cancer growth despite castrate level of androgens. This stage is known as castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which continues to be a challenge to treat. Addition of androgen antagonists to hormonal deprivation has been successful in lowering the prostate-specific antigen levels further, but has not actually translated into life-prolonging options. The results of several contemporary studies have continued to demonstrate activation of the androgen receptor as being the key factor in the continued growth of prostate cancer. Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.",Journal Article,2927.0,42.0,Prostate second leading cause death men Europe treatment advanced-stage prostate androgen deprivation Medical castration leads decreased production testosterone dihydrotestosterone testes adrenal glands prostate tissue continue produce androgens eventually leads continued prostate growth despite castrate level androgens stage known castrate-resistant prostate CRPC continues challenge treat Addition androgen antagonists hormonal deprivation successful lowering prostate-specific antigen levels actually translated life-prolonging options contemporary studies continued demonstrate activation androgen receptor key factor continued growth prostate Blockade androgen production nongonadal sources led clinical benefit setting agent abiraterone acetate significantly reduces androgen production blocking enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase CYP17 provided physicians treatment option patients CRPC landscape prostate treatment changed approval cabazitaxel sipuleucel-T abiraterone provide overview abiraterone acetate mechanism action potential place therapy CRPC,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 16, 3, 419, 1049, 708, 1, 12, 273, 4, 325, 4, 3, 843, 2, 3934, 3, 24, 1, 131, 82, 12, 71, 85, 687, 1868, 484, 1517, 1940, 6, 340, 1529, 1, 2660, 2, 7529, 20, 3, 13100, 84, 2987, 3966, 2, 871, 12, 246, 1906, 6, 2410, 5488, 92, 3124, 1940, 6, 1351, 12, 129, 550, 4435, 301, 1, 5488, 26, 82, 16, 440, 22, 4435, 436, 12, 1752, 92, 2274, 6, 40, 8, 1745, 6, 943, 352, 1, 687, 4444, 6, 1761, 1868, 71, 85, 1401, 4, 8326, 3, 1364, 112, 448, 148, 195, 84, 71, 44, 6742, 5136, 237, 358, 5559, 838, 3, 99, 1, 392, 2667, 94, 47, 1351, 6, 608, 363, 1, 3, 687, 153, 22, 486, 3, 825, 161, 4, 3, 1351, 129, 1, 12, 1189, 1, 687, 1529, 20, 38753, 3375, 71, 836, 6, 38, 247, 4, 26, 546, 104, 225, 420, 16, 2260, 3424, 92, 97, 2389, 687, 1529, 20, 2521, 3, 1644, 4155, 6965, 269, 950, 9136, 9997, 26, 71, 1052, 1261, 5, 1809, 24, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 1752, 3, 2801, 9, 12, 24, 71, 2368, 5, 3, 1814, 1, 6082, 5188, 102, 2, 2260, 467, 21, 377, 35, 2901, 1, 2260, 3424, 211, 670, 1, 1578, 2, 211, 174, 3536, 9, 36, 4, 1752]",1428.0,22291466,Abiraterone acetate oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor treatment castration-resistant prostate,5,0.01694915254237288
Liver resection for liver metastases from nondigestive endocrine cancer: extrahepatic disease burden defines outcome.,Surgery,Surgery,2012-02-04,"For patients with hepatic nondigestive endocrine metastases (HNEM), the role of liver resection is not well-defined. We reviewed outcomes for patients who underwent liver resection for HNEM at 2 centers to identify predictors of survival. From 1991 to 2010, 51 patients underwent liver resection for HNEM. Primary tumor types were adrenal gland (n = 26), thyroid (n = 11), testicular germ cell (n = 9), and ovarian granulosa cell (n = 5). 28 patients (55%) had synchronous or early (diagnosed within 12 months after primary tumor resection) liver metastases. At liver resection, 26 patients (51%) had extrahepatic metastases, and 7 (14%) had ≥2 sites of extrahepatic metastases. 32 patients (63%) had major liver resection and 19 (37%) had a simultaneous extrahepatic procedure. 90-day postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 27% and 2%, respectively. After median follow-up of 20 months (range, 1-144), the 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 58% and 37%, respectively. Survival was not affected by primary tumor type. In multivariate analysis, ≥2 sites of extrahepatic metastases (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-19.50; P = .028) and interval of ≤12 months between primary tumor resection and diagnosis of liver metastases (HR = 5.33; 95% CI = 1.11-25.71; P = .037) were associated with worse overall survival after liver resection.

Rapid-onset hypogonadism secondary to crizotinib use in men with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-04-04,"The objective of this study was to document the differences in testosterone (T) levels between crizotinib-treated and noncrizotinib-treated patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Testosterone levels were measured in 19 men with metastatic NSCLC who received crizotinib and in 19 men with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib. Clinical characteristics of the patients were compared, and additional hormone assays were performed as appropriate. Two patients who began crizotinib and 4 patients who had dose interruptions or who stopped crizotinib therapy had serial hormone measurements, permitting the documentation of dynamic hormone changes on and off crizotinib treatment. Total T levels were low (<241 ng/dL) in 19 of 19 (100%) crizotinib-treated men and in 6 of 19 men (32%) with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib (mean T levels, 131 ng/dL and 311 ng/dL, respectively; P = .0002). Only 1 in 5 patients who had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements and had not yet received crizotinib had low T. The initiation of crizotinib in 2 patients who had previously normal T levels was associated with a rapid decreases in T and in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels within 14 to 21 days.

Hypogonadism and infertility in testicular cancer survivors.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2012-04-01,"Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men in their 20s and 30s, and has been considered a model of a curable neoplasm. The longer life expectancy of testicular cancer survivors makes minimizing the long-term health issues related to hypogonadism particularly important, and because testicular cancer affects men mostly in their reproductive years, infertility can also be a major concern. Hypogonadism, infertility, and testicular cancer have been associated with one another. These associations suggest the existence of common etiologic factors, including improper testicular development during fetal life. The effect of cancer treatment on testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and on fertility and overall paternity rates among testicular cancer survivors, are potentially significant issues.

Steroid biosynthesis and prostate cancer.,Steroids,Steroids,2012-04-05,"The pathways of androgen biosynthesis in human beings have been studied for decades, and the major pathways and enzymes responsible for testosterone and dihydrotestosterone synthesis are now well described. Minor or alternate pathways, which might contribute substantially to androgen production in specific states, have also emerged. Likewise, the requirement of androgen for prostate formation and growth date back over a half-century, and the dependence of prostate cancer on androgens has been known and exploited for as long. Despite the success of testicular removal or suppression, androgen receptor antagonists, and androgen synthesis inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer, the sources of androgen, their routes of synthesis, and the contributions of various routes remain topics of debate, particularly in castration-resistant disease when circulating androgens are very low. Here we review the major pathways of 19-carbon steroid synthesis in the adrenal and gonad, peripheral pathways to active androgens, and recent data charting flux of androgen precursors in prostate cancer.

NY-ESO-1 cancer testis antigen demonstrates high immunogenicity in triple negative breast cancer.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-06-28,"NY-ESO-1 cancer testis (CT) antigen is an attractive candidate for immunotherapy as a result of its high immunogenicity. The aim of this study was to explore the potential for NY-ESO-1 antigen directed immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by determining the frequency of expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the degree of inherent immunogenicity to NY-ESO-1. 168 TNBC and 47 ER+/HER2- primary breast cancer specimens were used to determine NY-ESO-1 frequency by IHC. As previous studies have shown that patients with a robust innate humoral immune response to CT antigens are more likely to develop CD8 T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1 peptides, we evaluated the degree to which patients with NY-ESO-1 expression had inherent immunogenicity by measuring antibodies. The relationship between NY-ESO-1 expression and CD8+ T lymphocytes was also examined. The frequency of NY-ESO-1 expression in the TNBC cohort was 16% versus 2% in ER+/HER2- patients. A higher NY-ESO-1 score was associated with a younger age at diagnosis in the TNBC patients with NY-ESO-1 expression (p = 0.026). No differences in OS (p = 0.278) or PFS (p = 0.238) by NY-ESO-1 expression status were detected. Antibody responses to NY-ESO-1 were found in 73% of TNBC patients whose tumors were NY-ESO-1 positive. NY-ESO-1 positive patients had higher CD8 counts than negative patients (p = 0.018). NY-ESO-1 is expressed in a substantial subset of TNBC patients and leads to a high humoral immune response in a large proportion of these individuals. Given these observations, patients with TNBC may benefit from targeted therapies directed against NY-ESO-1.",Journal Article,2763.0,57.0,NY-ESO-1 testis CT antigen attractive candidate immunotherapy high immunogenicity aim explore potential NY-ESO-1 antigen directed immunotherapy triple negative breast TNBC determining frequency expression immunohistochemistry IHC degree inherent immunogenicity NY-ESO-1 168 TNBC 47 ER+/HER2- primary breast specimens determine NY-ESO-1 frequency IHC previous studies shown patients robust innate humoral immune response CT antigens likely develop CD8 T-cell responses NY-ESO-1 peptides evaluated degree patients NY-ESO-1 expression inherent immunogenicity measuring antibodies relationship NY-ESO-1 expression CD8+ lymphocytes examined frequency NY-ESO-1 expression TNBC cohort 16 versus 2 ER+/HER2- patients higher NY-ESO-1 score associated younger age diagnosis TNBC patients NY-ESO-1 expression p 0.026 differences OS p 0.278 PFS p 0.238 NY-ESO-1 expression status detected Antibody responses NY-ESO-1 73 TNBC patients NY-ESO-1 positive NY-ESO-1 positive patients higher CD8 counts negative patients p 0.018 NY-ESO-1 expressed substantial subset TNBC patients leads high humoral immune response large proportion individuals Given observations patients TNBC benefit targeted therapies directed NY-ESO-1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2906, 3143, 14, 12, 425, 448, 16, 35, 3059, 1609, 9, 726, 22, 8, 757, 1, 211, 64, 4050, 3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1645, 3, 174, 9, 2906, 3143, 14, 448, 1166, 726, 4, 1500, 199, 12, 1403, 20, 2196, 3, 675, 1, 55, 20, 888, 1289, 2, 3, 1444, 1, 4943, 4050, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 5359, 1403, 2, 662, 516, 354, 86, 12, 623, 11, 95, 6, 223, 2906, 3143, 14, 675, 20, 1289, 22, 698, 94, 47, 443, 17, 7, 5, 8, 1922, 3939, 5498, 250, 51, 6, 425, 1575, 32, 80, 322, 6, 690, 968, 102, 31, 253, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 2491, 21, 194, 3, 1444, 6, 92, 7, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 42, 4943, 4050, 20, 2978, 890, 3, 858, 59, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 2, 968, 102, 1594, 10, 120, 409, 3, 675, 1, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 4, 3, 1403, 180, 10, 245, 185, 18, 4, 516, 354, 7, 8, 142, 2906, 3143, 14, 368, 10, 41, 5, 8, 773, 89, 28, 147, 4, 3, 1403, 7, 5, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 19, 13, 4554, 77, 362, 4, 118, 19, 13, 9128, 15, 300, 19, 13, 6883, 20, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 156, 11, 530, 548, 253, 6, 2906, 3143, 14, 11, 204, 4, 803, 1, 1403, 7, 1310, 57, 11, 2906, 3143, 14, 109, 2906, 3143, 14, 109, 7, 42, 142, 968, 1911, 76, 199, 7, 19, 13, 4047, 2906, 3143, 14, 16, 570, 4, 8, 1281, 697, 1, 1403, 7, 2, 1940, 6, 8, 64, 5498, 250, 51, 4, 8, 375, 920, 1, 46, 869, 447, 46, 2172, 7, 5, 1403, 68, 247, 29, 238, 235, 1166, 480, 2906, 3143, 14]",1584.0,22761704,NY-ESO-1 testis antigen demonstrates high immunogenicity triple negative breast,0,0.0
Pathologic characteristics of NUT midline carcinoma arising in the mediastinum.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2012-08-01,"NUT midline carcinomas (NMCs) comprise a group of highly aggressive tumors that have been reported primarily in the head, neck, and mediastinum of younger individuals. These tumors overexpress the nuclear protein in the testis (NUT), most commonly due to a chromosomal translocation that fuses the NUT gene on chromosome 15 with the BRD4 gene on chromosome 19. Although the earliest recognized cases were described in the thymus or mediastinum, an extensive survey for NMCs among malignant thymic or other mediastinal neoplasms has not been reported. We examined NUT expression in 114 cases of poorly differentiated carcinomas or unclassified mediastinal malignancies using a clinically validated NUT-specific monoclonal antibody. Four of 114 (3.5%) cases showed nuclear NUT expression. A NUT translocation was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 3 of these cases. These tumors arose in 2 men and 2 women with a median age of 50 years (range, 28 to 68 y). Three of the tumors were originally diagnosed as undifferentiated epithelioid or round cell malignant neoplasms; 1 tumor contained focal squamous differentiation and was originally diagnosed as a poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma of probable thymic origin. We find that the incidence of NMC within the mediastinum, particularly among undifferentiated tumors, is similar to that reported at other anatomic sites.

"The antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, prevents side-effects incurred by prostate cancer irradiation.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-12,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States. Due to early detection and advances in therapies, more than 90% of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment. Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease; however, while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells, normal tissues are damaged as well. Potential side-effects due to prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, rectal bleeding and incontinence. Currently, radiation therapy for prostate cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage. In the current study, we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP protected skin, prostate, and testes from radiation-induced damage. MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction, a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the penile neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the prostate, where most prostate cancers reside. Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP, in combination with radiation, further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth, we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for prostate cancer.",Journal Article,2687.0,24.0,"Prostate commonly diagnosed estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually United States early detection advances therapies 90 patients survive 10 years post diagnosis treatment Radiation treatment option treat localized disease radiation effective killing normal tissues damaged Potential side-effects prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation erectile dysfunction urethral stricture rectal bleeding incontinence Currently radiation therapy prostate include administration therapeutic agents reduce effects protect normal tissues radiation-induced damage current small molecular weight antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP protects normal tissues radiation-induced damage lower abdomen rats Specifically MnTE-2-PyP protected skin prostate testes radiation-induced damage MnTE-2-PyP protected erectile dysfunction persistent problem regardless type radiation techniques penile neurovascular bundles lay peripheral zones prostate prostate reside Based previous studies showing MnTE-2-PyP combination radiation reduces subcutaneous growth believe MnTE-2-PyP represents excellent radioprotectant combination radiotherapy general specifically prostate",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[12, 16, 3, 96, 841, 265, 12, 5, 35, 661, 4263, 984, 217, 140, 210, 4226, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 520, 6, 191, 638, 2, 954, 4, 235, 80, 76, 424, 1, 7, 303, 4573, 79, 60, 539, 147, 2, 24, 121, 16, 8, 24, 1501, 629, 95, 6, 943, 909, 34, 137, 369, 121, 16, 923, 323, 28, 3003, 30, 37, 295, 742, 32, 9884, 22, 149, 174, 1152, 176, 520, 6, 12, 139, 121, 36, 643, 1659, 1815, 5186, 1527, 6673, 2294, 2, 6152, 694, 121, 36, 9, 12, 1097, 44, 643, 3, 634, 1, 189, 183, 6, 969, 46, 1152, 176, 2, 4869, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 514, 17, 3, 302, 219, 924, 5536, 32022, 18, 32023, 8170, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 280, 4036, 4, 3765, 1225, 32022, 18, 32023, 5541, 2, 13100, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 32022, 18, 32023, 120, 5541, 29, 5186, 1527, 8, 1882, 2497, 1583, 1, 3, 267, 1, 121, 1092, 95, 408, 3, 9848, 16206, 9455, 4, 3, 672, 13814, 1, 3, 1257, 96, 163, 10114, 90, 23, 698, 94, 2069, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 4, 150, 5, 121, 195, 2389, 2529, 30, 129, 21, 4629, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 1449, 35, 1503, 47400, 4, 150, 310, 9, 12, 4, 1083, 2, 1225, 9, 12]",1473.0,22984473,antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP prevents side-effects incurred prostate irradiation,140,0.4745762711864407
Phase I trial of overlapping long peptides from a tumor self-antigen and poly-ICLC shows rapid induction of integrated immune response in ovarian cancer patients.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2012-10-02,"Long peptides are efficiently presented to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after intracellular processing by antigen-presenting cells. To investigate the safety and in vivo immunogenicity of synthetic overlapping long peptides (OLP) from a human tumor self-antigen, we conducted a phase I clinical trial with OLP from cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 in various adjuvant combinations. Twenty-eight patients with advanced ovarian cancer in second or third remission were enrolled sequentially in three cohorts and received at least one vaccination. Patients in Cohort 1 (n = 4) received 1.0 mg OLP, Cohort 2 (n = 13) received OLP in Montanide-ISA-51, and Cohort 3 (n = 11) received OLP + 1.4 mg Poly-ICLC in Montanide-ISA-51 on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. Humoral and cellular responses were evaluated by standardized immunomonitoring techniques (ELISA, ELISPOT assay, intracellular cytokine staining, and tetramer staining). The vaccine was generally well tolerated with injection site reactions and fatigue that resolved. NY-ESO-1-specific antibody and CD8(+) T cells were undetectable after vaccination with OLP alone, but were found in 6 of 13 (46%) and 8 of 13 (62%) patients, respectively, after vaccination with OLP+Montanide, and in 10 of 11 (91%) and 10 of 11 (91%) patients, respectively, after vaccination with OLP+Montanide+Poly-ICLC. NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T cells were detected in all patients with greater frequency and polyclonality when Montanide-ISA-51 was used for vaccination. Inclusion of Poly-ICLC as an adjuvant further accelerated the induction of NY-ESO-1-specific immune responses. The current study shows that NY-ESO-1 OLP vaccine is safe and rapidly induces consistent integrated immune responses (antibody, CD8(+) and CD4(+)) in nearly all vaccinated patients when given with appropriate adjuvants.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2667.0,135.0,Long peptides efficiently presented CD4 CD8 intracellular processing antigen-presenting investigate safety vivo immunogenicity synthetic overlapping long peptides OLP human self-antigen conducted phase clinical trial OLP cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 adjuvant combinations Twenty-eight patients advanced ovarian second remission enrolled sequentially cohorts received vaccination Patients Cohort 1 n 4 received 1.0 mg OLP Cohort 2 n 13 received OLP Montanide-ISA-51 Cohort 3 n 11 received OLP 1.4 mg Poly-ICLC Montanide-ISA-51 weeks 1 4 7 10 13 Humoral cellular responses evaluated standardized immunomonitoring techniques ELISA ELISPOT intracellular cytokine staining tetramer staining vaccine generally tolerated injection site reactions fatigue resolved NY-ESO-1-specific antibody CD8 undetectable vaccination OLP 6 13 46 8 13 62 patients respectively vaccination OLP+Montanide 10 11 91 10 11 91 patients respectively vaccination OLP+Montanide+Poly-ICLC NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 detected patients greater frequency polyclonality Montanide-ISA-51 vaccination Inclusion Poly-ICLC adjuvant accelerated induction NY-ESO-1-specific immune responses current shows NY-ESO-1 OLP vaccine safe rapidly induces consistent integrated immune responses antibody CD8 CD4 nearly vaccinated patients given appropriate adjuvants,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[319, 2491, 32, 4143, 917, 6, 110, 1440, 2, 968, 102, 37, 50, 2087, 3325, 20, 448, 1656, 37, 6, 963, 3, 367, 2, 4, 386, 4050, 1, 3273, 4551, 319, 2491, 11373, 29, 8, 171, 30, 1074, 448, 21, 426, 8, 124, 70, 38, 160, 5, 11373, 29, 12, 7697, 448, 2906, 3143, 14, 4, 747, 249, 1247, 737, 659, 7, 5, 131, 12, 4, 419, 15, 1282, 734, 11, 346, 5455, 4, 169, 736, 2, 103, 28, 506, 104, 1915, 7, 4, 180, 14, 78, 39, 103, 14, 13, 81, 11373, 180, 18, 78, 233, 103, 11373, 4, 11309, 14848, 725, 2, 180, 27, 78, 175, 103, 11373, 14, 39, 81, 2699, 18064, 4, 11309, 14848, 725, 23, 244, 14, 39, 67, 79, 2, 233, 5498, 2, 763, 253, 11, 194, 20, 1670, 39909, 1092, 3664, 7662, 719, 2087, 1675, 1029, 2, 9038, 1029, 3, 1274, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 5, 1754, 606, 2428, 2, 613, 17, 3862, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 548, 2, 968, 102, 37, 11, 3920, 50, 1915, 5, 11373, 279, 84, 11, 204, 4, 49, 1, 233, 641, 2, 66, 1, 233, 744, 7, 106, 50, 1915, 5, 11373, 11309, 2, 4, 79, 1, 175, 970, 2, 79, 1, 175, 970, 7, 106, 50, 1915, 5, 11373, 11309, 2699, 18064, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 1440, 102, 37, 11, 530, 4, 62, 7, 5, 378, 675, 2, 47425, 198, 11309, 14848, 725, 10, 95, 9, 1915, 1680, 1, 2699, 18064, 22, 35, 249, 195, 2241, 3, 504, 1, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 250, 253, 3, 291, 45, 1949, 17, 2906, 3143, 14, 11373, 1274, 16, 1165, 2, 1755, 1516, 925, 2102, 250, 253, 548, 968, 2, 1440, 4, 1857, 62, 5130, 7, 198, 447, 5, 870, 8654]",1739.0,23032745,Phase trial overlapping long peptides self-antigen poly-ICLC shows rapid induction integrated immune response ovarian patients,0,0.0

Granulomatosis and testicular germ cell tumors.,Urology,Urology,2012-10-24,"To determine the cumulative incidence of granulomatous disease among patients with testicular germ cell tumor (GCT) at the University of Pennsylvania and to describe these patients' characteristics and disease outcomes. A computerized search of a large electronic medical database at the University of Pennsylvania was conducted to identify all patients from 1997 to 2012 with a diagnosis of granulomatous disease and GCT. A total of 14 patients were identified. The median age at the diagnosis of GCT was 32.5 years, and the median age at the diagnosis of granulomatous disease was 31 years. Most patients were diagnosed with granulomatous disease either concomitantly or after their diagnosis of GCT. The estimated cumulative incidence of granulomatous disease in patients with GCT at the University of Pennsylvania from 1997 to 2012 was 168.7/100,000.

Patients with testicular cancer undergoing CT surveillance demonstrate a pitfall of radiation-induced cancer risk estimates: the timing paradox.,Radiology,Radiology,2012-12-18,"To demonstrate a limitation of lifetime radiation-induced cancer risk metrics in the setting of testicular cancer surveillance-in particular, their failure to capture the delayed timing of radiation-induced cancers over the course of a patient's lifetime. Institutional review board approval was obtained for the use of computed tomographic (CT) dosimetry data in this study. Informed consent was waived. This study was HIPAA compliant. A Markov model was developed to project outcomes in patients with testicular cancer who were undergoing CT surveillance in the decade after orchiectomy. To quantify effects of early versus delayed risks, life expectancy losses and lifetime mortality risks due to testicular cancer were compared with life expectancy losses and lifetime mortality risks due to radiation-induced cancers from CT. Projections of life expectancy loss, unlike lifetime risk estimates, account for the timing of risks over the course of a lifetime, which enabled evaluation of the described limitation of lifetime risk estimates. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the uncertainty of the results. As an example of evidence yielded, 33-year-old men with stage I seminoma who were undergoing CT surveillance were projected to incur a slightly higher lifetime mortality risk from testicular cancer (598 per 100 000; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 302, 894) than from radiation-induced cancers (505 per 100 000; 95% UI: 280, 730). However, life expectancy loss attributable to testicular cancer (83 days; 95% UI: 42, 124) was more than three times greater than life expectancy loss attributable to radiation-induced cancers (24 days; 95% UI: 13, 35).

Reduced proficiency in homologous recombination underlies the high sensitivity of embryonal carcinoma testicular germ cell tumors to Cisplatin and poly (adp-ribose) polymerase inhibition.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-12-12,"Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT) and patient-derived cell lines are extremely sensitive to cisplatin and other interstrand cross-link (ICL) inducing agents. Nevertheless, a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant or acquire resistance to cisplatin during treatment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications. Herein, we have examined the proficiency of five embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines to repair cisplatin-induced ICLs. Using γH2AX staining as a marker of double strand break formation, we found that EC cell lines were either incapable of or had a reduced ability to repair ICL-induced damage. The defect correlated with reduced Homologous Recombination (HR) repair, as demonstrated by the reduction of RAD51 foci formation and by direct evaluation of HR efficiency using a GFP-reporter substrate. HR-defective tumors cells are known to be sensitive to the treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. In line with this observation, we found that EC cell lines were also sensitive to PARP inhibitor monotherapy. The magnitude of sensitivity correlated with HR-repair reduced proficiency and with the expression levels and activity of PARP1 protein. In addition, we found that PARP inhibition strongly enhanced the response of the most resistant EC cells to cisplatin, by reducing their ability to overcome the damage. These results point to a reduced proficiency of HR repair as a source of sensitivity of ECs to ICL-inducing agents and PARP inhibitor monotherapy, and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP can be exploited to target the stem cell component of the TGCTs (namely ECs) and to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant TGCTs to standard treatments.",Journal Article,2596.0,40.0,Testicular Germ TGCT patient-derived lines extremely sensitive cisplatin interstrand cross-link ICL inducing agents subset TGCTs innately resistant acquire resistance cisplatin treatment Understanding mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance cisplatin identification novel strategies target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs major clinical implications examined proficiency embryonal carcinoma EC lines repair cisplatin-induced ICLs γH2AX staining marker double strand break formation EC lines incapable reduced ability repair ICL-induced damage defect correlated reduced Homologous Recombination HR repair demonstrated reduction RAD51 foci formation direct evaluation HR efficiency GFP-reporter substrate HR-defective known sensitive treatment poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP inhibitor line observation EC lines sensitive PARP inhibitor monotherapy magnitude sensitivity correlated HR-repair reduced proficiency expression levels activity PARP1 addition PARP inhibition strongly enhanced response resistant EC cisplatin reducing ability overcome damage point reduced proficiency HR repair source sensitivity ECs ICL-inducing agents PARP inhibitor monotherapy suggest pharmacological inhibition PARP exploited target stem component TGCTs ECs enhance sensitivity cisplatin-resistant TGCTs standard treatments,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2280, 31, 57, 7122, 2, 69, 526, 31, 285, 32, 2938, 745, 6, 540, 2, 127, 19542, 1383, 3460, 17521, 1958, 183, 3873, 8, 697, 1, 15427, 32, 361, 35081, 436, 15, 6206, 251, 6, 540, 190, 24, 612, 3, 483, 1181, 7122, 485, 251, 6, 540, 22, 149, 22, 3, 911, 1, 229, 422, 6, 283, 540, 436, 15427, 47, 458, 38, 1268, 1986, 21, 47, 409, 3, 11266, 1, 365, 5239, 134, 2180, 31, 285, 6, 972, 540, 277, 35493, 75, 11363, 1029, 22, 8, 952, 1, 1627, 4787, 4338, 1264, 21, 204, 17, 2180, 31, 285, 11, 361, 20290, 1, 15, 42, 8, 405, 801, 6, 972, 17521, 277, 1350, 3, 5398, 438, 5, 405, 3894, 4017, 168, 972, 22, 264, 20, 3, 628, 1, 4671, 3340, 1264, 2, 20, 1196, 451, 1, 168, 2904, 75, 8, 4687, 3674, 4235, 168, 4552, 57, 37, 32, 440, 6, 40, 745, 6, 3, 24, 5, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2041, 230, 4, 328, 5, 26, 1664, 21, 204, 17, 2180, 31, 285, 11, 120, 745, 6, 2041, 230, 1411, 3, 3131, 1, 485, 438, 5, 168, 972, 405, 11266, 2, 5, 3, 55, 148, 2, 128, 1, 6033, 178, 4, 352, 21, 204, 17, 2041, 297, 1327, 651, 3, 51, 1, 3, 96, 436, 2180, 37, 6, 540, 20, 1818, 136, 801, 6, 1768, 3, 1350, 46, 99, 741, 6, 8, 405, 11266, 1, 168, 972, 22, 8, 2353, 1, 485, 1, 5861, 6, 17521, 1958, 183, 2, 2041, 230, 1411, 2, 309, 17, 3419, 297, 1, 2041, 122, 40, 5177, 6, 283, 3, 452, 31, 1249, 1, 3, 15427, 5046, 5861, 2, 6, 1304, 3, 485, 1, 540, 436, 15427, 6, 260, 640]",1825.0,23251575,Reduced proficiency homologous recombination underlies high sensitivity embryonal carcinoma testicular germ Cisplatin poly adp-ribose polymerase inhibition,0,0.0

Molecular pathways: Inhibiting steroid biosynthesis in prostate cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-03-07,"A significant proportion of castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) remains driven by ligand activation of the androgen receptor. Although the testes are the primary source of testosterone, testosterone can also be produced from peripheral conversion of adrenal sex hormone precursors DHEA and androstenedione in the prostate and other tissues. CYP17A1 catalyzes two essential reactions in the production of DHEA and androstenedione: the hydroxylation (hydroxylase activity) and the subsequent cleavage of the C17-20 side chain (lyase activity). Potent and selective inhibition of CYP17A1 by abiraterone depletes residual nongonadal androgens and is an effective treatment for CRPC. Elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie resistance to abiraterone will inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies post-abiraterone. Preclinical evidence that androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer cells does not necessarily follow a single dominant pathway, and residual androgens or alternative ligands (including administered glucocorticoids) can reactivate androgen receptor signaling, supports cotargeting of more than one enzyme involved in steroidogenesis and combining a CYP17A1 inhibitor with an antiandrogen.

Testicular germ cell tumors: biology and clinical update.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2013-05-01,"To discuss several important developments in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) in the past year. Germ cell function and tumorigenesis may be influenced by exposure to a variety of agents, including metals and cannabinoids. Genome-wide association studies have identified variants in several genes that may produce susceptibility to the development of testicular malignancies, and expression of certain proteins predicts a poorer prognosis and may, thus, play a role in neoplastic progression. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection continues to play a crucial role in definitive treatment of patients with nonseminoma germ cell tumor, whereas radiotherapy, as a standard treatment for early-stage seminoma, has been declining due both to the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and to the increased risk of radiation-related secondary malignancies.

However, up to now, the molecular mechanisms behind this exceptional responsiveness to DNA-damaging agents have remained unclear. A hypersensitive apoptotic response, as well as a reduction in the proficiency to repair cisplatin-induced DNA damage might account for this behavior.

By performing a microarray meta-analysis of seminomas and spermatogonial stem cells, we investigated a putative cell of origin for seminoma. We obtained published microarray data for 6 human adult germ cell lines, 16 embryonic stem cell lines, 3 normal testicular tissue samples, and 40 seminomas from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. By assessing correlations between various tissue microarrays, we determined the number of transitional events and the distance between seminomas and human spermatogonial stem cells. Our meta-analysis showed that spermatogonial stem cells correlated similarly with seminoma (95% CI of Spearman ρ, 0.33-0.44) and with normal somatic testicular tissue cells (95% CI, 0.39-0.40), which suggests parallel paths of cellular origins.

Clinically atypical seminomas with yolk sac tumor features.,The Canadian journal of urology,Can J Urol,2013-08-01,"A small subset of young men die from seminoma. Studying these high risk, clinically atypical seminomas (CASs)-aggressive tumors with visceral metastases and chemotherapy resistance-may provide clues to the nature of drug resistance and the origin of testicular cancers. We explored the possibility that these seminomas are a unique clinical and biologic entity with intrinsic yolk sac tumor (YST) features. We assayed available archived tissue samples (n = 22) for chemotherapy-resistance markers found in YSTs. Specifically, we analyzed tissues and clinical histories from patients with CASs (those who had visceral metastases and recurrent disease), classical seminomas, and mixed germ-cell tumors containing YST. By using immunohistochemical testing, we evaluated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2, alpha fetoprotein, and glutathione S-transferase (pi) [GST (pi)]. GST (pi) expression significantly predicted for overall survival (p = .036). In addition, according to the results of GST (pi) immunohistochemical staining, the CASs appeared to resemble YSTs more than they did classical seminomas (p = 0.043). Less-advanced tumors, both those that expressed GST (pi) and those that were negative for GST (pi), were more amenable to local therapies, and the patients who had those tumors had better clinical outcomes. Results from this exploratory study suggest that certain CASs that express GST (pi) are more similar to YST than they are to classical seminomas, and that GST (pi) expression may be able to be used as a prognosticator of disease-specific survival. Such CASs thus may have a unique biologic origin that differs from that of classical seminomas.

This study assessed the relationship between cancer research efforts in terms of planned randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrollment, objective measures of evidence quality, and a cancer's burden on society. The authors calculated the planned RCT enrollment listed on ClinicalTrials.gov for the 17 most prevalent solid cancers. Using cancer type as the unit of analysis, linear regression was used to examine the association between planned enrollment in RCTs and 1) evidence quality, as measured by the absolute number and percent of highest quality category (category 1 [C1]) recommendations in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for each cancer, and 2) measures of burden on society, including prevalence, incidence, person-years of life lost (PYLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Non-normal distributions were log transformed when appropriate. Overall, 15% of the NCCN recommendations were based on the highest quality evidence. Results produced 1260 RCTs. Planned RCT enrollment ranged from 2270 (testis) to 492,876 (breast) and was correlated neither with absolute number nor percent of C1 recommendations for that cancer. Planned RCT enrollment was positively correlated with a cancer's prevalence (P=.01), incidence (P<.01), PYLL (P<.01), and DALY (P<0.01). In multivariate analysis, prevalence (P<.01) and PYLL (P<.01) had the strongest association with planned RCT enrollment. Findings showed, therefore, that planned cancer RCT enrollment is associated with higher societal disease burden, not the quality of a cancer's clinical guidelines.

A gain-of-function mutation in DHT synthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,Cell,Cell,2013-08-01,"Growth of prostate cancer cells is dependent upon androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen, is usually synthesized in the prostate from testosterone secreted by the testis. Following chemical or surgical castration, prostate cancers usually shrink owing to testosterone deprivation. However, tumors often recur, forming castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses a gain-of-stability mutation that leads to a gain-of-function in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3βHSD1), which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in conversion of the adrenal-derived steroid dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT. The mutation (N367T) does not affect catalytic function, but it renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to profound accumulation. Whereas dehydroepiandrosterone conversion to DHT is usually very limited, expression of 367T accelerates this conversion and provides the DHT necessary to activate the AR. We suggest that 3βHSD1 is a valid target for the treatment of CRPC.

Comparison of address-based sampling and random-digit dialing methods for recruiting young men as controls in a case-control study of testicular cancer susceptibility.,American journal of epidemiology,Am. J. Epidemiol.,2013-09-05,"Random-digit dialing (RDD) using landline telephone numbers is the historical gold standard for control recruitment in population-based epidemiologic research. However, increasing cell-phone usage and diminishing response rates suggest that the effectiveness of RDD in recruiting a random sample of the general population, particularly for younger target populations, is decreasing. In this study, we compared landline RDD with alternative methods of control recruitment, including RDD using cell-phone numbers and address-based sampling (ABS), to recruit primarily white men aged 18-55 years into a study of testicular cancer susceptibility conducted in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area between 2009 and 2012. With few exceptions, eligible and enrolled controls recruited by means of RDD and ABS were similar with regard to characteristics for which data were collected on the screening survey. While we find ABS to be a comparably effective method of recruiting young males compared with landline RDD, we acknowledge the potential impact that selection bias may have had on our results because of poor overall response rates, which ranged from 11.4% for landline RDD to 1.7% for ABS.

Update in systemic therapy of urologic malignancies.,Postgraduate medicine,Postgrad Med,2014-01-01,"Systemic therapy of advanced prostate and renal cancers has gained several recent additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. Treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer now includes additional immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), chemotherapy (cabazitaxel), androgen-signaling inhibitors (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide), and a radiopharmaceutical (alpharadin), based on extension of patient survival. Similarly, therapy for patients with renal cell carcinoma, a chemoresistant malignancy, has undergone dramatic changes based on an understanding of the role of angiogenesis. Multiple vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (temsirolimus, everolimus) have been added to the therapeutic arsenal. Additionally, immunotherapy retains an important treatment role, with a continuing application of high-dose interleukin-2 in select patients and the emergence of novel immunotherapeutic agents that may have significant benefit. Other major urologic malignancies, including urothelial, testicular, and penile cancers, have witnessed relatively few or no recent advances in therapy, although testicular germ cell tumors are one of the most curable malignancies. An agent for treatment of advanced urothelial cancer now has commercial approval, the chemotherapeutic agent, vinflunine, as second-line therapy in multiple countries-but not in the United States. Our review summarizes and updates the field of systemic therapy for advanced urologic malignancies, with a focus on castration-resistant prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma.

Enhancement of tumor-reactive cytotoxic CD4+ T cell responses after ipilimumab treatment in four advanced melanoma patients.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2013-10-01,"CD4(+) T cells provide help to enhance and sustain cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses. A direct lytic role for this cell population in mouse models further supports the use of tumor-reactive CD4(+) T cells for cancer immunotherapy. CTLA-4 blockade has been shown to expand antigen-specific cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells in mouse models. We took advantage of spontaneous immunity to the NY-ESO-1 cancer-testis antigen to investigate quantitative and qualitative changes in antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses after ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) treatment in advanced melanoma patients. Four NY-ESO-1 seropositive melanoma patients were chosen upon the availability of suitable blood specimens for characterizing the functions of NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell response by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and cytotoxicity assays. Multiple NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses with Th1 dominance were induced or enhanced after ipilimumab treatment in peripheral blood in all four patients. NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell lines established from all 4 patients after ipilimumab treatment recognized naturally processed NY-ESO-1 protein in antigen-presenting cells, expressed master transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) and secreted perforin and Granzyme B. Finally, we demonstrated that these NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell lines directly lysed autologous melanoma cell lines expressing NY-ESO-1 in an MHC class II restricted manner. Our results show that antigen specific cytotoxic CD4(+) T cell responses are induced after ipilimumab therapy in human cancer patients. Ipilimumab may induce the expression of lytic granules on antigen specific cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells via Eomes, revealing a novel consequence of immunologic checkpoint blockade.

NUT midline carcinoma: an aggressive intrathoracic neoplasm.,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,J Thorac Oncol,2013-10-01,"Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline carcinoma (NMC) is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that is characterized by a balanced translocation between chromosomes 15 and 19 [t(15;19)(q14;p13.1)]. This genetic aberration results in the fusion of the NUT gene on chromosome 15 to the bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) gene on chromosome 19. The resultant BRD4-NUT fusion oncogene leads to global hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression of genes required for differentiation."" Although it was first reported in 1991 by Kubonishi et al., awareness of this condition remains low and the diagnosis is overlooked initially in a number of patients. A 36-year-old man complained of cough and right-sided chest pain for 3 weeks before presentation. Imaging studies revealed a right hilar mass, and a bronchoscopic biopsy was consistent with an aggressive poorly differentiated neoplasm. A combination of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide was administered for two cycles without any improvement. A repeat core biopsy showed focal squamous differentiation; and given the clinical presentation along with the histologic features, NMC was considered in the differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemical staining for NUT was positive, and dual-color break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated BRD4-NUT rearrangement, thereby confirming a diagnosis of NMC. Our patient was subsequently enrolled on a phase 1 clinical trial of a novel, orally bioavailable bromodomain and extra terminal inhibitor, GSK525762 (NCT01587703).

Simultaneous cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression of melanoma antigen-A family and NY-ESO-1 cancer-testis antigens represents an independent marker for poor survival in head and neck cancer.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2014-02-11,"The prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients remains poor. The identification of high-risk subgroups is needed for the development of custom-tailored therapies. The expression of cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) has been linked to a worse prognosis in other cancer types; however, their prognostic value in HNSCC is unclear because only few patients have been examined and data on CTA protein expression are sparse. A tissue microarray consisting of tumor samples from 453 HNSCC patients was evaluated for the expression of CTA proteins using immunohistochemistry. Frequency of expression and the subcellular expression pattern (nuclear, cytoplasmic, or both) was recorded. Protein expression of melanoma antigen (MAGE)-A family CTA, MAGE-C family CTA and NY-ESO-1 was found in approximately 30, 7 and 4% of tumors, respectively. The subcellular expression pattern in particular had a marked impact on the patients' prognosis. Median overall survival (OS) of patients with (i) simultaneous cytoplasmic and nuclear expression compared to (ii) either cytoplasmic or nuclear expression and (iii) negative patients was 23.0 versus 109.0 versus 102.5 months, for pan-MAGE (p < 0.0001), 46.6 versus 50.0 versus 109.0 for MAGE-A3/A4 (p = 0.0074) and 13.3 versus 50.0 versus 100.2 months for NY-ESO-1 (p = 0.0019). By multivariate analysis, these factors were confirmed as independent markers for poor survival. HNSCC patients showing protein expression of MAGE-A family members or NY-ESO-1 represent a subgroup with an extraordinarily poor survival. The development of immunotherapeutic strategies targeting these CTA may, therefore, be a promising approach to improve the outcome of HNSCC patients.

Greater decrease in circulating monocyte gate MDSC Lin1-/HLA-DR-/CD33⁺/CD11b⁺ was associated with improved PFS (p = 0.03). There was a significant increase in circulating regulatory T cells (Treg; CD4⁺CD25hi⁺Foxp3⁺) that, unexpectedly, was associated with improved PFS (HR = 0.57; p = 0.034). Baseline evidence of fully activated type I CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ antigen-specific T cell immunity against cancer-testis (NY-ESO-1) and melanocytic lineage (MART-1, gp100) antigens was detected and was significantly potentiated after ipilimumab. In tumor, there was a significant increase in CD8⁺ T cells after ipilimumab (p = 0.02). Ipilimumab induced increased tumor infiltration by fully activated (CD69⁺) CD3⁺/CD4⁺ and CD3⁺/CD8⁺ T cells with evidence of induction/potentiation of memory T cells (CD45RO⁺). The change in Treg observed within the tumor showed an inverse relationship with clinical benefit and greater decrease in tumor MDSC subset Lin1-/HLA-DR-/CD33⁺/CD11b⁺ was associated with improved PFS at one year.

Of the 48 patients 37 underwent surveillance without retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, including 34 with no high risk feature and 3 with 1. Median followup was 14.5 months (IQR 6.9-32.5). No patient experienced recurrence. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection was performed in 11 patients, including 6 with clinical stage I disease and 2 or more high risk features who underwent early dissection, 2 with clinical stage IIa disease at diagnosis who underwent early dissection and 3 with clinical stage I disease and 2 or more high risk features who were observed elsewhere but referred to our institution due to retroperitoneal disease. Six patients with clinical stage I disease underwent early dissection, 4 had no evidence of disease at a median followup of 6.6 years and 2 experienced recurrence and died of disease.

Epigenetic potentiation of NY-ESO-1 vaccine therapy in human ovarian cancer.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2014-01-01,"The cancer-testis/cancer-germline antigen NY-ESO-1 is a vaccine target in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but its limited expression is a barrier to vaccine efficacy. As NY-ESO-1 is regulated by DNA methylation, we hypothesized that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors may augment NY-ESO-1 vaccine therapy. In agreement, global DNA hypomethylation in EOC was associated with the presence of circulating antibodies to NY-ESO-1. Pre-clinical studies using EOC cell lines showed that decitabine treatment enhanced both NY-ESO-1 expression and NY-ESO-1-specific CTL-mediated responses. Based on these observations, we performed a phase I dose-escalation trial of decitabine, as an addition to NY-ESO-1 vaccine and doxorubicin liposome (doxorubicin) chemotherapy, in 12 patients with relapsed EOC. The regimen was safe, with limited and clinically manageable toxicities. Both global and promoter-specific DNA hypomethylation occurred in blood and circulating DNAs, the latter of which may reflect tumor cell responses. Increased NY-ESO-1 serum antibodies and T cell responses were observed in the majority of patients, and antibody spreading to additional tumor antigens was also observed. Finally, disease stabilization or partial clinical response occurred in 6/10 evaluable patients. Based on these encouraging results, evaluation of similar combinatorial chemo-immunotherapy regimens in EOC and other tumor types is warranted.

Immune regulation by low doses of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine in common human epithelial cancers.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2014-02-01,"Epigenetic therapy is emerging as a potential therapy for solid tumors. To investigate its mechanism of action, we performed integrative expression and methylation analysis of 63 cancer cell lines (breast, colorectal, and ovarian) after treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine (AZA). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for immunomodulatory pathways in all three cancers (14.4-31.3%) including interferon signaling, antigen processing and presentation, and cytokines/chemokines. Strong upregulation of cancer testis antigens was also observed. An AZA IMmune gene set (AIMs) derived from the union of these immunomodulatory pathway genes classified primary tumors from all three types, into ""high"" and ""low"" AIM gene expression subsets in tumor expression data from both TCGA and GEO.

Extramedullary relapse following total marrow and lymphoid irradiation in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2014-05-01,"Approximately 5% to 20% of patients who undergo total body irradiation (TBI) in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can develop extramedullary (EM) relapse. Whereas total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) provides a more conformally targeted radiation therapy for patients, organ sparing has the potential to place the patient at a higher risk for EM relapse than TBI. This study evaluated EM relapse in patients treated with TMLI at our institution. Patients eligible for analysis had been enrolled in 1 of 3 prospective TMLI trials between 2006 and 2012. The TMLI targeted bones, major lymph node chains, liver, spleen, testes, and brain, using image-guided tomotherapy with total dose ranging from 12 to 15 Gy. A total of 101 patients with a median age of 47 years were studied. The median follow-up was 12.8 months. Incidence of EM relapse and bone marrow (BM) relapse were 12.9% and 25.7%, respectively. Of the 13 patients who had EM relapse, 4 also had BM relapse, and 7 had EM disease prior to HCT. There were a total of 19 EM relapse sites as the site of initial recurrence: 11 soft tissue, 6 lymph node, 2 skin. Nine of these sites were within the target region and received ≥12 Gy. Ten initial EM relapse sites were outside of the target region: 5 sites received 10.1 to 11.4 Gy while 5 sites received <10 Gy. Pretransplantation EM was the only significant predictor of subsequent EM relapse. The cumulative incidence of EM relapse was 4% at 1 year and 11.4% at 2 years. EM relapse incidence was as frequent in regions receiving ≥10 Gy as those receiving <10 Gy. EM relapse rates following TMLI that included HCT regimens were comparable to published results with regimens including TBI and suggest that TMLI is not associated with an increased EM relapse risk.",Clinical Trial,2091.0,12.0,Approximately 5 20 patients undergo total body irradiation TBI preparation hematopoietic transplantation HCT develop extramedullary EM relapse total marrow lymphoid irradiation TMLI provides conformally targeted radiation therapy patients organ sparing potential place patient higher risk EM relapse TBI evaluated EM relapse patients treated TMLI institution Patients eligible enrolled 1 3 prospective TMLI trials 2006 2012 TMLI targeted bones major lymph node chains liver spleen testes brain image-guided tomotherapy total dose ranging 12 15 Gy total 101 patients median age 47 years studied median follow-up 12.8 months Incidence EM relapse bone marrow BM relapse 12.9 25.7 respectively 13 patients EM relapse 4 BM relapse 7 EM disease prior HCT total 19 EM relapse sites site initial recurrence 11 soft tissue 6 lymph node 2 skin sites target region received ≥12 Gy initial EM relapse sites outside target region 5 sites received 10.1 11.4 Gy 5 sites received 10 Gy Pretransplantation EM significant predictor subsequent EM relapse cumulative incidence EM relapse 4 1 year 11.4 2 years EM relapse incidence frequent regions receiving ≥10 Gy receiving 10 Gy EM relapse rates following TMLI included HCT regimens comparable published regimens including TBI suggest TMLI associated increased EM relapse risk,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[705, 33, 6, 179, 1, 7, 54, 1251, 181, 642, 1104, 4889, 4, 4824, 9, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 122, 690, 5508, 7393, 429, 547, 181, 581, 2, 2303, 1104, 15318, 777, 8, 80, 64196, 238, 121, 36, 9, 7, 1259, 1851, 71, 3, 174, 6, 3536, 3, 69, 28, 8, 142, 43, 9, 7393, 429, 76, 4889, 26, 45, 194, 7393, 429, 4, 7, 73, 5, 15318, 28, 114, 731, 7, 625, 9, 65, 42, 85, 346, 4, 14, 1, 27, 482, 15318, 143, 59, 1324, 2, 1195, 3, 15318, 238, 7867, 458, 263, 289, 7802, 4071, 13100, 2, 342, 75, 1482, 1808, 7731, 5, 181, 61, 2223, 29, 133, 6, 167, 381, 8, 181, 1, 2338, 7, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 662, 60, 11, 656, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 133, 66, 53, 287, 1, 7393, 429, 2, 581, 1246, 429, 11, 133, 83, 2, 243, 67, 106, 1, 3, 233, 7, 54, 42, 7393, 429, 39, 120, 42, 1246, 429, 2, 67, 42, 7393, 34, 324, 6, 1085, 125, 11, 8, 181, 1, 326, 7393, 429, 633, 22, 3, 606, 1, 388, 146, 175, 1214, 246, 49, 263, 289, 18, 762, 1, 46, 633, 11, 262, 3, 283, 1053, 2, 103, 9612, 381, 1618, 388, 7393, 429, 633, 11, 2513, 1, 3, 283, 1053, 33, 633, 103, 79, 14, 6, 175, 39, 381, 369, 33, 633, 103, 79, 381, 9367, 7393, 10, 3, 158, 93, 980, 1, 706, 7393, 429, 3, 967, 287, 1, 7393, 429, 10, 39, 28, 14, 111, 2, 175, 39, 28, 18, 60, 7393, 429, 287, 10, 22, 908, 4, 1374, 357, 4556, 381, 22, 135, 357, 79, 381, 7393, 429, 151, 366, 15318, 17, 159, 1085, 472, 11, 1279, 6, 983, 99, 5, 472, 141, 4889, 2, 309, 17, 15318, 16, 44, 41, 5, 35, 101, 7393, 429, 43]",1733.0,24725691,Extramedullary relapse following total marrow lymphoid irradiation patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation,0,0.0

Immunother.,2014-04-23,"Immunization with a combination melanoma helper peptide (6MHP) vaccine has been shown to induce CD4(+) T cell responses, which are associated with patient survival. In the present study, we define the relative immunogenicity and HLA allele promiscuity of individual helper peptides and identify helper peptide-mediated augmentation of specific CD8(+) T cell responses. Thirty-seven participants with stage IIIB-IV melanoma were vaccinated with 6MHP in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The 6MHP vaccine is comprised of 6 peptides representing melanocytic differentiation proteins gp100, tyrosinase, Melan-A/MART-1, and cancer testis antigens from the MAGE family. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses were assessed in peripheral blood and in sentinel immunized nodes (SIN) by thymidine uptake after exposure to helper peptides and by direct interferon-γ ELIspot assay against 14 MHC class I-restricted peptides. Vaccine-induced CD4(+) T cell responses to individual epitopes were detected in the SIN of 63 % (22/35) and in the peripheral blood of 38 % (14/37) of participants for an overall response rate of 65 % (24/37). The most frequently immunogenic peptides were MAGE-A3281-295 (49 %) and tyrosinase386-406 (32 %). Responses were not limited to HLA restrictions originally described. Vaccine-associated CD8(+) T cell responses against class I-restricted peptides were observed in 45 % (5/11) of evaluable participants.

Tumor subtype-specific cancer-testis antigens as potential biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets for cancers.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2013-11-25,"Cancer-testis (CT) antigens are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their restricted expression in immune-privileged germ cells and various malignancies. Current application of CT-based immunotherapy has been focused on CT expression-rich tumors such as melanoma and lung cancers. In this study, we surveyed CT expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets for ten common cancer types. We show that CT expression is specific and enriched within certain cancer molecular subtypes. For example, HORMAD1, CXorf61, ACTL8, and PRAME are highly enriched in the basal subtype of breast cancer; MAGE and CSAG are most frequently activated in the magnoid subtype of lung adenocarcinoma; and PRAME is highly upregulated in the ccB subtype of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Analysis of CT gene expression and DNA methylation indicates that some CTs are regulated epigenetically, whereas others are controlled primarily by tissue- and subtype-specific transcription factors. Our results suggest that although for some CT expression is associated with patient outcome, not many are independent prognostic markers. Thus, CTs with shared expression pattern are heterogeneous molecules with distinct activation modes and functional properties in different cancers and cancer subtypes. These data suggest a cancer subtype-orientated application of CT antigen as biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets.",Journal Article,2248.0,37.0,Cancer-testis CT antigens potential targets immunotherapy restricted expression immune-privileged germ malignancies Current application CT-based immunotherapy focused CT expression-rich melanoma lung surveyed CT expression Genome Atlas TCGA datasets common types CT expression specific enriched certain molecular subtypes example HORMAD1 CXorf61 ACTL8 PRAME highly enriched basal subtype breast MAGE CSAG frequently activated magnoid subtype lung adenocarcinoma PRAME highly upregulated ccB subtype clear renal carcinoma CT expression DNA methylation indicates CTs regulated epigenetically controlled primarily tissue- subtype-specific transcription factors suggest CT expression associated patient outcome independent prognostic markers CTs shared expression pattern heterogeneous molecules distinct activation modes functional properties different subtypes suggest subtype-orientated application CT antigen biomarkers immunotherapeutic targets,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 7697, 425, 1575, 32, 174, 637, 9, 12, 726, 408, 1, 136, 2016, 55, 4, 250, 24419, 2280, 37, 2, 747, 441, 291, 1581, 1, 425, 90, 726, 71, 85, 1649, 23, 425, 55, 3697, 57, 225, 22, 2, 163, 4, 26, 45, 21, 3696, 425, 55, 75, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 2959, 3455, 9, 1618, 186, 12, 630, 21, 514, 17, 425, 55, 16, 112, 2, 2220, 262, 1840, 12, 219, 814, 9, 2685, 27198, 64263, 64264, 2, 13120, 32, 561, 2220, 4, 3, 2135, 875, 1, 12, 4871, 2, 46096, 32, 96, 746, 735, 4, 3, 44522, 875, 1, 449, 2, 13120, 16, 561, 2684, 4, 3, 14299, 875, 1, 885, 31, 31, 134, 65, 1, 425, 145, 55, 2, 261, 569, 2640, 17, 476, 6835, 32, 1065, 8976, 547, 1749, 32, 1149, 1561, 20, 246, 2, 875, 112, 866, 130, 114, 99, 309, 17, 242, 9, 476, 425, 55, 16, 41, 5, 69, 228, 44, 445, 32, 306, 177, 525, 631, 6835, 5, 2664, 55, 1177, 32, 1564, 1598, 5, 834, 363, 8256, 2, 583, 1571, 4, 338, 163, 2, 12, 814, 46, 74, 309, 8, 12, 875, 46371, 1581, 1, 425, 448, 22, 582, 2, 3222, 637]",1362.0,24764584,subtype-specific cancer-testis antigens potential biomarkers immunotherapeutic targets,1,0.003389830508474576
NY-ESO-1 expression in meningioma suggests a rationale for new immunotherapeutic approaches.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2013-08-05,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for these tumors. However, a significant number of tumors are not surgically accessible, recur, or become malignant, necessitating the repetition of surgery and sometimes radiation. Chemotherapy is rarely used and is generally not recognized as an effective treatment. Cancer/testis (CT) genes represent a unique class of genes, which are expressed by germ cells, normally silenced in somatic cells, but activated in various cancers. CT proteins can elicit spontaneous immune responses in patients with cancer and this feature makes them attractive targets for immunotherapy-based approaches. We analyzed mRNA expression of 37 testis-restricted CT genes in a discovery set of 18 meningiomas by reverse transcription PCR. The overall frequency of expression of CT genes ranged from 5.6% to 27.8%. The most frequently expressed was NY-ESO-1, in 5 patients (27.8%). We subsequently analyzed NY-ESO-1 protein expression in a larger set of meningiomas by immunohistochemistry and found expression in 108 of 110 cases. In some cases, NY-ESO-1 expression was diffused and homogenous, but in most instances it was heterogeneous.

Cancer-testis antigen 7 expression and immune responses following allogeneic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2014-03-03,"Cancer-testis antigen 7 (CT7) is the most frequently and consistently expressed MAGE antigen in multiple myeloma, exhibits tissue-restricted expression, and is an independent negative prognostic factor for multiple myeloma. We sought to characterize CT7 protein expression in the bone marrow of patients with multiple myeloma undergoing allogeneic T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloTCD-HSCT), and to examine the significance of CT7-specific cellular immune responses. We further aimed to determine CT7-derived immunogenic epitopes and their associated allelic restrictions. CT7 protein expression in neoplastic CD138(+) plasma cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsies from 10 patients. CT7 was present in 8 of 10 patients. Longitudinal analyses of the 10 patients revealed an association between CT7 expression and prognosis. Longitudinal monitoring of CT7-specific T cells revealed an association between increased frequencies of CT7-specific T cells and reductions in specific myeloma markers. Epitope-specific reactivity to the nonamer FLAMLKNTV was detected by intracellular IFNγ assay in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow-derived T cells from HLA-A*0201(+) patients. Serial monitoring of PB CT7-specific T-cell frequencies in 4 HLA-A*0201(+) patients by HLA-A*0201-CT7(1087-1095) tetramer staining revealed an association with disease course. Phenotypic analyses revealed bone marrow enrichment for central memory CT7-specific T cells, while effector memory cells dominated the PB.

Pathway-based analysis of GWAs data identifies association of sex determination genes with susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2014-06-18,"Genome-wide association (GWA) studies of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) have identified 18 susceptibility loci, some containing genes encoding proteins important in male germ cell development. Deletions of one of these genes, DMRT1, lead to male-to-female sex reversal and are associated with development of gonadoblastoma. To further explore genetic association with TGCT, we undertook a pathway-based analysis of SNP marker associations in the Penn GWAs (349 TGCT cases and 919 controls). We analyzed a custom-built sex determination gene set consisting of 32 genes using three different methods of pathway-based analysis. The sex determination gene set ranked highly compared with canonical gene sets, and it was associated with TGCT (FDRG = 2.28 × 10(-5), FDRM = 0.014 and FDRI = 0.008 for Gene Set Analysis-SNP (GSA-SNP), Meta-Analysis Gene Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA) and Improved Gene Set Enrichment Analysis for Genome-wide Association Study (i-GSEA4GWAS) analysis, respectively). The association remained after removal of DMRT1 from the gene set (FDRG = 0.0002, FDRM = 0.055 and FDRI = 0.009). Using data from the NCI GWA scan (582 TGCT cases and 1056 controls) and UK scan (986 TGCT cases and 4946 controls), we replicated these findings (NCI: FDRG = 0.006, FDRM = 0.014, FDRI = 0.033, and UK: FDRG = 1.04 × 10(-6), FDRM = 0.016, FDRI = 0.025).

NY-ESO-1 as a potential immunotherapeutic target in renal cell carcinoma.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2014-07-01,"Novel immune therapies targeting tumor specific antigens are being developed. Our purpose was to determine expression of the cancer testes antigen NY-ESO-1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as NY-ESO-1 targeting approaches, particularly adoptive cell therapy, have not been evaluated in this disease. We employed tissue microarrays containing >300 unique RCC cases and adjacent benign renal tissue to determine NY-ESO-1 expression using a quantitative immunofluorescence method. In addition, we studied NY-ESO-1 expression in 35 matched primary and metastatic RCC specimens to assess concordance between different tumor sites. NY-ESO-1 was highly expressed in a subset of RCCs. Expression in primary RCC specimens was significantly higher than adjacent normal renal tissue (P<0.0001) and higher in clear cell carcinomas than papillary RCC (P<0.0001). Expression levels in metastatic specimens were higher than in matched primary samples (P=0.0018), and the correlation between the two sites was modest (χ2=3.5, p=0.06). Aberrant NY-ESO-1 expression seen in clear cell RCC suggests that NY-ESO-1 targeting approaches should be studied in this disease. Expression is higher in metastatic sites, and discordance between primary and metastatic sites in some patients suggests that patient selection for these therapies should be based on expression in metastatic rather than nephrectomy specimens.",Journal Article,2030.0,4.0,Novel immune therapies targeting specific antigens developed purpose determine expression testes antigen NY-ESO-1 renal carcinoma RCC NY-ESO-1 targeting approaches particularly adoptive therapy evaluated disease employed tissue microarrays containing 300 unique RCC cases adjacent benign renal tissue determine NY-ESO-1 expression quantitative immunofluorescence addition studied NY-ESO-1 expression 35 matched primary metastatic RCC specimens assess concordance different sites NY-ESO-1 highly expressed subset RCCs Expression primary RCC specimens significantly higher adjacent normal renal tissue P 0.0001 higher clear carcinomas papillary RCC P 0.0001 Expression levels metastatic specimens higher matched primary P=0.0018 correlation sites modest χ2=3.5 p=0.06 Aberrant NY-ESO-1 expression seen clear RCC suggests NY-ESO-1 targeting approaches studied disease Expression higher metastatic sites discordance primary metastatic sites patients suggests patient selection therapies based expression metastatic nephrectomy specimens,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[229, 250, 235, 529, 30, 112, 1575, 32, 486, 276, 114, 743, 10, 6, 223, 55, 1, 3, 12, 13100, 448, 2906, 3143, 14, 4, 31, 134, 796, 22, 2906, 3143, 14, 529, 611, 823, 3159, 31, 36, 47, 44, 85, 194, 4, 26, 34, 21, 2516, 246, 2774, 1101, 2036, 991, 796, 140, 2, 2086, 1002, 246, 6, 223, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 75, 8, 1156, 4130, 596, 4, 352, 21, 656, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 4, 465, 655, 86, 2, 113, 796, 623, 6, 423, 1827, 59, 338, 30, 633, 2906, 3143, 14, 10, 561, 570, 4, 8, 697, 1, 8195, 55, 4, 86, 796, 623, 10, 97, 142, 76, 2086, 295, 246, 19, 13, 488, 2, 142, 4, 885, 31, 826, 76, 1796, 796, 19, 13, 488, 55, 148, 4, 113, 623, 11, 142, 76, 4, 655, 86, 347, 19, 13, 11995, 2, 3, 816, 59, 3, 100, 633, 10, 1721, 20721, 27, 33, 19, 13, 1460, 1898, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 527, 4, 885, 31, 796, 844, 17, 2906, 3143, 14, 529, 611, 257, 40, 656, 4, 26, 34, 55, 16, 142, 4, 113, 633, 2, 5771, 59, 86, 2, 113, 633, 4, 476, 7, 844, 17, 69, 881, 9, 46, 235, 257, 40, 90, 23, 55, 4, 113, 1832, 76, 1738, 623]",1345.0,24970819,NY-ESO-1 potential immunotherapeutic target renal carcinoma,1,0.003389830508474576
Functional autoantibodies against SSX-2 and NY-ESO-1 in multiple myeloma patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2014-07-31,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the malignancy with the most frequent expression of the highly immunogenic cancer-testis antigens (CTA), and we have performed the first analysis of longitudinal expression, immunological properties, and fine specificity of CTA-specific antibody responses in MM. Frequency and characteristics of antibody responses against cancer-testis antigens MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, PRAME, and SSX-2 were analyzed using peripheral blood (N = 1094) and bone marrow (N = 200) plasma samples from 194 MM patients. We found that antibody responses against CTA were surprisingly rare, only 2.6 and 3.1 % of patients evidenced NY-ESO-1- and SSX-2-specific antibodies, respectively. NY-ESO-1-specific responses were observed during disease progression, while anti-SSX-2 antibodies appeared after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and persisted during clinical remission. We found that NY-ESO-1- and SSX-2-specific antibodies were both capable of activating complement and increasing CTA uptake by antigen-presenting cells. SSX-2-specific antibodies were restricted to IgG3, NY-ESO-1 responses to IgG1 and IgG3. Remarkably, NY-ESO-1-positive sera recognized various non-contiguous regions, while SSX-2-specific responses were directed against a single 6mer epitope, SSX-2(85-90). We conclude that primary autoantibodies against intracellular MM-specific tumor antigens SSX-2 and NY-ESO-1 are rare but functional.

Adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy and strategies to mitigate them.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2014-08-02,"Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is a key component of treatment for aggressive and advanced prostate cancer, but it has also been associated with adverse effects on bone, metabolic, cardiovascular, sexual, and cognitive health as well as body composition. To review the current literature on the adverse effects of ADT and strategies for ameliorating harm from ADT. The Medline database (through PubMed) was searched from inception to August 1, 2013, for studies documenting the side effects of ADT and for randomized and prospective trials of interventions to mitigate those side effects. Adverse effects of ADT include decreases in bone mineral density; metabolic changes such as weight gain, decreased muscle mass, and increased insulin resistance; decreased libido and sexual dysfunction; hot flashes; gynecomastia; reduced testicle size; anemia; and fatigue. Several observational studies suggest an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events, although most published studies report that ADT is not linked to greater cardiovascular mortality. Randomized trials have found value in treatments for some adverse effects including bone loss (bisphosphonates, denosumab, selective estrogen receptor modulators), markers of metabolic syndrome (exercise, diet, metformin), gynecomastia (tamoxifen, prophylactic radiation), muscle loss (resistance and aerobic exercise), and hot flashes (venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone, cyproterone acetate, gabapentin). ADT is often a necessary component of the treatment of aggressive prostate cancer, yet it has known harms that can impair health and quality of life. Clinicians should be aware of interventions that can help mitigate these adverse effects.

DLBCL was associated with B-cell activating autoimmune diseases (odds ratio [OR] = 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.80 to 3.09), hepatitis C virus seropositivity (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.47 to 2.76), family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.47), higher young adult body mass index (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.23, for 35+ vs 18.5 to 22.4 kg/m(2)), higher recreational sun exposure (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.89), any atopic disorder (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.76 to 0.89), and higher socioeconomic status (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.79 to 0.94).

Craniocaudal retroperitoneal node length as a risk factor for relapse from clinical stage I testicular germ cell tumor.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2014-10-01,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether retroperitoneal craniocaudal nodal length or nodal volume predicts relapse risk in stage I testicular cancer. We retrospectively reviewed 826 testicular cancer patients. Of these 826 patients, 118 had stage I disease and either less than 2 years of surveillance or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection with no adjuvant chemotherapy. These patients formed our analytic cohort, and 3D nodal volumes and craniocaudal nodal length were measured. Association between relapse risk and craniocaudal nodal length and nodal volume was evaluated using univariable or multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for known prognostic factors. Sixty-six (56%) of 118 patients had nonseminomatous germ cell tumor and 52 (44%) had seminomatous germ cell tumor. Craniocaudal nodal length proved to be an independent risk factor in nonseminomatous germ cell tumors using a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for other potential known risk factors of embryonal predominance and lymphovascular invasion. For every 3-mm increase in craniocaudal nodal length, the risk of relapse increased by 52% (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.25). For patients with seminomas, only primary tumor size was an independent risk factor for relapse (1.34, 1.02-1.75). In nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, craniocaudal nodal length was shown to be associated with increased risk of relapse independently of other known risk factors. If validated in an independent cohort, craniocaudal nodal length could provide important additional information to inform management decisions in these patients.",Journal Article,1938.0,6.0,purpose investigate retroperitoneal craniocaudal nodal length nodal volume predicts relapse risk stage testicular retrospectively reviewed 826 testicular patients 826 patients 118 stage disease 2 years surveillance retroperitoneal lymph node dissection adjuvant chemotherapy patients formed analytic cohort 3D nodal volumes craniocaudal nodal length measured Association relapse risk craniocaudal nodal length nodal volume evaluated univariable multivariable logistic regression models adjusted known prognostic factors Sixty-six 56 118 patients nonseminomatous germ 52 44 seminomatous germ Craniocaudal nodal length proved independent risk factor nonseminomatous germ multivariable logistic regression model adjusting potential known risk factors embryonal predominance lymphovascular invasion 3-mm increase craniocaudal nodal length risk relapse increased 52 odds ratio 1.52 95 CI 1.03-2.25 patients seminomas primary size independent risk factor relapse 1.34 1.02-1.75 nonseminomatous germ craniocaudal nodal length shown associated increased risk relapse independently known risk factors validated independent cohort craniocaudal nodal length provide important additional information inform management decisions patients,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 963, 317, 2591, 19456, 779, 1318, 15, 779, 433, 2623, 429, 43, 4, 82, 70, 12, 21, 894, 446, 11993, 12, 7, 1, 46, 11993, 7, 4002, 42, 82, 70, 34, 2, 361, 299, 76, 18, 60, 1, 617, 15, 2591, 263, 289, 1161, 5, 77, 249, 56, 46, 7, 3516, 114, 5146, 180, 2, 2265, 779, 2225, 2, 19456, 779, 1318, 11, 644, 248, 59, 429, 43, 2, 19456, 779, 1318, 2, 779, 433, 10, 194, 75, 4084, 15, 658, 812, 320, 274, 586, 9, 440, 177, 130, 1746, 437, 664, 1, 4002, 7, 42, 8052, 2280, 31, 30, 2, 653, 584, 42, 17816, 2280, 31, 30, 19456, 779, 1318, 4328, 6, 40, 35, 306, 43, 161, 4, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 75, 8, 658, 812, 320, 202, 1358, 9, 127, 174, 440, 43, 130, 1, 5239, 7593, 2, 2933, 578, 9, 454, 27, 321, 344, 4, 19456, 779, 1318, 3, 43, 1, 429, 101, 20, 653, 610, 197, 15, 14, 653, 48, 58, 14, 680, 18, 243, 9, 7, 5, 11092, 158, 86, 30, 444, 10, 35, 306, 43, 161, 9, 429, 14, 562, 14, 588, 14, 481, 4, 8052, 2280, 31, 57, 19456, 779, 1318, 10, 443, 6, 40, 41, 5, 101, 43, 1, 429, 1042, 1, 127, 440, 43, 130, 492, 938, 4, 35, 306, 180, 19456, 779, 1318, 359, 377, 305, 402, 487, 6, 2295, 284, 1526, 4, 46, 7]",1578.0,25247970,Craniocaudal retroperitoneal node length risk factor relapse clinical stage testicular germ,0,0.0
"Immunomodulatory action of SGI-110, a hypomethylating agent, in acute myeloid leukemia cells and xenografts.",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2014-09-10,"The mechanism of clinical action for the FDA approved hypomethylating drugs azacitidine and decitabine remains unresolved and in this context the potential immunomodulatory effect of these agents on leukemic cells is an area of active investigation. Induced expression of methylated Cancer Testis Antigen (CTA) genes has been demonstrated in leukemic cell lines following exposure to hypomethylating drugs in vitro. SGI-110 is a novel hypomethylating dinucleotide with prolonged in vivo exposure and clinical activity in patients with MDS and AML. We demonstrate that this agent, like decitabine, produces robust re-expression of the CTAs NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A, both in vitro and in leukemia-bearing AML xenografts. Upregulation of these genes in vitro was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity by HLA-compatible CD8+ T-cells specific for NY-ESO-1, a well-recognized and immunogenic CTA. Additionally, exposure to SGI-110 enhances MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecule expression, potentially contributing to recognition of CTAs. SGI-110, like the parent compound decitabine, induces expression of CTAs and might modulate immune recognition of myeloid malignancy.

We performed a large-scale immunohistochemical expression study of NY-ESO-1 using tissue microarrays of mesenchymal tumors from three institutions in an international collaboration. A total of 1132 intermediate and malignant and 175 benign mesenchymal lesions were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue microarrays using a monoclonal antibody for NY-ESO-1. Among mesenchymal tumors, myxoid liposarcomas showed the highest positivity for NY-ESO-1 (88%), followed by synovial sarcomas (49%), myxofibrosarcomas (35%), and conventional chondrosarcomas (28%). Positivity of NY-ESO-1 in the remaining mesenchymal tumors was consistently low, and no immunoreactivity was observed in benign mesenchymal lesions. On the basis of these findings, nearly 90% of myxoid liposarcomas, as well as a significant proportion of synovial sarcomas, myxofibrosarcomas, and conventional chondrosarcomas are good candidates for immunotherapy targeting NY-ESO-1.

"Personalised chemotherapy based on tumour marker decline in poor prognosis germ-cell tumours (GETUG 13): a phase 3, multicentre, randomised trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2014-11-13,"Poor prognosis germ-cell tumours are only cured in about half of patients. We aimed to assess whether treatment intensification based on an early tumour marker decline will improve progression-free survival for patients with germ-cell tumours. In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised trial, patients were enrolled from France (20 centres), USA (one centre), and Slovakia (one centre). Patients were eligible if they were older than 16 years, had evidence of testicular, retroperitoneal, or mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumours based on histological findings or clinical evidence and highly elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin or alfa-fetoprotein concentrations that matched International Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group poor prognosis criteria. After one cycle of BEP (intravenous cisplatin [20 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days], etoposide [100 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days], and intramuscular or intravenous bleomycin [30 mg per day on days 1, 8, and 15]), patients' human chorionic gonadotropin and alfa-fetoprotein concentrations were measured at day 18-21. Patients with a favourable decline in human chorionic gonadotropin and alfa-fetoprotein continued BEP (Fav-BEP group) for 3 additonal cycles, whereas patients with an unfavourable decline were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either BEP (Unfav-BEP group) or a dose-dense regimen (Unfav-dose-dense group), consisting of intravenous paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) over 3 h on day 1) before BEP plus intravenous oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) over 3 h on day 10; two cycles), followed by intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2) over 2 h on day 1), intravenous ifosfamide (2 g/m(2) over 3 h on days 10, 12, and 14), plus mesna (500 mg/m(2) at 0, 3, 7 and 11 h), and bleomycin (25 units per day, by continuous infusion for 5 days on days 10-14; two cycles), with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (lenograstim) support. Centrally blocked computer-generated randomisation stratified by centre was used. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and the efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. The planned trial accrual was completed in May, 2012, and follow-up is ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00104676. Between Nov 28, 2003, and May 16, 2012, 263 patients were enrolled and 254 were available for tumour marker assessment. Of these 51 (20%) had a favourable marker assessment, and 203 (80%) had an unfavourable tumour marker decline; 105 were randomly assigned to the Unfav-dose-dense group and 98 to the Unfav-BEP group. 3-year progression-free survival was 59% (95% CI 49-68) in the Unfav-dose-dense group versus 48% (38-59) in the Unfav-BEP group (HR 0·66, 95% CI 0·44-1·00, p=0·05). 3-year progression-free survival was 70% (95% CI 57-81) in the Fav-BEP group (HR 0·66, 95% CI 0·49-0·88, p=0·01 for progression-free survival compared with the Unfav-BEP group). More grade 3-4 neurotoxic events (seven [7%] vs one [1%]) and haematotoxic events occurred in the Unfav-dose-dense group compared with in the Unfav-BEP group; there was no difference in grade 1-2 febrile neutropenia (18 [17%] vs 18 [18%]) or toxic deaths (one [1%] in both groups). Salvage high-dose chemotherapy plus a stem-cell transplant was required in six (6%) patients in the Unfav-dose-dense group and 16 (16%) in the Unfav-BEP group. Personalised treatment with chemotherapy intensification reduces the risk of progression or death in patients with poor prognosis germ-cell tumours and an unfavourable tumour marker decline.

Potential for immunotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma.,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,Hum Vaccin Immunother,2014-01-01,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare, heterogeneous tumors of mesenchymal origin. Despite optimal treatment, a large proportion of patients will develop recurrent and metastatic disease. For these patients, current treatment options are quite limited. Significant progress has been made recently in the use of immunotherapy for the treatment of other solid tumors (e.g. prostate cancer, melanoma). There is a strong rationale for immunotherapy in STS, based on an understanding of disease biology. For example, STS frequently have chromosomal translocations which result in unique fusion proteins and specific subtypes have been shown to express cancer testis antigens. In this review, we discuss the current status of immunotherapy in STS, including data from human studies with cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade. Further research into STS immunology is needed to help design logical, subtype-specific immunotherapeutic strategies.

Immunomodulatory action of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor SGI-110 in epithelial ovarian cancer cells and xenografts.,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,2015-01-01,"We aimed to determine the effect of SGI-110 on methylation and expression of the cancer testis antigens (CTAs) NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in vitro and in vivo and to establish the impact of SGI-110 on expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on EOC cells, and on recognition of EOC cells by NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T-cells. We also tested the impact of combined SGI-110 and NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T-cells on tumor growth and/or murine survival in a xenograft setting. EOC cells were treated with SGI-110 in vitro at various concentrations and as tumor xenografts with 3 distinct dose schedules. Effects on global methylation (using LINE-1), NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A methylation, mRNA, and protein expression were determined and compared to controls. SGI-110 treated EOC cells were evaluated for expression of immune-modulatory genes using flow cytometry, and were co-cultured with NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell clones to determine immune recognition. In vivo administration of SGI-110 and CD8+ T-cells was performed to determine anti-tumor effects on EOC xenografts. SGI-110 treatment induced hypomethylation and CTA gene expression in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, at levels generally superior to azacitidine or decitabine.

Testicular GCTs constitute the most common solid tumor in men between the ages of 20 and 34 years, and the incidence of testicular GCTs has been increasing in the past 2 decades. Testicular GCTs are classified into 2 broad groups--pure seminoma and nonseminoma--which are treated differently. Pure seminomas, unlike nonseminomas, are more likely to be localized to the testis at presentation. Nonseminoma is the more clinically aggressive tumor associated with elevated serum concentrations of alphafetoprotein (AFP). The diagnosis of a seminoma is restricted to pure seminoma histology and a normal serum concentration of AFP. When both seminoma and elements of a nonseminoma are present, management follows that for a nonseminoma.

Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive MM received an average 2.4 × 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded, persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 19.1 months.

Long-term outcomes of helper peptide vaccination for metastatic melanoma.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2015-09-01,"The objective of this study was to compare the long-term outcome of patients with metastatic melanoma vaccinated with 6MHP to that of a group of unvaccinated historical controls. A multipeptide vaccine (6MHP), designed to induce helper T cells against melanocytic and cancer-testis antigens, has been shown to induce specific Th1-dominant CD4+ T cell responses. The 6MHP vaccine was administered to patients with metastatic melanoma. Circulating CD4+ T cell responses were measured by proliferation or direct IFN-gamma ELIspot assay. Overall survival of vaccinated patients was compared to a group of clinically comparable historical controls using multivariable Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, taking into account age, metastatic site, and resection status. Across 40 vaccinated patients and 87 controls, resection status (HR 0.54, P = 0.004) and vaccination (HR 0.24, P < 0.001) were associated with improved overall survival. Forty pairs of vaccinated patients and controls were matched by metastatic site, resection status, and age within 10 years. Median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients (5.4 vs 1.3 years, P < 0.001).

Gynecol. Pathol.,2016-03-01,"We report our experience with prostatic-type tissue in ovarian teratomas, and in particular we highlight a case of prostatic-type adenocarcinoma arising within a mature cystic ovarian teratoma in a 32-yr-old woman. On gross examination, the cyst consisted of typical features of a dermoid cyst. Closer examination revealed a single 1.5-cm solid nodule within the cyst. Microscopically, it was composed of a small cyst-like structure lined by urothelium and to one side glandular and stromal tissue consistent with prostate parenchyma. Within the prostatic-type tissue, there were malignant glands morphologically and immunohistochemically supportive of prostatic-type adenocarcinoma Gleason score 3+3=6. There were also areas consistent with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Although there are several reports in the literature of benign prostatic-type tissue arising within ovarian as well as testicular teratomas, to our knowledge, prostatic-type adenocarcinoma arising in a mature ovarian teratoma is an extremely rare phenomenon, with only 1 previous report in the literature.

Relationship Between the Pathologic Subtype/Initial Stage and Microliths in Testicular Germ Cell Tumors.,Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,J Ultrasound Med,2015-09-22,"To investigate the relationship between microliths and germ cell tumor histologic subtypes and determine whether microliths correlate with tumor stage at diagnosis. A total of 1249 patients with testicular cancer seen between 1999 and 2013 were evaluated; 346 of 1249 patients (28%) with primary testicular tumors and sonographic imaging of unaffected testicular tissue formed the analytic cohort. Age, ethnicity, tumor histologic subtype, and stage at diagnosis were extracted from the medical record. Two examiners concurrently recorded the highest number of microliths per image of unaffected testicular tissue. A total of 175 of 346 patients (51%) had 1 or more microliths; 69 of 346 (20%) had more than 5 microliths per image. The histologic percentage of seminomas positively correlated with the microlith count (rs = 0.12; P = .036); the histologic percentage of embryonal components negatively correlated with the microlith count (rs = -0.15; P = .007). A higher microlith count was associated with a lower stage at diagnosis (P = .0243). Subgroup analysis of pure seminomas suggested a trend toward a higher microlith count in patients with lower-stage disease at diagnosis (P= .07). No association was found between the tumor stage at diagnosis and microlith count in patients with greater than 50% embryonal components of tumors (P= .55). No association was found between microliths and age, tumor size, and presence of lymphovascular/rete testis invasion (P = .120, .500, .629, and .155, respectively). Patients with testicular cancer who have microliths may be more likely to have a higher percentage of seminomas and a lower percentage of embryonal components in their primary tumors.

Increased risk of second malignant neoplasms in adolescents and young adults with cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-10-06,"The authors describe the incidence and characteristics of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors compared with those in younger and older cancer survivors. Children aged ≤ 14 years, AYAs aged 15 to 39, and older adults aged ≥ 40 years at the time of primary diagnosis who were reported as cancer survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2011 were compared in this population-based analysis. The primary analysis was the risk that an SMN would occur ≥ 5 years after the original diagnosis for patients who had the more common AYA cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, testicular malignancy, ovarian malignancy, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, breast, soft tissue, or bone). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative incidence of SMN for the selected cancers were assessed. The risk of SMN for the entire cohort also was analyzed. Of the 148,558 AYA survivors who were diagnosed with a selected cancer, 7384 developed an SMN 5 years after their original diagnosis. The SIRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.55-1.62) for AYAs, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.77-4.80) for children, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09-1.11) for older adults, and the AERs were 22.9, 16.6, and 14.7, respectively. The cumulative incidence of SMN at 30 years was 13.9% for the AYA group. The most common SMNs in AYAs were breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genital cancers, and melanoma. AYAs who had received radiation therapy had a higher cumulative incidence of SMN.

Cancer-testis antigen MAGEC2 promotes proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in Multiple Myeloma.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2015-10-12,"Cancer-testis antigens belonging to the MAGE family of genes, such as MAGEC2, are commonly and specifically expressed in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and are associated with a more aggressive clinical course and chemotherapy resistance. MAGEC2 is thought to be an excellent candidate for cancer immunotherapy; however, the biological role of MAGEC2 in MM has remained unclear. We investigated the biological role of MAGEC2 in myeloma cells determining the effect of MAGEC2 knockdown on proliferation and apoptosis. Loss of MAGEC2 resulted in reduced proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent growth of myeloma cells irrespective of the functional status of TP53 (p53). The anti-proliferative effect of MAGEC2 silencing was due to a decrease of cells in the S phase, cell cycle delay at both G0/G1 and/or G2/M, and an increase in the sub-G0/G1 diploid population related to apoptotic cell death.

Analysis of Heritability and Shared Heritability Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies for Thirteen Cancer Types.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-10-12,"Studies of related individuals have consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation of cancer. We aim to estimate the heritability and genetic correlation attributable to the additive effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cancer at 13 anatomical sites. Between 2007 and 2014, the US National Cancer Institute has generated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 49 492 cancer case patients and 34 131 control patients. We apply novel mixed model methodology (GCTA) to this GWAS data to estimate the heritability of individual cancers, as well as the proportion of heritability attributable to cigarette smoking in smoking-related cancers, and the genetic correlation between pairs of cancers. GWAS heritability was statistically significant at nearly all sites, with the estimates of array-based heritability, hl (2), on the liability threshold (LT) scale ranging from 0.05 to 0.38. Estimating the combined heritability of multiple smoking characteristics, we calculate that at least 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14% to 37%) and 7% (95% CI = 4% to 11%) of the heritability for lung and bladder cancer, respectively, can be attributed to genetic determinants of smoking. Most pairs of cancers studied did not show evidence of strong genetic correlation. We found only four pairs of cancers with marginally statistically significant correlations, specifically kidney and testes (ρ = 0.73, SE = 0.28), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and pediatric osteosarcoma (ρ = 0.53, SE = 0.21), DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (ρ = 0.51, SE =0.18), and bladder and lung (ρ = 0.35, SE = 0.14). Correlation analysis also indicates that the genetic architecture of lung cancer differs between a smoking population of European ancestry and a nonsmoking Asian population, allowing for the possibility that the genetic etiology for the same disease can vary by population and environmental exposures. Our results provide important insights into the genetic architecture of cancers and suggest new avenues for investigation.",Journal Article,1562.0,68.0,Studies related individuals consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation aim estimate heritability genetic correlation attributable additive effects common single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs 13 anatomical sites 2007 2014 National Institute generated genome-wide association studies GWAS 49 492 case patients 34 131 control patients apply novel mixed model methodology GCTA GWAS estimate heritability individual proportion heritability attributable cigarette smoking smoking-related genetic correlation pairs GWAS heritability statistically significant nearly sites estimates array-based heritability hl 2 liability threshold LT scale ranging 0.05 0.38 Estimating combined heritability multiple smoking characteristics calculate 24 95 confidence interval CI 14 37 7 95 CI 4 11 heritability lung bladder respectively attributed genetic determinants smoking pairs studied evidence strong genetic correlation pairs marginally statistically significant correlations specifically kidney testes ρ 0.73 SE 0.28 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma DLBCL pediatric osteosarcoma ρ 0.53 SE 0.21 DLBCL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL ρ 0.51 SE =0.18 bladder lung ρ 0.35 SE 0.14 Correlation indicates genetic architecture lung differs smoking population European ancestry nonsmoking Asian population allowing possibility genetic etiology disease vary population environmental exposures provide important insights genetic architecture suggest new avenues investigation,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[94, 1, 139, 869, 47, 2433, 264, 4090, 2200, 6598, 1, 12, 21, 1130, 6, 1191, 3, 13160, 2, 336, 816, 2971, 6, 3, 3396, 176, 1, 186, 226, 1579, 1203, 1109, 9, 12, 28, 233, 5024, 633, 59, 1307, 2, 1409, 3, 843, 657, 12, 1377, 71, 1419, 74, 29, 898, 1019, 248, 94, 3297, 9, 739, 11628, 12, 473, 7, 2, 562, 2229, 182, 7, 21, 4930, 229, 1739, 202, 3209, 66961, 6, 26, 3297, 74, 6, 1191, 3, 13160, 1, 797, 163, 22, 149, 22, 3, 920, 1, 13160, 2971, 6, 4870, 979, 4, 979, 139, 163, 2, 3, 336, 816, 59, 2773, 1, 163, 3297, 13160, 10, 712, 93, 28, 1857, 62, 633, 5, 3, 1423, 1, 1926, 90, 13160, 1718, 18, 23, 3, 24602, 2390, 4980, 1124, 2223, 29, 13, 474, 6, 13, 519, 4563, 3, 397, 13160, 1, 232, 979, 374, 21, 3232, 17, 28, 506, 259, 48, 307, 268, 58, 213, 6, 567, 2, 67, 48, 58, 39, 6, 175, 1, 3, 13160, 9, 2, 12, 106, 122, 40, 3073, 6, 336, 3403, 1, 979, 96, 2773, 1, 163, 656, 205, 44, 514, 241, 1, 1082, 336, 816, 21, 204, 158, 294, 2773, 1, 163, 5, 5007, 712, 93, 2553, 1225, 2, 13100, 7128, 13, 803, 3428, 13, 339, 1388, 375, 132, 31, 1446, 2, 815, 7128, 13, 699, 3428, 13, 239, 1446, 2, 442, 1193, 552, 7128, 13, 725, 3428, 13, 203, 2, 2, 7128, 13, 465, 3428, 13, 213, 816, 65, 120, 2640, 17, 3, 336, 4447, 1, 12, 4990, 59, 8, 979, 266, 1, 1865, 3535, 2, 8, 20378, 2399, 266, 2952, 9, 3, 2526, 17, 3, 336, 2855, 9, 3, 827, 34, 122, 2825, 20, 266, 2, 3766, 3401, 114, 99, 377, 305, 1957, 237, 3, 336, 4447, 1, 163, 2, 309, 217, 6612, 9, 940]",1922.0,26464424,Heritability Shared Heritability Based Genome-Wide Association Studies Thirteen Types,0,0.0
Mutational Profiling Can Establish Clonal or Independent Origin in Synchronous Bilateral Breast and Other Tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-11-10,"Synchronous tumors can be independent primary tumors or a primary-metastatic (clonal) pair, which may have clinical implications. Mutational profiling of tumor DNA is increasingly common in the clinic. We investigated whether mutational profiling can distinguish independent from clonal tumors in breast and other cancers, using a carefully defined test based on the Clonal Likelihood Score (CLS = 100 x # shared high confidence (HC) mutations/ # total HC mutations). Statistical properties of a formal test using the CLS were investigated. A high CLS is evidence in favor of clonality; the test is implemented as a one-sided binomial test of proportions. Test parameters were empirically determined using 16,422 independent breast tumor pairs and 15 primary-metastatic tumor pairs from 10 cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas. We validated performance of the test with its established parameters, using five published data sets comprising 15,758 known independent tumor pairs (maximum CLS = 4.1%, minimum p-value = 0.48) and 283 known tumor clonal pairs (minimum CLS 13%, maximum p-value <0.01), across renal cell, testicular, and colorectal cancer. The CLS test correctly classified all validation samples but one, which it appears may have been incorrectly classified in the published data. As proof-of-concept we then applied the CLS test to two new cases of invasive synchronous bilateral breast cancer at our institution, each with one hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+/HER2-) lobular and one triple negative ductal carcinoma. High confidence mutations were identified by exome sequencing and results were validated using deep targeted sequencing. The first tumor pair had CLS of 81% (p-value < 10-15), supporting clonality. In the second pair, no common mutations of 184 variants were validated (p-value >0.99), supporting independence. A plausible molecular mechanism for the shift from hormone receptor positive to triple negative was identified in the clonal pair. We have developed the statistical properties of a carefully defined Clonal Likelihood Score test from mutational profiling of tumor DNA. Under identified conditions, the test appears to reliably distinguish between synchronous tumors of clonal and of independent origin in several cancer types. This approach may have scientific and clinical utility.",Journal Article,1533.0,8.0,"Synchronous independent primary primary-metastatic clonal pair clinical implications profiling DNA increasingly common clinic investigated profiling distinguish independent clonal breast carefully defined test based Clonal Likelihood Score CLS 100 x shared high confidence HC mutations/ total HC Statistical properties formal test CLS investigated high CLS evidence favor clonality test implemented one-sided binomial test proportions Test parameters empirically determined 16,422 independent breast pairs 15 primary-metastatic pairs 10 types Genome Atlas validated performance test established parameters published sets comprising 15,758 known independent pairs maximum CLS 4.1 minimum p-value 0.48 283 known clonal pairs minimum CLS 13 maximum p-value 0.01 renal testicular colorectal CLS test correctly classified validation appears incorrectly classified published proof-of-concept applied CLS test new cases invasive synchronous bilateral breast institution hormone receptor positive ER+/PR+/HER2- lobular triple negative ductal carcinoma High confidence identified exome sequencing validated deep targeted sequencing pair CLS 81 p-value 10-15 supporting clonality second pair common 184 validated p-value 0.99 supporting independence plausible molecular mechanism shift hormone receptor positive triple negative identified clonal pair developed statistical properties carefully defined Clonal Likelihood Score test profiling DNA identified conditions test appears reliably distinguish synchronous clonal independent origin types approach scientific clinical utility",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2734, 57, 122, 40, 306, 86, 57, 15, 8, 86, 113, 1946, 4767, 92, 68, 47, 38, 1268, 1619, 1080, 1, 30, 261, 16, 1635, 186, 4, 3, 1188, 21, 565, 317, 1619, 1080, 122, 3081, 306, 29, 1946, 57, 4, 2, 127, 163, 75, 8, 3900, 395, 412, 90, 23, 3, 1946, 1420, 368, 9610, 394, 1006, 2664, 64, 307, 7487, 138, 181, 7487, 138, 1050, 1571, 1, 8, 5057, 412, 75, 3, 9610, 11, 565, 8, 64, 9610, 16, 241, 4, 4283, 1, 8905, 3, 412, 16, 3426, 22, 8, 104, 1689, 8538, 412, 1, 4117, 412, 1038, 11, 9654, 509, 75, 245, 10581, 306, 30, 2773, 2, 167, 86, 113, 30, 2773, 29, 79, 12, 630, 75, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 21, 938, 528, 1, 3, 412, 5, 211, 635, 1038, 75, 365, 983, 74, 2270, 3538, 167, 13235, 440, 306, 30, 2773, 689, 9610, 39, 14, 2499, 19, 549, 13, 576, 2, 9078, 440, 30, 1946, 2773, 2499, 9610, 233, 689, 19, 549, 13, 355, 716, 31, 2, 12, 3, 9610, 412, 4911, 1373, 62, 929, 347, 84, 104, 92, 192, 1233, 68, 47, 85, 16654, 1373, 4, 3, 983, 74, 22, 3840, 1, 2545, 21, 818, 1498, 3, 9610, 412, 6, 100, 217, 140, 1, 416, 2734, 1607, 12, 28, 114, 731, 296, 5, 104, 785, 153, 109, 516, 998, 354, 3016, 2, 104, 1500, 199, 1258, 134, 64, 307, 138, 11, 108, 20, 2865, 615, 2, 99, 11, 938, 75, 2369, 238, 615, 3, 157, 30, 4767, 42, 9610, 1, 865, 19, 549, 79, 167, 1912, 8905, 4, 3, 419, 4767, 77, 186, 138, 1, 5894, 839, 11, 938, 19, 549, 13, 1058, 1912, 5773, 8, 7761, 219, 670, 9, 3, 3024, 29, 785, 153, 109, 6, 1500, 199, 10, 108, 4, 3, 1946, 4767, 21, 47, 276, 3, 1050, 1571, 1, 8, 3900, 395, 1946, 1420, 368, 412, 29, 1619, 1080, 1, 30, 261, 669, 108, 1298, 3, 412, 1233, 6, 4092, 3081, 59, 2734, 57, 1, 1946, 2, 1, 306, 1938, 4, 392, 12, 630, 26, 353, 68, 47, 3138, 2, 38, 1207]",2219.0,26554380,Profiling Establish Clonal Independent Origin Synchronous Bilateral Breast,0,0.0

Genetic Effect of Chemotherapy Exposure in Children of Testicular Cancer Survivors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-12-02,"Cancer survivors express anxiety that chemotherapy exposure may lead to transmissible genetic damage in posttreatment children. Preclinical models suggest that chemotherapy exposure may result in considerable genomic alterations in postexposure progeny. Epidemiologic studies have not demonstrated a significant increase in congenital abnormalities in posttreatment children of cancer survivors, but the inherited genome-wide effect of chemotherapy exposure in humans is unknown. Two testicular cancer survivors cured with chemotherapy who had children pre- and postexposure without sperm banking were identified. Familial germline whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for these families, and analytic methods were utilized to identify de novo alterations, including mutations, recombinations, and structural rearrangements in the pre- and postexposure offspring. No increase in de novo germline mutations in postexposure children compared with their preexposure siblings was found. Furthermore, there were no increased short insertion/deletions, recombination frequency, or structural rearrangements in these postexposure children. In two families of male cancer survivors, there was no transmissible genomic impact of significant mutagenic exposure in postexposure children.

A computed tomography scan of the neck performed 30 days before referral revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 × 5 cm). A fine-needle aspirate of nasopharyngeal tissue demonstrated fibroadipose tissue. Tissue collected by core needle biopsy of a left internal jugular lymph node demonstrated a reactive lymph node but no malignancy. The patient was admitted to an academic medical center hospital. His physical examination was remarkable for bulky cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A testicular examination was normal. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 327 U/L (normal range, 118-225 U/L). A positron emission tomography scan revealed bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (6 × 5 cm with a standardized uptake value [SUV] of 14), a 1.3-cm subcutaneous nodule in the left thigh (SUV 16), and two 2.7-cm liver lesions (SUV 14). He underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node revealed effacement of the architecture by an interfollicular infiltrate of lymphoid cells (Fig 1). Mitotic figures were abundant (Ki-67 stain 80% to 90% positive) and there were multiple foci of tissue necrosis. The lymphoblasts were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and expressed the T-cell markers CD2, CD3, CD4, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. A subpopulation of T cells was positive for both CD4 and CD8. Polymerase chain reaction studies revealed a clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor γ gene.

Targetable genetic features of primary testicular and primary central nervous system lymphomas.,Blood,Blood,2015-12-23,"Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) and primary testicular lymphomas (PTLs) are extranodal large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs) with inferior responses to current empiric treatment regimens. To identify targetable genetic features of PCNSL and PTL, we characterized their recurrent somatic mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, copy number alterations (CNAs), and associated driver genes, and compared these comprehensive genetic signatures to those of diffuse LBCL and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). These studies identify unique combinations of genetic alterations in discrete LBCL subtypes and subtype-selective bases for targeted therapy. PCNSLs and PTLs frequently exhibit genomic instability, and near-uniform, often biallelic, CDKN2A loss with rare TP53 mutations. PCNSLs and PTLs also use multiple genetic mechanisms to target key genes and pathways and exhibit near-uniform oncogenic Toll-like receptor signaling as a result of MYD88 mutation and/or NFKBIZ amplification, frequent concurrent B-cell receptor pathway activation, and deregulation of BCL6. Of great interest, PCNSLs and PTLs also have frequent 9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2 CNAs and additional translocations of these loci, structural bases of immune evasion that are shared with PMBL.

Conditional Survival of Patients With Metastatic Testicular Germ Cell Tumors Treated With First-Line Curative Therapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-01-19,"The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) criteria prognosticate survival outcomes in metastatic testicular germ cell tumor (MT-GCT), but how the initial risk changes over time for those who survived since curative treatment is unknown. We assessed patients eligible for first-line therapy for MT-GCT at five tertiary cancer centers from 1990 to 2012 for 2-year conditional overall survival (COS) and conditional disease-free survival (CDFS), defined as the probability of surviving, or surviving and being disease free, respectively, for an additional 2 years at a given time point since the initial diagnosis. For all patients (N = 942), 2-year COS increased from 92% (95% CI, 91% to 94%) at 0 months to 98% (95% CI, 97% to 99%), and 2-year CDFS increased from 83% (95% CI, 81% to 86%) at baseline to 98% (95% CI, 97% to 99%) at 24 months after diagnosis. Two-year COS improved by 2% (97% at 0 months, 99% at 24 months) in the IGCCCG favorable-risk group, by 5% (94% at 0 months, 99% at 24 months) in the intermediate-risk group, and by 22% (71% at 0 months to 93% at 24 months) in the poor-risk group. Two-year CDFS improved significantly at 12 months for each risk group (favorable, 91% baseline v 95% at 12 months; intermediate, 84% v 95%; poor, 55% v 85%). Baseline IGCCCG risk stratification was not associated with long-term COS or CDFS for patients who survived to greater than 2 years post therapy. No significant differences in COS and CDFS were noted between seminoma and nonseminoma; patients ≥ 40 years old had inferior 2-year COS from 0 to 12 months, but no differences were noted at 18 months. Our data suggest that the concept of conditional survival applies to patients with MT-GCT treated with curative therapy.

The estimated cumulative incidence of testicular relapse among boys was elevated (13 ± 7.2%) compared to the rate observed on contemporary protocols. We conclude that post-induction therapy using intensive oral antimetabolites for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can result in overall long-term DFS comparable to that observed among children treated with regimens including intravenous MTX.

Induction of cancer testis antigen expression in circulating acute myeloid leukemia blasts following hypomethylating agent monotherapy.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-03-01,"Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are promising cancer associated antigens in solid tumors, but in acute myeloid leukemia, dense promoter methylation silences their expression. Leukemia cell lines exposed to HMAs induce expression of CTAs. We hypothesized that AML patients treated with standard of care decitabine (20mg/m2 per day for 10 days) would demonstrate induced expression of CTAs. Peripheral blood blasts serially isolated from AML patients treated with decitabine were evaluated for CTA gene expression and demethylation. Induction of NY-ESO-1 and MAGEA3/A6, were observed following decitabine. Re-expression of NY-ESO-1 and MAGEA3/A6 was associated with both promoter specific and global (LINE-1) hypomethylation. NY-ESO-1 and MAGEA3/A6 mRNA levels were increased irrespective of clinical response, suggesting that these antigens might be applicable even in patients who are not responsive to HMA therapy. Circulating blasts harvested after decitabine demonstrate induced NY-ESO-1 expression sufficient to activate NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ T-cells.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has identified AYA cancer patients as a unique population. The most common cancers in this age group include tumors typically seen in pediatric patients such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and brain tumors, as well as cancers more typically seen in adult patients such as breast cancer and melanoma. In addition, some cancers have their highest incidence in AYA patients, such as Hodgkin Lymphoma, testicular cancer, and bone tumors. AYA patients face additional unique issues due to their age, not just questions about treatment choices due to lack of data but also questions about fertility, relationships, loss of autonomy, and interruptions in school/work with potentially significant financial complications. This age group also has very high rates of social media usage with up to 90 % of adults aged 18 to 29 using social networking sites.

Combining Epigenetic and Immunotherapy to Combat Cancer.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2016-03-17,"The most exciting recent advance for achieving durable management of advanced human cancers is immunotherapy, especially the concept of immune checkpoint blockade. However, with the exception of melanoma, most patients do not respond to immunotherapy alone. A growing body of work has shown that epigenetic drugs, specifically DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can upregulate immune signaling in epithelial cancer cells through demethylation of endogenous retroviruses and cancer testis antigens. These demethylating agents may induce T-cell attraction and enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in mouse models.

Intratumoral heterogeneity: Role of differentiation in a potentially lethal phenotype of testicular cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-03-28,"Intratumoral heterogeneity presents a major obstacle to the widespread implementation of precision medicine. The authors assessed the origin of intratumoral heterogeneity in nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis (NSGCT) and identified distinct tumor subtypes and a potentially lethal phenotype. In this retrospective study, all consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with an NSGCT between January 2000 and December 2010 were evaluated. The histologic makeup of primary tumors and the clinical course of disease were determined for each patient. A Fine and Gray proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic risk factors, and the Gray test was used to detect differences in the cumulative incidence of cancer death. In a separate prospective study, next-generation sequencing was performed on tumor samples from 9 patients to identify any actionable mutations. Six hundred fifteen patients were included in this study. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of yolk sac tumor in the primary tumor (P = .0003) was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. NSGCT could be divided into 5 subgroups. Patients in the yolk sac-seminoma subgroup had the poorest clinical outcome (P = .0015). These tumors tended to undergo somatic transformation (P < .0001). Among the 9 NSGCTs that had a yolk sac tumor phenotype, no consistent gene mutation was detected. The current data suggest that intratumoral heterogeneity is caused in part by differentiation of pluripotent progenitor cells. Integrated or multimodal therapy may be effective at addressing intratumoral heterogeneity and treating distinct subtypes as well as a potentially lethal phenotype of NSGCT.

Cancer and Fertility Program Improves Patient Satisfaction With Information Received.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-04-04,"A cancer and fertility program was established at a large cancer center to support clinicians in discussing treatment-related fertility risks and fertility preservation (FP) options with patients and in referring patients to reproductive specialists. The program provides resources, clinician education, and fertility clinical nurse specialist consultation. This study evaluated the program's impact on patient satisfaction with information received. Retrospective cross-sectional surveys assessed satisfaction before (cohort 1 [C1]) and after (cohort 2 [C2]) program initiation. Questionnaires were investigator-designed, gender-specific, and anonymous. Most C1 (150 males, 271 females) and C2 (120 males, 320 females) respondents were 2 years postdiagnosis; the most frequently reported cancers were testicular, breast, and lymphoma. A significant difference in satisfaction with the amount of information received was seen between C1 and C2. For males, satisfaction with information on fertility risks was high in both cohorts but significantly greater in C2 for information on sperm banking (χ(2) = 9.3, P = .01) and finding a sperm bank (χ(2) = 13.3, P = .001). For females, satisfaction with information was significantly greater in C2 for information on fertility risks (χ(2) = 62.1, P < .001), FP options (χ(2) = 71.9, P < .001), help with decision making (χ(2) = 80.2, P < .001), and finding a reproductive endocrinologist (χ(2) = 60.5, P < .001).

Late effects resulting from cancer and cancer therapy are being characterized, but little information exists on sexual health for men who have survived childhood cancer. To assess erectile dysfunction (ED) in men who survived childhood and adolescent cancers and to identify potential risk factors for ED. In total, 1,622 men and 271 eligible brothers in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort completed the Male Health Questionnaire, which provided information on sexual practices and sexual function. Combined with demographic, cancer, and treatment information from medical record abstraction, results of the Male Health Questionnaire were analyzed using multivariable modeling. The International Index of Erectile Function was used to identify ED in subjects. International Index of Erectile Function. Survivors (mean age = 37.4 years, SD = 7.3 years) reported significantly lower sexual activity in the year before the survey than the brothers (mean age = 38.8 years, SD = 8.5 years) without cancer.

Following institutional review board approval, data on 2186 patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) at MSKCC between 1989 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these 2186 patients, we analyzed data for 44 patients (2%) who underwent PLND at the time of RPLND. PLND was performed in 14/44 (31%) patients at time of primary RPLND (P-RPLND), and in 21/44(48%) patients at time of postchemotherapy RPLND (PC-RPLND), usually for suspicious radiologic or intraoperative findings, whereas 9/44 (21%) underwent PLND for treatment of relapse. Positive pelvic findings on imaging included pelvic disease ≤5 cm in 17/44 (39%) patients and >5 cm in 11/44 (25%) patients (median size = 4 cm). At the time of PC-RPLND, alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin were elevated in 6/21 (29%) and 4/21 (19%) patients, respectively. Histology revealed teratoma in 15/44 (34%) and viable tumor in 5/44 (11%) patients. At a median follow-up of 46 months, 40/44 (91%) patients were living without disease, 3/44 (7%) were living with disease (1 after PC-RPLND and 2 after relapse), and 1/44 (2%) died of other causes.

Landscape of tumor-infiltrating T cell repertoire of human cancers.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-05-30,"We developed a computational method to infer the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences of tumor-infiltrating T cells in 9,142 RNA-seq samples across 29 cancer types. We identified over 600,000 CDR3 sequences, including 15% that were full length. CDR3 sequence length distribution and amino acid conservation, as well as variable gene usage, for infiltrating T cells in many tumors, except in brain and kidney cancers, resembled those for peripheral blood cells from healthy donors. We observed a strong association between T cell diversity and tumor mutation load, and we predicted SPAG5 and TSSK6 as putative immunogenic cancer/testis antigens in multiple cancers. Finally, we identified three potential immunogenic somatic mutations on the basis of their co-occurrence with CDR3 sequences. One of them, a PRAMEF4 mutation encoding p.Phe300Val, was predicted to result in peptide binding strongly to both MHC class I and class II molecules, with matched HLA types in its carriers.

Clin. Oncol.,2016-07-05,"The development of endocrinopathies in survivors of childhood cancer as they age remains understudied. We characterized endocrine outcomes in aging survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study on the basis of therapeutic exposures. We analyzed self-reported conditions in 14,290 5-year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, with a median age 6 years (range, < 1 to 20 years) at diagnosis and 32 years (range, 5 to 58 years) at last follow-up. Identification of high-risk therapeutic exposures was adopted from the Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines. Cumulative incidence curves and prevalence estimates quantified and regression models compared risks of primary hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid neoplasms, hypopituitarism, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or gonadal dysfunction between survivors and siblings. The cumulative incidence and prevalence of endocrine abnormalities increased across the lifespan of survivors (P < .01 for all). Risk was significantly higher in survivors exposed to high-risk therapies compared with survivors not so exposed for primary hypothyroidism (hazard ratio [HR], 6.6; 95% CI, 5.6 to 7.8), hyperthyroidism (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8), thyroid nodules (HR, 6.3; 95% CI, 5.2 to 7.5), thyroid cancer (HR, 9.2; 95% CI, 6.2 to 13.7), growth hormone deficiency (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 4.3 to 6.4), obesity (relative risk, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0), and diabetes mellitus (relative risk, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.4). Women exposed to high-risk therapies had six-fold increased risk for premature ovarian insufficiency (P < .001), and men demonstrated higher prevalence of testosterone replacement (P < .001) after cyclophosphamide equivalent dose of 20 g/m(2) or greater or testicular irradiation with 20 Gy or greater.

CT restaging of testicular germ cell tumors: The incidence of isolated pelvic metastases.,European journal of radiology,Eur J Radiol,2016-06-04,"We determined the incidence of isolated pelvic metastases at restaging computed tomography (CT) in patients with testicular germ cell tumors to consider if imaging the pelvis could be omitted. After receiving IRB approval for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, medical records of 560 men (mean age 32.8) with 583 testicular germ cell tumors who underwent 3683 restaging CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were reviewed to determine the proportion of patients with metastatic disease in the pelvis alone, as verified by histology or by resolution after therapy. Chi-square statistical analysis tested the association between factors currently thought to predispose patients to pelvic metastases. Patients were also categorized by clinical stage, tumor histology, and initial treatment. Isolated pelvic metastases were detected in nine (1.6%) of 560 men. Neither bulky abdominal disease (p=0.85) nor extratesticular invasion by the primary tumor (p=0.37) were statistically significant in predicting which patients were more likely to have isolated pelvic metastases. Among the nine patients with isolated pelvic recurrence, only three (0.7%) of 408 men with no known pelvic disease at initial staging and no tumor marker elevation at restaging had isolated pelvic metastases. Isolated pelvic recurrence was not statistically different when analyzed by initial stage and treatment. The incidence of isolated pelvic metastases in testicular germ cell tumors at restaging CT is low, but no group of patients was found to be without risk.

"Insurance status and disparities in disease presentation, treatment, and outcomes for men with germ cell tumors.",Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-08,"People aged 26 to 34 years represent the greatest proportion of the uninsured, and they have the highest incidence of testicular cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between insurance status and cancer outcomes in men diagnosed with germ cell tumors. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify 10,211 men diagnosed with germ cell gonadal neoplasms from 2007 to 2011. Associations between insurance status and characteristics at diagnosis and receipt of treatment were examined with log-binomial regression. The association between insurance status and mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression. Uninsured patients had an increased risk of metastatic disease at diagnosis (relative risk [RR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.38) in comparison with insured patients, as did Medicaid patients (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.51-1.74). Among men with metastatic disease, uninsured and Medicaid patients were more likely to be diagnosed with intermediate/poor-risk disease (RR for uninsured patients, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.44; RR for Medicaid patients, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.23-1.57) and were less likely to undergo lymph node dissection (RR for uninsured patients, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; RR for Medicaid patients, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) in comparison with insured patients. Men without insurance were more likely to die of their disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.29-2.75) in comparison with insured men, as were those with Medicaid (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.08-2.10).

Intensive treatment and survival outcomes in NUT midline carcinoma of the head and neck.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-08-10,"NUT midline carcinoma is a rare and aggressive genetically characterized subtype of squamous cell carcinoma frequently arising from the head and neck. The characteristics and optimal management of head and neck NUT midline carcinoma (HNNMC) are unclear. A retrospective review of all known cases of HNNMC in the International NUT Midline Carcinoma Registry as of December 31, 2014, was performed. Forty-eight consecutive patients were treated from 1993 to 2014, and clinicopathologic variables and outcomes for 40 patients were available for analyses; they composed the largest HNNMC cohort studied to date. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) according to patient characteristics and treatment were analyzed. This study identified a 5-fold increase in the diagnosis of HNNMC from 2011 to 2014. The median age was 21.9 years (range, 0.1-81.7 years); the male and female proportions were 40% and 60%, respectively; and 86% had bromodomain containing 4-nuclear protein in testis (BRD4-NUT) fusion. The initial treatment was initial surgery with or without adjuvant chemoradiation or adjuvant radiation (56%), initial radiation with or without chemotherapy (15%), or initial chemotherapy with or without surgery or radiation (28%). The median PFS was 6.6 months (range, 4.7-8.4 months). The median OS was 9.7 months (range, 6.6-15.6 months). The 2-year PFS rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13%-40%). The 2-year OS rate was 30% (95% CI, 16%-46%). Initial surgery with or without postoperative chemoradiation or radiation (P = .04) and complete resection with negative margins (P = .01) were significant predictors of improved OS even after adjustments for age, tumor size, and neck lymphadenopathy. Initial radiation or chemotherapy and the NUT translocation type were not associated with outcomes. HNNMC portends a poor prognosis. Aggressive initial surgical resection with or without postoperative chemoradiation or radiation is associated with significantly enhanced survival. Chemotherapy or radiation alone is often inadequate.

Survival outcomes of adolescent and adult patients with non-seminomatous testicular germ-cell tumors: A population-based study.,Journal of pediatric urology,J Pediatr Urol,2016-08-06,"In adolescents, approximately 90% of testicular germ cell tumors (T-GCTs) are non-seminomas (NS T-GCTs). Few studies have evaluated the impact of age, specifically in adolescence, on outcomes of NS T-GCTs. The purpose of this study was to review all patients diagnosed with NS T-GCTs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the association between age (adolescents vs. adults) and survival outcomes. The SEER database was queried for individuals ≥13 years old diagnosed with NS T-GCTs from 1995 to 2012. Patients were categorized into adolescent (13-19 years) and adult (≥20 years) cohorts. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis (MVA). A total of 13,963 patients (1496 adolescents, 12,467 adults) was included. Median follow-up was 71 months (range 1-215). Five-year overall survival (OS) for adolescent and adult patients was 94% and 92%, respectively (p = 0.007); 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 95% and 94%, respectively (p = 0.139). Under MVA, adolescent patients had improved OS (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.50-0.75; p < 0.001) and CSS (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51-0.82; p < 0.001), when compared with adults (Table). In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for demographics, adolescent patients were more likely to present with regional or distant metastatic disease (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.039), undergo an orchiectomy (OR 2.44; 95% CI 1.50-4.00; p < 0.001) or tumor excision (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.57-3.77; p < 0.001), and receive other adjuvant surgery (OR 5.87; 95% CI 2.25-15.30; p < 0.001).

KPS of 80-90% was significantly associated with better overall survival (p=0.006), one or no other metastatic sites showed a trend for a better outcome (p=0.10). The following scores were assigned: KPS 60-70%=0 points, KPS 80-90%=1 point, ≥2 other metastatic sites=0 points, 0-1 other metastatic sites=1 point.

Mutations or copy number losses of CD58 and TP53 genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma are independent unfavorable prognostic factors.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-12-01,"The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has expedited the discovery of novel genetic lesions in DLBCL. The prognostic significance of these identified gene mutations is largely unknown. In this study, we performed NGS for the 27 genes most frequently implicated in 196 patients. Interestingly, TP53 mutations were found to be significantly more common in DLBCL with MYC translocations (r = 0.446, P = 0.034). While no gene mutation was found to be more prevalent in patients with DLBCL with bone marrow involvement, MYD88 mutations were more common in primary DLBCL of the CNS or testis. To evaluate the prognostic significance of the abnormalities of these 27 genes, a total of 165 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, NOS were included in a multivariate survival analysis. Surprisingly, in addition to the TP53 mutation, CD58 mutation was found to predict poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, copy number loss of CD58 or TP53 was also identified to be an independent negative prognostic factor.

Density of immunogenic antigens does not explain the presence or absence of the T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in melanoma.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2016-11-11,"Melanoma metastases can be categorized by gene expression for the presence of a T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, which correlates with clinical efficacy of immunotherapies. T cells frequently recognize mutational antigens corresponding to nonsynonymous somatic mutations (NSSMs), and in some cases shared differentiation or cancer-testis antigens. Therapies are being pursued to trigger immune infiltration into non-T-cell-inflamed tumors in the hope of rendering them immunotherapy responsive. However, whether those tumors express antigens capable of T-cell recognition has not been explored. To address this question, 266 melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were categorized by the presence or absence of a T-cell-inflamed gene signature. These two subsets were interrogated for cancer-testis, differentiation, and somatic mutational antigens. No statistically significant differences were observed, including density of NSSMs. Focusing on hypothetical HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> binding scores, 707 peptides were synthesized, corresponding to all identified candidate neoepitopes. No differences were observed in measured HLA-A2 binding between inflamed and noninflamed cohorts. Twenty peptides were randomly selected from each cohort to evaluate priming and recognition by human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro with 25% of peptides confirmed to be immunogenic in both. A similar gene expression profile applied to all solid tumors of TCGA revealed no association between T-cell signature and NSSMs. Our results indicate that lack of spontaneous immune infiltration in solid tumors is unlikely due to lack of antigens. Strategies that improve T-cell infiltration into tumors may therefore be able to facilitate clinical response to immunotherapy once antigens become recognized.",Journal Article,1166.0,108.0,Melanoma metastases categorized expression presence T-cell-inflamed microenvironment correlates clinical efficacy immunotherapies frequently recognize antigens corresponding nonsynonymous somatic NSSMs cases shared differentiation cancer-testis antigens Therapies pursued trigger immune infiltration non-T-cell-inflamed hope rendering immunotherapy responsive express antigens capable T-cell recognition explored address question 266 melanomas Genome Atlas TCGA categorized presence absence T-cell-inflamed signature subsets interrogated cancer-testis differentiation somatic antigens statistically significant differences observed including density NSSMs Focusing hypothetical HLA-A2 sup /sup binding scores 707 peptides synthesized corresponding identified candidate neoepitopes differences observed measured HLA-A2 binding inflamed noninflamed cohorts peptides randomly selected cohort evaluate priming recognition human CD8 sup /sup vitro 25 peptides confirmed immunogenic similar expression profile applied solid TCGA revealed association T-cell signature NSSMs indicate lack spontaneous immune infiltration solid unlikely lack antigens Strategies improve T-cell infiltration able facilitate clinical response immunotherapy antigens recognized,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[196, 122, 40, 2320, 20, 145, 55, 9, 3, 463, 1, 8, 102, 31, 7647, 30, 995, 92, 1871, 5, 38, 209, 1, 2811, 102, 37, 746, 4237, 1619, 1575, 1734, 6, 10233, 1119, 138, 41596, 2, 4, 476, 140, 2664, 910, 15, 12, 7697, 1575, 235, 32, 486, 5299, 6, 5781, 250, 2084, 237, 220, 102, 31, 7647, 57, 4, 3, 3045, 1, 9535, 1370, 726, 2443, 137, 317, 135, 57, 1669, 1575, 2787, 1, 102, 31, 2335, 71, 44, 85, 1443, 6, 1539, 26, 2840, 8786, 1965, 29, 3, 12, 898, 2643, 2959, 11, 2320, 20, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 8, 102, 31, 7647, 145, 1651, 46, 100, 1890, 11, 7227, 9, 12, 7697, 910, 2, 1119, 1619, 1575, 77, 712, 93, 362, 11, 164, 141, 1263, 1, 41596, 3312, 23, 7045, 1160, 4099, 172, 172, 791, 703, 13939, 2491, 11, 5134, 1734, 6, 62, 108, 1609, 14052, 77, 362, 11, 164, 4, 644, 1160, 4099, 791, 59, 7647, 2, 36330, 736, 737, 2491, 11, 1108, 715, 29, 296, 180, 6, 376, 4903, 2, 2335, 20, 171, 968, 172, 172, 102, 37, 4, 439, 5, 243, 1, 2491, 557, 6, 40, 4190, 4, 110, 8, 288, 145, 55, 800, 1498, 6, 62, 537, 57, 1, 2959, 553, 77, 248, 59, 102, 31, 1651, 2, 41596, 114, 99, 1008, 17, 926, 1, 3280, 250, 2084, 4, 537, 57, 16, 3568, 520, 6, 926, 1, 1575, 422, 17, 401, 102, 31, 2084, 237, 57, 68, 673, 40, 1665, 6, 1876, 38, 51, 6, 726, 1059, 1575, 1417, 1904]",1750.0,27837020,Density immunogenic antigens explain presence absence T-cell-inflamed microenvironment melanoma,0,0.0
Intratumoral heterogeneity and chemoresistance in nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-12-01,"Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis (NSGCT) is largely curable. However, a small group of patients develop refractory disease. We investigated the hypothesis that intratumoral heterogeneity contributes to the emergence of chemoresistance and the development of refractory tumor subtypes. Our institution's records for January 2000 through December 2010 included 275 patients whose primary tumor showed pure embryonal carcinoma (pure E); mixed embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma (EYT); or mixed embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, seminoma, and teratoma (EYST). Patients with EYST had the highest cancer-specific mortality rate (P = .001). They tended to undergo somatic transformation (P = .0007). Two of 5 patients with clinical stage I EYST who had developed recurrence during active surveillance died of their disease. In this retrospective study, we evaluated consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with the three most common histological phenotypes of NSGCT. Chemoresistance was defined as the presence of teratoma, viable germ cell tumor, or somatic transformation in the residual tumor or the development of progressive or relapsed disease after chemotherapy.

Genomic evolution and chemoresistance in germ-cell tumours.,Nature,Nature,2016-11-01,"Germ-cell tumours (GCTs) are derived from germ cells and occur most frequently in the testes. GCTs are histologically heterogeneous and distinctly curable with chemotherapy. Gains of chromosome arm 12p and aneuploidy are nearly universal in GCTs, but specific somatic genomic features driving tumour initiation, chemosensitivity and progression are incompletely characterized. Here, using clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of precursor, primary (testicular and mediastinal) and chemoresistant metastatic human GCTs, we show that the primary somatic feature of GCTs is highly recurrent chromosome arm level amplifications and reciprocal deletions (reciprocal loss of heterozygosity), variations that are significantly enriched in GCTs compared to 19 other cancer types. These tumours also acquire KRAS mutations during the development from precursor to primary disease, and primary testicular GCTs (TGCTs) are uniformly wild type for TP53. In addition, by functional measurement of apoptotic signalling (BH3 profiling) of fresh tumour and adjacent tissue, we find that primary TGCTs have high mitochondrial priming that facilitates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Finally, by phylogenetic analysis of serial TGCTs that emerge with chemotherapy resistance, we show how TGCTs gain additional reciprocal loss of heterozygosity and that this is associated with loss of pluripotency markers (NANOG and POU5F1) in chemoresistant teratomas or transformed carcinomas. Our results demonstrate the distinct genomic features underlying the origins of this disease and associated with the chemosensitivity phenotype, as well as the rare progression to chemoresistance. These results identify the convergence of cancer genomics, mitochondrial priming and GCT evolution, and may provide insights into chemosensitivity and resistance in other cancers.",Journal Article,1176.0,56.0,Germ-cell tumours GCTs derived germ occur frequently testes GCTs histologically heterogeneous distinctly curable chemotherapy Gains chromosome arm 12p aneuploidy nearly universal GCTs specific somatic genomic features driving tumour initiation chemosensitivity progression incompletely characterized clinical whole-exome transcriptome sequencing precursor primary testicular mediastinal chemoresistant metastatic human GCTs primary somatic feature GCTs highly recurrent chromosome arm level amplifications reciprocal deletions reciprocal loss heterozygosity variations significantly enriched GCTs compared 19 types tumours acquire KRAS development precursor primary disease primary testicular GCTs TGCTs uniformly wild type TP53 addition functional measurement apoptotic signalling BH3 profiling fresh tumour adjacent tissue primary TGCTs high mitochondrial priming facilitates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis Finally phylogenetic serial TGCTs emerge chemotherapy resistance TGCTs gain additional reciprocal loss heterozygosity associated loss pluripotency markers NANOG POU5F1 chemoresistant teratomas transformed carcinomas demonstrate distinct genomic features underlying origins disease associated chemosensitivity phenotype rare progression chemoresistance identify convergence genomics mitochondrial priming GCT evolution provide insights chemosensitivity resistance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2280, 31, 1319, 5553, 32, 526, 29, 2280, 37, 2, 1271, 96, 746, 4, 3, 13100, 5553, 32, 2161, 1564, 2, 9452, 4151, 5, 56, 3849, 1, 1170, 475, 18936, 2, 7437, 32, 1857, 4967, 4, 5553, 84, 112, 1119, 572, 404, 4057, 770, 1118, 5522, 2, 91, 32, 5252, 765, 467, 75, 38, 902, 2865, 2, 3917, 615, 1, 2765, 86, 2, 2626, 2, 5530, 113, 171, 5553, 21, 514, 17, 3, 86, 1119, 2705, 1, 5553, 16, 561, 387, 1170, 475, 301, 4877, 2, 8020, 2439, 8020, 407, 1, 3963, 2293, 17, 32, 97, 2220, 4, 5553, 72, 6, 326, 127, 12, 630, 46, 1319, 120, 6206, 723, 138, 190, 3, 193, 29, 2765, 6, 86, 34, 2, 86, 5553, 15427, 32, 4254, 955, 267, 9, 1206, 4, 352, 20, 583, 2204, 1, 1631, 3128, 5486, 1080, 1, 4329, 770, 2, 2086, 246, 21, 2469, 17, 86, 15427, 47, 64, 2019, 4903, 17, 4936, 56, 277, 351, 1368, 20, 22612, 65, 1, 2108, 15427, 17, 6371, 5, 56, 251, 21, 514, 832, 15427, 1803, 402, 8020, 407, 1, 3963, 2, 17, 26, 16, 41, 5, 407, 1, 13153, 525, 11851, 2, 34181, 4, 5530, 14275, 15, 2423, 826, 114, 99, 608, 3, 834, 572, 404, 1181, 3, 8598, 1, 26, 34, 2, 41, 5, 3, 5522, 1005, 22, 149, 22, 3, 622, 91, 6, 3782, 46, 99, 255, 3, 12312, 1, 12, 4229, 2019, 4903, 2, 3856, 2554, 2, 68, 377, 1957, 237, 5522, 2, 251, 4, 127, 163]",1794.0,27905446,Genomic evolution chemoresistance germ-cell tumours,0,0.0

An 11-year-old male with a history of metastatic tectal plate low-grade glioma who was diagnosed at age 2.8 years transferred his care to the long-term follow-up clinic. He completed treatment with multiagent chemotherapy-carboplatin, vincristine, temozolomide, procarbazine, lomustine, and thioguanine-at age 4.5 years and did not require radiotherapy. At primary diagnosis, he presented with hydrocephalus that required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, with a subsequent shunt revision at age 6 years. Residual metastatic tumors in the third and fourth ventricles and in the suprasellar region remained stable for more than 5 years. The patient achieved normal developmental milestones and was not taking medications. He was offered screening for hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) dysfunction because of his suprasellar lesion. His height was at the 25th percentile for chronological age, with decline from the 50th percentile noted during the preceding 18 months ( Fig 1 , point c). Pubertal stage was Tanner 4 for pubic hair and penile size, which contrasted with small testes (4.5 mL). Pubic hair and voice changes were noticed 2 to 3 years before this visit. Plasma testosterone level was consistent with Tanner 4 (255 ng/dL = 8.9 nmol/L). An x-ray of the left hand revealed a notably advanced bone age of 15.5 years. Plasma free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and 8 am cortisol levels were normal.

Cancer Res.,2016-12-30,"<b>Purpose:</b> Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs worldwide and one of the most ototoxic. We sought to identify genetic variants that modulate cisplatin-associated ototoxicity (CAO).<b>Experimental Design:</b> We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CAO using quantitative audiometry (4-12 kHz) in 511 testicular cancer survivors of European genetic ancestry. We performed polygenic modeling and functional analyses using a variety of publicly available databases. We used an electronic health record cohort to replicate our top mechanistic finding.<b>Results:</b> One SNP, rs62283056, in the first intron of Mendelian deafness gene <i>WFS1</i> (wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein) and an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for <i>WFS1</i> met genome-wide significance for association with CAO (<i>P</i> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). A significant interaction between cumulative cisplatin dose and rs62283056 genotype was evident, indicating that higher cisplatin doses exacerbate hearing loss in patients with the minor allele (<i>P</i> = 0.035). The association between decreased <i>WFS1</i> expression and hearing loss was replicated in an independent BioVU cohort (<i>n</i> = 18,620 patients, Bonferroni adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.05). Beyond this top signal, we show CAO is a polygenic trait and that SNPs in and near 84 known Mendelian deafness genes are significantly enriched for low <i>P</i> values in the GWAS (<i>P</i> = 0.048).<b>Conclusions:</b> We show for the first time the role of <i>WFS1</i> in CAO and document a statistically significant interaction between increasing cumulative cisplatin dose and rs62283056 genotype. Our clinical translational results demonstrate that pretherapy patient genotyping to minimize ototoxicity could be useful when deciding between cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens of comparable efficacy with different cumulative doses. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(13); 3325-33. ©2016 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1117.0,26.0,"b Purpose /b Cisplatin commonly chemotherapy drugs worldwide ototoxic sought identify genetic modulate cisplatin-associated ototoxicity CAO b Experimental Design /b performed genome-wide association GWAS CAO quantitative audiometry 4-12 kHz 511 testicular survivors European genetic ancestry performed polygenic modeling functional variety publicly available databases electronic health record cohort replicate mechanistic finding. b /b SNP rs62283056 intron Mendelian deafness WFS1 /i wolframin ER transmembrane glycoprotein expression quantitative trait locus eQTL WFS1 /i met genome-wide significance association CAO P /i 1.4 10 sup -8 /sup significant interaction cumulative cisplatin dose rs62283056 genotype evident indicating higher cisplatin doses exacerbate hearing loss patients minor allele P /i 0.035 association decreased WFS1 /i expression hearing loss replicated independent BioVU cohort n /i 18,620 patients Bonferroni adjusted P /i 0.05 signal CAO polygenic trait SNPs near 84 known Mendelian deafness significantly enriched low P /i values GWAS P /i 0.048 b Conclusions /b time role WFS1 /i CAO document statistically significant interaction increasing cumulative cisplatin dose rs62283056 genotype clinical translational demonstrate pretherapy patient genotyping minimize ototoxicity useful deciding cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens comparable efficacy different cumulative doses Clin Res 23 13 3325-33 ©2016 AACR /i",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 540, 16, 104, 1, 3, 96, 841, 95, 56, 600, 2358, 2, 104, 1, 3, 96, 20327, 21, 990, 6, 255, 336, 839, 17, 3319, 540, 41, 8760, 26777, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 21, 173, 8, 898, 1019, 248, 45, 3297, 1, 26777, 75, 1156, 36356, 39, 133, 20607, 4, 10532, 12, 332, 1, 1865, 336, 3535, 21, 173, 11709, 2057, 2, 583, 318, 75, 8, 1362, 1, 6878, 390, 2348, 21, 95, 35, 3098, 341, 3237, 180, 6, 6423, 114, 3150, 2716, 1567, 132, 99, 132, 104, 1845, 41640, 4, 3, 157, 6259, 1, 12728, 29863, 145, 70, 36357, 70, 69590, 516, 5527, 4455, 2, 35, 55, 1156, 7648, 2474, 10770, 9, 70, 36357, 70, 543, 898, 1019, 724, 9, 248, 5, 26777, 70, 19, 70, 14, 39, 79, 172, 66, 172, 8, 93, 915, 59, 967, 540, 61, 2, 41640, 1183, 10, 2853, 1716, 17, 142, 540, 415, 11910, 4396, 407, 4, 7, 5, 3, 2278, 1254, 70, 19, 70, 13, 4514, 3, 248, 59, 340, 70, 36357, 70, 55, 2, 4396, 407, 10, 6714, 4, 35, 306, 41182, 180, 70, 78, 70, 203, 10811, 7, 10115, 586, 70, 19, 70, 13, 474, 1654, 26, 3150, 1235, 21, 514, 26777, 16, 8, 11709, 7648, 2, 17, 1109, 4, 2, 1829, 874, 440, 12728, 29863, 214, 32, 97, 2220, 9, 154, 70, 19, 70, 1030, 4, 3, 3297, 70, 19, 70, 13, 4969, 132, 2130, 132, 21, 514, 9, 3, 157, 98, 3, 200, 1, 70, 36357, 70, 4, 26777, 2, 4753, 8, 712, 93, 915, 59, 602, 967, 540, 61, 2, 41640, 1183, 114, 38, 2460, 99, 608, 17, 8857, 69, 2686, 6, 3241, 8760, 359, 40, 999, 198, 10160, 59, 540, 90, 56, 472, 1, 1279, 209, 5, 338, 967, 415, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 233, 50162, 466, 3456, 1630, 70]",1884.0,28039263,WFS1 /i Mendelian Deafness Associated Cisplatin-Associated Ototoxicity,0,0.0

Patterns of care and survival outcomes for adolescent and young adult patients with testicular seminoma in the United States: A National Cancer Database analysis.,Journal of pediatric urology,J Pediatr Urol,2017-01-17,"Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) are the most common solid tumor among adolescent and young adult (AYA) males. AYA patients with GCTs most typically have non-seminoma compared with seminoma, and accordingly there are fewer data reported on the AYA experience with testicular seminoma. To evaluate national trends in postoperative treatment and overall survival (OS) outcomes in testicular seminoma by age group, specifically comparing AYAs with older adults. The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was queried for patients with testicular seminoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2012, who underwent orchiectomy followed by observation or adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiation (RT), or both). Patients were grouped by age: AYA (15-39 years), adults between 40 and 55 years, and adults >55 years. Overall survival (OS) was presented using Kaplan-Meier curves and groups compared via a log-rank test. Univariate (UVA) and multivariate (MVA) analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Binary multiple logistic regression identified differences in variables by age category. Of the total 22,361 patients the majority were AYAs (12,880, 57.6%), followed by adults 40-55 years (8,022, 35.9%), and >55 years (1,459, 6.5%). Unadjusted 5-year OS was significantly better for AYAs versus adults 40-55 years and >55 years (98.0%, 96.4%, 87.7%; p < 0.001), as was 10-year OS (96.1%, 91.8%, 71.3% respectively; p < 0.001). The Table shows that on a MVA, OS was significantly better for AYAs versus adults 40-55 years and adults >55 years. AYA patients were also more commonly treated at centers with greater clinical volume. Additionally, AYA patients were less likely to present with metastatic disease. Accordingly, AYA patients were less likely to undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (OR 0.81; p = 0.001) and were less often managed with adjuvant therapy including chemotherapy (OR 0.91; p = 0.027), RT (OR 0.93; p = 0.025), or both (OR 0.68; p = 0.020). AYA patients with testicular seminoma present with earlier stage disease and in the clinical Stage I setting are more often are managed with active surveillance following orchiectomy when compared with older adults in this population-based analysis.

Multi-Institutional Assessment of Adverse Health Outcomes Among North American Testicular Cancer Survivors After Modern Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-02-27,"Purpose To provide new information on adverse health outcomes (AHOs) in testicular cancer survivors (TCSs) after four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EPX4) or three or four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEPX3/BEPX4). Methods Nine hundred fifty-two TCSs > 1 year postchemotherapy underwent physical examination and completed a questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression estimated AHOs odds ratios (ORs) in relation to age, cumulative cisplatin and/or bleomycin dose, time since chemotherapy, sociodemographic factors, and health behaviors. Results Median age at evaluation was 37 years; median time since chemotherapy was 4.3 years. Chemotherapy consisted largely of BEPX3 (38.2%), EPX4 (30.9%), and BEPX4 (17.9%). None, one to two, three to four, or five or more AHOs were reported by 20.4%, 42.0%, 25.1%, and 12.5% of TCSs, respectively. Median number after EPX4 or BEPX3 was two (range, zero to nine and zero to 11, respectively; P > .05) and two (range, zero to 10) after BEPX4. When comparing individual AHOs for EPX4 versus BEPX3, Raynaud phenomenon (11.6% v 21.4%; P < .01), peripheral neuropathy (29.2% v 21.4%; P = .02), and obesity (25.5% v 33.0%; P = .04) differed. Larger cumulative bleomycin doses (OR, 1.44 per 90,000 IU) were significantly associated with five or more AHOs. Increasing age was a significant risk factor for one to two, three to four, or five or more AHOs versus zero AHOs (OR, 1.22, 1.50, and 1.87 per 5 years, respectively; P < .01); vigorous physical activity was protective (OR, 0.62, 0.51, and 0.41, respectively; P < .05). Significant risk factors for three to four and five or more AHOs included current (OR, 3.05 and 3.73) or former (OR, 1.61 and 1.76) smoking ( P < .05). Self-reported health was excellent/very good in 59.9% of TCSs but decreased as AHOs increased ( P < .001). Conclusion Numbers of AHOs after EPX4 or BEPX3 appear similar, with median follow-up of 4.3 years.

Immunotherapeutic target expression on breast tumors can be amplified by hormone receptor antagonism: a novel strategy for enhancing efficacy of targeted immunotherapy.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-05-01,"Immunotherapy has historically been successful in highly antigenic tumors but has shown limited therapeutic efficacy in non-antigenic tumors such as breast cancers. Our previous studies in autoimmunity have demonstrated that increased antigen load within a tissue enhances immune reactivity against it. We therefore hypothesized that enhancing expression of target proteins on breast tumors can increase efficacy of targeted immunotherapy. We hypothesized that antagonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) can increase expression of targets that are hormonally regulated and facilitate enhanced tumor recognition by targeted immunotherapy. We used a lactation protein α-Lactalbumin, a known immunotherapeutic target on breast tumors, as our model target antigen. Enhancement of target protein expression in human and murine breast tumors was tested in vitro and in vivo by ER antagonism using clinically established ER modulators, Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant. We show that antagonism of the ER can induce a 2-3 fold increase in expression of target proteins on tumors leaving the normal breast tissue unaffected. Tumor progression studies in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice show that efficacy of adoptively transferred cell based targeted immunotherapy was enhanced by target antigen amplification resulting in significantly higher tumor inhibition. However, in spite of increased target expression, anti-tumor efficacy of direct immunization was not enhanced probably due to other limiting factors involved in the immune priming process.

Functional characterization of a multi-cancer risk locus on chr5p15.33 reveals regulation of TERT by ZNF148.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2017-05-02,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped multiple independent cancer susceptibility loci to chr5p15.33. Here, we show that fine-mapping of pancreatic and testicular cancer GWAS within one of these loci (Region 2 in CLPTM1L) focuses the signal to nine highly correlated SNPs. Of these, rs36115365-C associated with increased pancreatic and testicular but decreased lung cancer and melanoma risk, and exhibited preferred protein-binding and enhanced regulatory activity. Transcriptional gene silencing of this regulatory element repressed TERT expression in an allele-specific manner. Proteomic analysis identifies allele-preferred binding of Zinc finger protein 148 (ZNF148) to rs36115365-C, further supported by binding of purified recombinant ZNF148. Knockdown of ZNF148 results in reduced TERT expression, telomerase activity and telomere length.

Cancer Res.,2017-06-13,"<b>Purpose:</b> Our purpose was to characterize the clinical influences, genetic risk factors, and gene mechanisms contributing to persistent cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (CisIPN) in testicular cancer survivors (TCSs).<b>Experimental Design:</b> TCS given cisplatin-based therapy completed the validated EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire. An ordinal CisIPN phenotype was derived, and associations with age, smoking, excess drinking, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cumulative cisplatin dose, and self-reported health were examined for 680 TCS. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome chip. Following quality control and imputation, 5.1 million SNPs in 680 genetically European TCS formed the input set. GWAS and PrediXcan were used to identify genetic variation and genetically determined gene expression traits, respectively, contributing to CisIPN. We evaluated two independent datasets for replication: Vanderbilt's electronic health database (BioVU) and the CALGB 90401 trial.<b>Results:</b> Eight sensory items formed a subscale with good internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Variables significantly associated with CisIPN included age at diagnosis (OR per year, 1.06; <i>P</i> = 2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), smoking (OR, 1.54; <i>P</i> = 0.004), excess drinking (OR, 1.83; <i>P</i> = 0.007), and hypertension (OR, 1.61; <i>P</i> = 0.03). CisIPN was correlated with lower self-reported health (OR, 0.56; <i>P</i> = 2.6 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) and weight gain adjusted for years since treatment (OR per Δkg/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.05; <i>P</i> = 0.004).

Inhibiting DNA methylation activates cancer testis antigens and expression of the antigen processing and presentation machinery in colon and ovarian cancer cells.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-16,"Innovative therapies for solid tumors are urgently needed. Recently, therapies that harness the host immune system to fight cancer cells have successfully treated a subset of patients with solid tumors. These responses have been strong and durable but observed in subsets of patients. Work from our group and others has shown that epigenetic therapy, specifically inhibiting the silencing DNA methylation mark, activates immune signaling in tumor cells and can sensitize to immune therapy in murine models. Here we show that colon and ovarian cancer cell lines exhibit lower expression of transcripts involved in antigen processing and presentation to immune cells compared to normal tissues. In addition, treatment with clinically relevant low doses of DNMT inhibitors (that remove DNA methylation) increases expression of both antigen processing and presentation and Cancer Testis Antigens in these cell lines.

A therapeutic T cell receptor mimic antibody targets tumor-associated PRAME peptide/HLA-I antigens.,The Journal of clinical investigation,J. Clin. Invest.,2017-06-19,"Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) is a cancer-testis antigen that is expressed in many cancers and leukemias. In healthy tissue, PRAME expression is limited to the testes and ovaries, making it a highly attractive cancer target. PRAME is an intracellular protein that cannot currently be drugged. After proteasomal processing, the PRAME300-309 peptide ALYVDSLFFL (ALY) is presented in the context of human leukocyte antigen HLA-A*02:01 molecules for recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR) of cytotoxic T cells. Here, we have described Pr20, a TCR mimic (TCRm) human IgG1 antibody that recognizes the cell-surface ALY peptide/HLA-A2 complex. Pr20 is an immunological tool and potential therapeutic agent. Pr20 bound to PRAME+HLA-A2+ cancers. An afucosylated Fc form (Pr20M) directed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against PRAME+HLA-A2+ leukemia cells and was therapeutically effective against mouse xenograft models of human leukemia. In some tumors, Pr20 binding markedly increased upon IFN-γ treatment, mediated by induction of the immunoproteasome catalytic subunit β5i. The immunoproteasome reduced internal destructive cleavages within the ALY epitope compared with the constitutive proteasome. The data provide rationale for developing TCRm antibodies as therapeutic agents for cancer, offer mechanistic insight on proteasomal regulation of tumor-associated peptide/HLA antigen complexes, and yield possible therapeutic solutions to target antigens with ultra-low surface presentation.",Journal Article,946.0,16.0,Preferentially expressed antigen melanoma PRAME cancer-testis antigen expressed leukemias healthy tissue PRAME expression limited testes ovaries making highly attractive target PRAME intracellular currently drugged proteasomal processing PRAME300-309 peptide ALYVDSLFFL ALY presented context human leukocyte antigen HLA-A*02:01 molecules recognition receptor TCR cytotoxic described Pr20 TCR mimic TCRm human IgG1 antibody recognizes cell-surface ALY peptide/HLA-A2 complex Pr20 immunological tool potential therapeutic agent Pr20 bound PRAME+HLA-A2+ afucosylated Fc form Pr20M directed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity PRAME+HLA-A2+ leukemia therapeutically effective mouse xenograft models human leukemia Pr20 binding markedly increased IFN-γ treatment mediated induction immunoproteasome catalytic subunit β5i immunoproteasome reduced internal destructive cleavages ALY epitope compared constitutive proteasome provide rationale developing TCRm antibodies therapeutic agents offer mechanistic insight proteasomal regulation tumor-associated peptide/HLA antigen complexes yield possible therapeutic solutions target antigens ultra-low surface presentation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3509, 570, 448, 4, 13120, 16, 8, 12, 7697, 448, 17, 16, 570, 4, 445, 163, 2, 2792, 4, 1331, 246, 13120, 55, 16, 383, 6, 3, 13100, 2, 7262, 1079, 192, 8, 561, 3059, 12, 283, 13120, 16, 35, 2087, 178, 17, 122, 44, 694, 40, 49341, 50, 10033, 3325, 3, 70618, 9440, 1389, 70619, 41799, 16, 917, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 171, 3627, 448, 1160, 8, 588, 355, 1598, 9, 2335, 20, 3, 102, 31, 153, 4134, 1, 759, 102, 37, 467, 21, 47, 1027, 36442, 8, 4134, 5356, 27618, 171, 8019, 548, 17, 10646, 3, 31, 1255, 41799, 1389, 1160, 4099, 840, 36442, 16, 35, 5073, 1515, 2, 174, 189, 420, 36442, 2951, 6, 13120, 1160, 4099, 163, 35, 50449, 4127, 1297, 70620, 1166, 548, 470, 763, 1408, 480, 13120, 1160, 4099, 37, 2, 10, 4602, 323, 480, 830, 1330, 274, 1, 171, 4, 476, 57, 36442, 791, 2195, 101, 1548, 1256, 2655, 24, 517, 20, 504, 1, 3, 13374, 4784, 3350, 36443, 3, 13374, 405, 2329, 11122, 38745, 262, 3, 41799, 4430, 72, 5, 3, 3178, 1694, 3, 74, 377, 1728, 9, 931, 27618, 890, 22, 189, 183, 9, 12, 1918, 2716, 2670, 23, 10033, 863, 1, 30, 41, 1389, 1160, 448, 3817, 2, 2309, 899, 189, 6947, 6, 283, 1575, 5, 12223, 154, 1255, 1031]",1465.0,28628042,therapeutic receptor mimic antibody targets tumor-associated PRAME peptide/HLA-I antigens,2,0.006779661016949152
Quantifying Decreased Radiation Exposure From Modern CT Scan Technology and Surveillance Programs of Germ Cell Tumors.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin.

This reduction, combined with changes in surveillance protocols in clinical stage I testicular cancer (CS1TC) measurably decrease the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of dying of radiation-associated cancer. This IRB-approved study enrolled 24 CS1TC patients who had CT scans on the same Toshiba Aquilion 64 CT before and after IRT software installation. Dose-length product and CT dose index volume were recorded. A physicist calculated effective doses. Radiation doses were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Median effective dose per scan was multiplied by scan number based on 16 versus 7 scans in 5-year AS protocols to calculate estimated cumulative dose (ECD). LAR of dying of radiation-associated solid tumor was estimated using ECD for a single exposure at age 35 with the excess absolute risk transport model from the BEIR VII analysis of long-term atomic bomb survivors. Median preupgrade and postupgrade effective doses were 12.5 and 7.7 mSv, respectively (P<0.0001). A linear regression model with a constrained zero intercept fit to the data found that IRT dose was estimated as 61% of filtered back projection dose (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.66). The IRT upgrade reduced the LAR of the 16-scan protocol 35%. Combination of IRT upgrade and 7-scan protocol reduced surveillance LAR 72%.

Testicular vs adrenal sources of hydroxy-androgens in prostate cancer.,Endocrine-related cancer,Endocr. Relat. Cancer,2017-06-29,"Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) is one strategy for the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer; however, the long-term outcomes of NADT with radical prostatectomy including biochemical failure-free survival are not promising. One proposed mechanism is incomplete androgen ablation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of serum hydroxy-androgen suppression in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer under NADT (leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone) and interrogate the primary sources of circulating hydroxy-androgens using our recently described stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method. For the first time, three androgen diols including 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol (5-adiol), 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol), 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-adiol), the glucuronide or sulfate conjugate of 5-adiol and 3α-adiol were measured and observed to be dramatically reduced after NADT. By comparing patients that took leuprolide acetate alone vs leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone, we were able to distinguish the primary sources of these androgens and their conjugates as being of either testicular or adrenal in origin. We find that testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 3α-adiol and 3β-adiol were predominately of testicular origin. By contrast, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), epi-androsterone (epi-AST) and their conjugates, 5-adiol sulfate and glucuronide were predominately of adrenal origin. Our findings also show that NADT failed to completely suppress DHEA-sulfate levels and that two unappreciated sources of intratumoral androgens that were not suppressed by leuprolide acetate alone were 5-adiol-sulfate and epi-AST-sulfate of adrenal origin.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",936.0,7.0,"Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy NADT strategy treatment early-stage prostate long-term outcomes NADT radical prostatectomy including biochemical failure-free survival promising proposed mechanism incomplete androgen ablation aimed evaluate efficiency serum hydroxy-androgen suppression patients localized high-risk prostate NADT leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate prednisone interrogate primary sources circulating hydroxy-androgens recently described stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography mass spectrometric time androgen diols including 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol 5-adiol 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol 3α-adiol 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol 3β-adiol glucuronide sulfate conjugate 5-adiol 3α-adiol measured observed dramatically reduced NADT comparing patients took leuprolide acetate vs leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate prednisone able distinguish primary sources androgens conjugates testicular adrenal origin testosterone 5α-dihydrotestosterone DHT 3α-adiol 3β-adiol predominately testicular origin contrast dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA epi-androsterone epi-AST conjugates 5-adiol sulfate glucuronide predominately adrenal origin findings NADT failed completely suppress DHEA-sulfate levels unappreciated sources intratumoral androgens suppressed leuprolide acetate 5-adiol-sulfate epi-AST-sulfate adrenal origin",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[536, 687, 1868, 36, 32753, 16, 104, 692, 9, 3, 24, 1, 191, 82, 12, 137, 3, 319, 337, 123, 1, 32753, 5, 711, 1202, 141, 1487, 496, 115, 25, 32, 44, 721, 104, 1587, 670, 16, 2610, 687, 1650, 4, 26, 45, 21, 1295, 6, 376, 3, 2904, 1, 524, 10175, 687, 1332, 4, 7, 5, 909, 64, 43, 12, 669, 32753, 13106, 3424, 349, 2260, 3424, 2, 1979, 2, 8415, 3, 86, 3375, 1, 1033, 10175, 5488, 75, 114, 761, 1027, 585, 9242, 10446, 3165, 5140, 782, 14506, 596, 9, 3, 157, 98, 169, 687, 70726, 141, 33, 35907, 10505, 21592, 19687, 33, 24299, 8426, 50473, 15397, 21592, 19687, 15397, 24299, 8426, 50473, 10505, 21592, 19687, 10505, 24299, 3, 11435, 15, 6424, 3998, 1, 33, 24299, 2, 15397, 24299, 11, 644, 2, 164, 6, 40, 2729, 405, 50, 32753, 20, 1430, 7, 17, 5060, 13106, 3424, 279, 105, 13106, 3424, 349, 2260, 3424, 2, 1979, 21, 11, 1665, 6, 3081, 3, 86, 3375, 1, 46, 5488, 2, 136, 5968, 22, 486, 1, 361, 15, 2987, 4, 1938, 21, 2469, 17, 2660, 8426, 7529, 7248, 15397, 24299, 2, 10505, 24299, 11, 11583, 1, 1938, 20, 748, 12317, 10850, 8068, 40561, 8068, 5759, 2, 136, 5968, 33, 24299, 6424, 2, 11435, 11, 11583, 1, 2987, 1938, 114, 272, 120, 514, 17, 32753, 1551, 6, 2500, 3134, 10850, 6424, 148, 2, 17, 100, 16921, 3375, 1, 2074, 5488, 17, 11, 44, 1908, 20, 13106, 3424, 279, 11, 33, 24299, 6424, 2, 8068, 5759, 6424, 1, 2987, 1938]",1697.0,28663228,Testicular vs adrenal sources hydroxy-androgens prostate,8,0.02711864406779661
Contemporary Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Clinical Stage IS Testicular Cancer.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2017-07-04,"Controversy exists regarding the optimal management strategy for clinical stage IS seminomatous (SGCT) and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) of the testis. To assess contemporary treatment patterns and outcomes for clinical stage IS testicular cancer. Using the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2012), we identified 1362 patients with clinical stage IS SGCT and NSGCT of the testis, treated with either adjuvant treatment (AT) or observation. We calculated the annual percent change (APC) to assess treatment trends. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to compare overall survival (OS) between AT and observation groups. Analyses were stratified by histologic type. Overall, there were 581 (43%) and 781 (57%) men with SGCT and NSGCT, respectively. Among men with SGCT, the use of AT decreased over the study period (APC=-2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.4, -1.1, p=0.001). The 5-yr IPTW-adjusted rates of OS were 99% and 97% in the AT and observation groups, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.12, 1.14, p=0.08). Among men with NSGCT, the use of AT remained stable over the study period (APC = +0.8, 95% CI: -0.7, +2.2, p=0.29). The 5-yr IPTW-adjusted rates of OS were 97% and 95% in the AT and observation groups, respectively (HR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.61, p=0.36). Limitations include the lack of full treatment details and cancer-specific survival information. Trends in the use of AT significantly decreased over time for SGCT, while it remained stable for NSGCT.

To be clinically useful, methodologies used to identify high and low risk disease must be validated in representative independent clinical data and available so that patients can be managed appropriately. A recent analysis has indicated that SKY92 combined with the International Staging System (ISS) identifies patients with different risk disease with high sensitivity. Here we computed the performance of eight gene expression based classifiers SKY92, UAMS70, UAMS80, IFM15, Proliferation Index, Centrosome Index, Cancer Testis Antigen and HM19 as well as the combination of SKY92/ISS in an independent cohort of 91 newly diagnosed MM patients. The classifiers identified between 9%-21% of patients as high risk, with hazard ratios (HRs) between 1.9 and 8.2. Among the eight signatures, SKY92 identified the largest proportion of patients (21%) also with the highest HR (8.2).

Age ≥40 Years Is Associated with Adverse Outcome in Metastatic Germ Cell Cancer Despite Appropriate Intended Chemotherapy.,European urology focus,Eur Urol Focus,2016-10-26,"Age ≥40 yr is associated with poorer testicular cancer outcomes in population-based studies. To assess the association between age (≥40 yr) and outcomes among men with germ cell tumors (GCTs) in a large hospital registry. Electronic medical records for 1095 GCT patients treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 1997 and 2013 were reviewed. Information regarding histology, stage, treatment, and patient characteristics was obtained. Using logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression, we investigated the association between age and treatment and risk of relapse and GCT-specific death for men with GCT. At diagnosis, 26% of men (n=283/1095) were ≥40 yr. Among the 610 men with clinical stage 1 (CS1) disease, age ≥40 yr was not associated with a higher risk of CS1 relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.92). There were 603 men with metastatic disease (CS1 at diagnosis with subsequent relapse or metastasis at diagnosis); after adjusting for stage and histology, men ≥40 yr were more likely to receive etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy compared to bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin as their primary treatment (odds ratio 2.40, 95% CI 1.14-5.05). Salvage therapy also differed by age. In the multivariable model, men ≥40 yr with metastatic GCT had a higher risk of relapse (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02-2.46) after primary treatment and death from GCT (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.29-4.15). The study limitations include incomplete data on medical comorbidities and possible subsequent dose modifications. Men aged ≥40 yr with metastatic GCT have poorer outcomes, even after accounting for different intended treatment patterns. In this study we looked at the outcome for testicular cancer in more than 1000 patients treated at a single institution in the USA. We found that the treatment for metastatic disease differed between older (≥40 yr) and younger patients. Furthermore, outcomes for older patients (≥40 yr) were worse than for younger men.",Comparative Study,1182.0,4.0,Age ≥40 yr associated poorer testicular outcomes population-based studies assess association age ≥40 yr outcomes men germ GCTs large hospital registry Electronic medical records 1095 GCT patients treated Dana-Farber Institute 1997 2013 reviewed Information histology stage treatment patient characteristics obtained logistic regression Cox proportional hazards regression investigated association age treatment risk relapse GCT-specific death men GCT diagnosis 26 men n=283/1095 ≥40 yr 610 men clinical stage 1 CS1 disease age ≥40 yr associated higher risk CS1 relapse hazard ratio HR 1.19 95 confidence interval CI 0.74-1.92 603 men metastatic disease CS1 diagnosis subsequent relapse metastasis diagnosis adjusting stage histology men ≥40 yr likely receive etoposide cisplatin chemotherapy compared bleomycin etoposide cisplatin primary treatment odds ratio 2.40 95 CI 1.14-5.05 Salvage therapy differed age multivariable model men ≥40 yr metastatic GCT higher risk relapse HR 1.58 95 CI 1.02-2.46 primary treatment death GCT HR 2.31 95 CI 1.29-4.15 limitations include incomplete medical comorbidities possible subsequent dose modifications Men aged ≥40 yr metastatic GCT poorer outcomes accounting different intended treatment patterns looked outcome testicular 1000 patients treated single institution USA treatment metastatic disease differed older ≥40 yr younger patients Furthermore outcomes older patients ≥40 yr worse younger men,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[89, 8483, 2830, 16, 41, 5, 1769, 12, 123, 4, 266, 90, 94, 6, 423, 3, 248, 59, 89, 8483, 2830, 2, 123, 107, 325, 5, 2280, 31, 57, 5553, 4, 8, 375, 702, 1608, 3098, 484, 1064, 9, 23513, 3856, 7, 73, 28, 4932, 4979, 12, 1377, 59, 2341, 2, 1346, 11, 446, 487, 666, 784, 82, 24, 2, 69, 374, 10, 683, 75, 812, 320, 65, 2, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 21, 565, 3, 248, 59, 89, 2, 24, 2, 43, 1, 429, 2, 3856, 112, 273, 9, 325, 5, 3856, 28, 147, 432, 1, 325, 78, 9078, 23513, 11, 8483, 2830, 107, 3, 11302, 325, 5, 38, 82, 14, 9714, 34, 89, 8483, 2830, 10, 44, 41, 5, 8, 142, 43, 1, 9714, 429, 360, 197, 168, 14, 326, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 794, 14, 937, 125, 11, 9696, 325, 5, 113, 34, 9714, 28, 147, 5, 706, 429, 15, 278, 28, 147, 50, 1358, 9, 82, 2, 784, 325, 8483, 2830, 11, 80, 322, 6, 560, 1934, 2, 540, 56, 72, 6, 5213, 1934, 2, 540, 22, 136, 86, 24, 610, 197, 18, 327, 48, 58, 14, 213, 33, 474, 992, 36, 120, 2512, 20, 89, 4, 3, 658, 202, 325, 8483, 2830, 5, 113, 3856, 42, 8, 142, 43, 1, 429, 168, 14, 717, 48, 58, 14, 588, 18, 641, 50, 86, 24, 2, 273, 29, 3856, 168, 18, 456, 48, 58, 14, 462, 39, 167, 3, 45, 1939, 643, 2610, 74, 23, 484, 1909, 2, 899, 706, 61, 2916, 325, 1032, 8483, 2830, 5, 113, 3856, 47, 1769, 123, 871, 50, 3116, 9, 338, 4081, 24, 764, 4, 26, 45, 21, 13058, 28, 3, 228, 9, 12, 4, 80, 76, 2345, 7, 73, 28, 8, 226, 731, 4, 3, 2706, 21, 204, 17, 3, 24, 9, 113, 34, 2512, 59, 434, 8483, 2830, 2, 773, 7, 798, 123, 9, 434, 7, 8483, 2830, 11, 639, 76, 9, 773, 325]",1913.0,28753801,Age ≥40 Years Associated Adverse Outcome Metastatic Germ Despite Appropriate Intended Chemotherapy,4,0.013559322033898305
Pan-urologic cancer genomic subtypes that transcend tissue of origin.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2017-08-04,"Urologic cancers include cancers of the bladder, kidney, prostate, and testes, with common molecular features spanning different types. Here, we show that 1954 urologic cancers can be classified into nine major genomic subtypes, on the basis of multidimensional and comprehensive molecular characterization (including DNA methylation and copy number, and RNA and protein expression). Tissue dominant effects are first removed computationally in order to define these subtypes, which reveal common processes-reflecting in part tumor microenvironmental influences-driving cellular behavior across tumor lineages. Six of the subtypes feature a mixture of represented cancer types as defined by tissue or cell of origin. Differences in patient survival and in the manifestation of specific pathways-including hypoxia, metabolism, NRF2-ARE, Hippo, and immune checkpoint-can further distinguish the subtypes. Immune checkpoint markers and molecular signatures of macrophages and T cell infiltrates are relatively high within distinct subsets of each cancer type studied. The pan-urologic cancer genomic subtypes would facilitate information sharing involving therapeutic implications between tissue-oriented domains.Urological cancers have disparate tissues and cells of origin but share many molecular features.

Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2017-08-14,"The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins comprises four members-BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis-specific isoform BRDT-that largely function as transcriptional coactivators and play critical roles in various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion. BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3<sup>SPOP</sup> earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.",Journal Article,890.0,62.0,bromodomain extraterminal BET family comprises members-BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 testis-specific isoform BRDT-that largely function transcriptional coactivators play critical roles cellular processes including cycle apoptosis migration invasion BET enhance oncogenic functions major drivers elevating expression drivers c-Myc leukemia promoting transcriptional activities oncogenic factors AR ERG prostate Pathologically BET frequently overexpressed clinically linked types human pursued attractive therapeutic targets selective inhibition patients end number bromodomain inhibitors including JQ1 I-BET developed shown promising outcomes early clinical trials resistance BET inhibitors documented preclinical models molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance largely unknown report cullin-3 sup SPOP /sup earmarks BET including BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 ubiquitination-mediated degradation Pathologically prostate cancer-associated SPOP fail interact promote degradation BET leading elevated abundance SPOP-mutant prostate prostate lines organoids derived individuals harboring SPOP resistant BET-inhibitor-induced growth arrest apoptosis elucidate tumor-suppressor role SPOP prostate acts negative regulator BET stability provide molecular mechanism resistance BET inhibitors individuals prostate bearing SPOP,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 7904, 2, 27556, 4661, 607, 1, 652, 6704, 294, 1684, 22827, 25692, 8141, 2, 3, 7697, 112, 3995, 50525, 17, 1733, 343, 22, 1431, 17636, 2, 1343, 740, 1790, 4, 747, 763, 1849, 141, 3, 31, 417, 351, 1381, 2, 578, 4661, 652, 1304, 3, 1302, 1681, 1, 458, 12, 3391, 20, 16877, 3, 55, 1, 46, 3391, 225, 22, 256, 1371, 4, 15, 20, 2388, 3, 1431, 2042, 1, 1302, 130, 225, 22, 754, 2, 3032, 4, 12, 2998, 4661, 652, 32, 746, 1711, 2, 32, 505, 1199, 6, 747, 630, 1, 171, 12, 491, 32, 673, 486, 5299, 22, 3059, 189, 637, 9, 1094, 297, 4, 7, 5, 12, 6, 26, 396, 8, 207, 1, 7904, 222, 141, 10635, 2, 70, 4661, 47, 85, 276, 2, 47, 443, 721, 123, 4, 191, 38, 143, 242, 251, 6, 4661, 222, 71, 85, 1405, 4, 693, 274, 3, 219, 483, 1181, 1294, 251, 32, 1733, 860, 467, 21, 414, 17, 19546, 27, 172, 10636, 172, 71013, 4661, 652, 141, 22827, 25692, 2, 8141, 9, 8258, 517, 2373, 2998, 12, 41, 10636, 3423, 4373, 6, 4491, 5, 2, 1617, 3, 2373, 1, 4661, 652, 1049, 6, 136, 804, 4778, 4, 10636, 620, 12, 22, 8, 757, 12, 31, 285, 2, 8018, 526, 29, 869, 2105, 10636, 138, 32, 80, 436, 6, 4661, 230, 277, 31, 129, 1854, 2, 351, 673, 114, 99, 3061, 3, 30, 1245, 200, 1, 10636, 4, 12, 4, 92, 192, 4459, 22, 8, 199, 2452, 1, 4661, 178, 2769, 2, 120, 377, 8, 219, 670, 9, 251, 6, 4661, 222, 4, 869, 5, 12, 1894, 10636, 138]",1802.0,28805820,Prostate cancer-associated SPOP confer resistance BET inhibitors stabilization BRD4,71,0.24067796610169492

Immunother.,2017-10-01,"Effective induction of antitumor T cells is a pivotal goal of cancer immunotherapy. To this end, lentiviral vectors (LV) are uniquely poised to directly prime CD8 T-cell responses via transduction of dendritic cells in vivo and have shown promise as active cancer therapeutics in preclinical tumor models. However, until now, significant barriers related to production and regulation have prevented their widespread use in the clinic. We developed LV305, a dendritic cell-targeting, integration-deficient, replication incompetent LV from the ZVex platform, encoding the full-length cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1. LV305 is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and 2 trials in metastatic recurrent cancer patients with NY-ESO-1 positive solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-L1. Here we report on the first patient treated with LV305, a young woman with metastatic, recurrent, therapy-refractive NY-ESO-1 synovial sarcoma. The patient developed a robust NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell response after 3 intradermal injections with LV305, and subsequently over 85% disease regression that is continuing for >2.5 years posttherapy. No adverse events >grade 2 occurred.

T cells presenting viral antigens or autoantigens induce cytotoxic T cell anergy.,JCI insight,JCI Insight,2017-11-02,"In the course of modeling the naturally occurring tumor immunity seen in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), we discovered an unexpectedly high threshold for breaking CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) tolerance to the PCD autoantigen, CDR2. While CDR2 expression was previously found to be strictly restricted to immune-privileged cells (cerebellum, testes, and tumors), unexpectedly we have found that T cells also express CDR2. This expression underlies inhibition of CTL activation; CTLs that respond to epithelial cells expressing CDR2 fail to respond to T cells expressing CDR2. This was a general phenomenon, as T cells presenting influenza (flu) antigen also fail to activate otherwise potent flu-specific CTLs either in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, transfer of flu peptide-pulsed T cells into flu-infected mice inhibits endogenous flu-specific CTLs. Our finding that T cells serve as a site of immune privilege, inhibiting effector CTL function, uncovers an autorepressive loop with general biologic and clinical relevance.",Journal Article,810.0,0.0,course modeling naturally occurring immunity seen patients paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration PCD discovered unexpectedly high threshold breaking CD8+ cytotoxic CTL tolerance PCD autoantigen CDR2 CDR2 expression previously strictly restricted immune-privileged cerebellum testes unexpectedly express CDR2 expression underlies inhibition CTL activation CTLs respond epithelial expressing CDR2 fail respond expressing CDR2 general phenomenon presenting influenza flu antigen fail activate potent flu-specific CTLs vitro vivo transfer flu peptide-pulsed flu-infected mice inhibits endogenous flu-specific CTLs finding serve site immune privilege inhibiting effector CTL function uncovers autorepressive loop general biologic clinical relevance,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 3, 906, 1, 2057, 3, 6045, 1821, 30, 1604, 527, 4, 7, 5, 6544, 8103, 11298, 19032, 21, 2747, 35, 6016, 64, 2390, 9, 13869, 968, 759, 102, 31, 3872, 2614, 6, 3, 19032, 33380, 21481, 369, 21481, 55, 10, 373, 204, 6, 40, 10395, 2016, 6, 250, 24419, 37, 13002, 13100, 2, 57, 6016, 21, 47, 204, 17, 102, 37, 120, 1669, 21481, 26, 55, 10702, 297, 1, 3872, 363, 5416, 17, 1892, 6, 701, 37, 1046, 21481, 4373, 6, 1892, 6, 102, 37, 1046, 21481, 26, 10, 8, 1083, 3936, 22, 102, 37, 1656, 7219, 5119, 448, 120, 4373, 6, 2977, 2632, 1157, 5119, 112, 5416, 361, 4, 439, 15, 4, 386, 1393, 2602, 1, 5119, 1389, 5695, 102, 37, 237, 5119, 3369, 399, 1576, 2682, 5119, 112, 5416, 114, 1567, 17, 102, 37, 1833, 22, 8, 606, 1, 250, 25067, 2062, 2070, 3872, 343, 18562, 35, 71471, 4432, 5, 1083, 1283, 2, 38, 2088]",1024.0,29093272,presenting viral antigens autoantigens induce cytotoxic anergy,7,0.023728813559322035
Treatment of CD30-Expressing Germ Cell Tumors and Sex Cord Stromal Tumors with Brentuximab Vedotin: Identification and Report of Seven Cases.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2017-12-08,"Cytotoxic therapy for relapsed and refractory germ cell tumors or metastatic sex cord stromal tumors is rarely effective and is often accompanied by high adverse event rates. Expression of CD30 has been observed in testicular cancers, and patients with CD30-expressing embryonal carcinomas have worse progression-free survival and overall survival than those with CD30-negative tumors. The objective of this study (NCT01461538) was to characterize the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in patients with CD30-expressing nonlymphomatous malignancies. Enrolled patients included seven patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors or metastatic sex cord stromal tumors described in this case series. Forty patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors, metastatic sex cord stromal tumors, or testicular tumors were screened for CD30 expression; 14 patients had tumors that expressed CD30. Seven patients with CD30-expressing testicular cancer were enrolled in the treatment study: five patients with germ cell tumors, one patient with a Leydig cell tumor, and one patient with a Sertoli cell tumor. Patients were treated with brentuximab vedotin at initial doses of 1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Response assessments were performed at cycles 2 and 4 and every 4 cycles thereafter while the patient was receiving treatment. Two of seven patients achieved an objective response, including one durable complete response and one partial response at a single time point. Both responding patients had germ cell tumors. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin was generally well tolerated. Treatment of relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors with brentuximab vedotin can induce durable responses with a manageable toxicity profile. This case series of seven patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-expressing germ cell tumors (GCTs) or sex cord stromal tumors demonstrates that brentuximab vedotin has activity against GCTs and is well tolerated in heavily pretreated patients with these aggressive tumor types. One patient achieved a complete response that has been durable for almost 4 years since the discontinuation of treatment with brentuximab vedotin. Therefore, brentuximab vedotin may be a valuable option for physicians who care for this difficult-to-treat patient population.",Case Reports,774.0,5.0,Cytotoxic therapy relapsed refractory germ metastatic sex cord stromal rarely effective accompanied high adverse event rates Expression CD30 observed testicular patients CD30-expressing embryonal carcinomas worse progression-free survival overall survival CD30-negative objective NCT01461538 characterize antitumor activity brentuximab vedotin patients CD30-expressing nonlymphomatous malignancies Enrolled patients included seven patients relapsed refractory germ metastatic sex cord stromal described case series patients relapsed refractory germ metastatic sex cord stromal testicular screened CD30 expression 14 patients expressed CD30 Seven patients CD30-expressing testicular enrolled treatment patients germ patient Leydig patient Sertoli Patients treated brentuximab vedotin initial doses 1.8 2.4 mg/kg 3 weeks Response assessments performed cycles 2 4 4 cycles patient receiving treatment seven patients achieved objective response including durable complete response partial response single time point responding patients germ Treatment brentuximab vedotin generally tolerated Treatment relapsed refractory germ brentuximab vedotin induce durable responses manageable toxicity profile case series seven patients relapsed refractory CD30-expressing germ GCTs sex cord stromal demonstrates brentuximab vedotin activity GCTs tolerated heavily pretreated patients aggressive types patient achieved complete response durable 4 years discontinuation treatment brentuximab vedotin brentuximab vedotin valuable option physicians care difficult-to-treat patient population,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[759, 36, 9, 591, 2, 430, 2280, 31, 57, 15, 113, 1035, 1885, 1126, 57, 16, 2416, 323, 2, 16, 629, 2756, 20, 64, 290, 774, 151, 55, 1, 4541, 71, 85, 164, 4, 163, 2, 7, 5, 4541, 1046, 5239, 826, 47, 639, 91, 115, 25, 2, 63, 25, 76, 135, 5, 4541, 199, 57, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 71761, 10, 6, 1507, 3, 579, 128, 1, 4511, 4442, 4, 7, 5, 4541, 1046, 71762, 441, 346, 7, 159, 648, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 2280, 31, 57, 15, 113, 1035, 1885, 1126, 57, 1027, 4, 26, 473, 988, 1213, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 2280, 31, 57, 113, 1035, 1885, 1126, 57, 15, 57, 11, 2261, 9, 4541, 55, 213, 7, 42, 57, 17, 570, 4541, 648, 7, 5, 4541, 1046, 12, 11, 346, 4, 3, 24, 45, 365, 7, 5, 2280, 31, 57, 104, 69, 5, 8, 23505, 31, 30, 2, 104, 69, 5, 8, 31032, 31, 30, 7, 11, 73, 5, 4511, 4442, 28, 388, 415, 1, 14, 66, 15, 18, 39, 81, 503, 454, 27, 244, 51, 2182, 11, 173, 28, 410, 18, 2, 39, 2, 454, 39, 410, 3972, 369, 3, 69, 10, 357, 24, 100, 1, 648, 7, 513, 35, 461, 51, 141, 104, 1480, 236, 51, 2, 104, 450, 51, 28, 8, 226, 98, 741, 110, 3261, 7, 42, 2280, 31, 57, 24, 5, 4511, 4442, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 24, 1, 591, 15, 430, 2280, 31, 57, 5, 4511, 4442, 122, 1290, 1480, 253, 5, 8, 2808, 155, 800, 26, 473, 988, 1, 648, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 4541, 1046, 2280, 31, 57, 5553, 15, 1035, 1885, 1126, 57, 1902, 17, 4511, 4442, 71, 128, 480, 5553, 2, 16, 149, 421, 4, 2447, 2193, 7, 5, 46, 571, 30, 630, 104, 69, 513, 8, 236, 51, 17, 71, 85, 1480, 9, 2214, 39, 60, 1192, 3, 2007, 1, 24, 5, 4511, 4442, 673, 4511, 4442, 68, 40, 8, 2926, 1501, 9, 1261, 54, 165, 9, 26, 1740, 6, 943, 69, 266]",2239.0,29222199,Treatment CD30-Expressing Germ Sex Cord Stromal Brentuximab Vedotin Identification Report Seven Cases,0,0.0
Recurrent leiomyosarcoma scrotum: An important differential in scrotal masses.,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,,"Soft tissue sarcomas of the genitourinary tract are rare. Paratesticular sarcomas are extremely rare with majority of scrotal masses localizing to the testis and being neoplastic in nature. Paratesticular leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) are located in the spermatic cord, epididymis, or scrotum. However, their location in the scrotal skin or subcutaneous tissue is extremely rare.

Tumor-associated autoantibodies as early detection markers for ovarian cancer? A prospective evaluation.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2018-03-08,"Immuno-proteomic screening has identified several tumor-associated autoantibodies (AAb) that may have diagnostic capacity for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, with AAbs to P53 proteins and cancer-testis antigens (CTAGs) as prominent examples. However, the early detection potential of these AAbs has been insufficiently explored in prospective studies. We performed ELISA measurements of AAbs to CTAG1A, CTAG2, P53 and NUDT11 proteins, for 194 patients with ovarian cancer and 705 matched controls from the European EPIC cohort, using serum samples collected up to 36 months prior to diagnosis under usual care. CA125 was measured using electrochemo-luminiscence. Diagnostic discrimination statistics were calculated by strata of lead-time between blood collection and diagnosis. With lead times ≤6 months, ovarian cancer detection sensitivity at 0.98 specificity (SE98) varied from 0.19 [95% CI 0.08-0.40] for CTAG1A, CTAG2 and NUDT1 to 0.23 [0.10-0.44] for P53 (0.33 [0.11-0.68] for high-grade serous tumors). However, at longer lead-times, the ability of these AAb markers to distinguish future ovarian cancer cases from controls declined rapidly; at lead times >1 year, SE98 estimates were close to zero (all invasive cases, range: 0.01-0.11). Compared to CA125 alone, combined logistic regression scores of AAbs and CA125 did not improve detection sensitivity at equal level of specificity. The added value of these selected AAbs as markers for ovarian cancer beyond CA125 for early detection is therefore limited.",Journal Article,684.0,5.0,Immuno-proteomic screening identified tumor-associated autoantibodies AAb diagnostic capacity invasive epithelial ovarian AAbs P53 cancer-testis antigens CTAGs prominent examples early detection potential AAbs insufficiently explored prospective studies performed ELISA measurements AAbs CTAG1A CTAG2 P53 NUDT11 194 patients ovarian 705 matched controls European EPIC cohort serum collected 36 months prior diagnosis usual care CA125 measured electrochemo-luminiscence Diagnostic discrimination statistics calculated strata lead-time blood collection diagnosis lead times ≤6 months ovarian detection sensitivity 0.98 specificity SE98 varied 0.19 95 CI 0.08-0.40 CTAG1A CTAG2 NUDT1 0.23 0.10-0.44 P53 0.33 0.11-0.68 high-grade serous longer lead-times ability AAb markers distinguish future ovarian cases controls declined rapidly lead times 1 year SE98 estimates close zero invasive cases range 0.01-0.11 Compared CA125 combined logistic regression scores AAbs CA125 improve detection sensitivity equal level specificity added value selected AAbs markers ovarian CA125 early detection limited,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7644, 3784, 453, 71, 108, 392, 30, 41, 7613, 12434, 17, 68, 47, 752, 2162, 9, 416, 701, 12, 5, 24184, 6, 624, 652, 2, 12, 7697, 1575, 72242, 22, 3689, 4416, 137, 3, 191, 638, 174, 1, 46, 24184, 71, 85, 17133, 1443, 4, 482, 94, 21, 173, 3664, 1685, 1, 24184, 6, 50889, 31845, 624, 2, 35394, 652, 9, 5434, 7, 5, 12, 2, 11303, 655, 535, 29, 3, 1865, 8995, 180, 75, 524, 347, 786, 126, 6, 511, 53, 324, 6, 147, 669, 3521, 165, 3188, 10, 644, 75, 72243, 72244, 752, 3520, 3065, 11, 981, 20, 5758, 1, 1122, 98, 59, 315, 2442, 2, 147, 5, 1122, 1072, 10020, 53, 12, 638, 485, 28, 13, 1096, 1121, 50890, 2051, 29, 13, 326, 48, 58, 13, 1592, 13, 327, 9, 50889, 31845, 2, 72245, 6, 13, 382, 13, 79, 13, 584, 9, 624, 13, 466, 13, 175, 13, 806, 9, 64, 88, 1744, 57, 137, 28, 589, 1122, 1072, 3, 801, 1, 46, 12434, 525, 6, 3081, 508, 12, 140, 29, 535, 3054, 1755, 28, 1122, 1072, 14, 111, 50890, 1423, 11, 2336, 6, 5115, 62, 416, 140, 184, 13, 355, 13, 175, 72, 6, 3188, 279, 397, 812, 320, 703, 1, 24184, 2, 3188, 205, 44, 401, 638, 485, 28, 2997, 301, 1, 1121, 3, 1953, 549, 1, 46, 715, 24184, 22, 525, 9, 12, 1654, 3188, 9, 191, 638, 16, 673, 383]",1440.0,29473162,Tumor-associated autoantibodies early detection markers ovarian prospective evaluation,0,0.0
Right Ventricular Heart Failure from a Cardiac Yolk Sac Tumor.,The American journal of case reports,Am J Case Rep,2018-03-02,"BACKGROUND Cardiac involvement by a malignant tumor is rare. However, this is a case of right heart failure due to cardiac metastasis from a yolk sac tumor. Although a few case reports of cardiac metastasis from yolk sac tumors have been published, to our knowledge this is the first instance of multiple metastases to the right ventricular of yolk sac tumor in an adult male. CASE REPORT The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of testicular cancer that presented with dyspnea on exertion. He was found to have two large right sided intracardiac masses on echocardiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained to further investigate these masses. Right ventricular function was decreased and concern for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction was present. The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) for resection of the cardiac masses. Pathology revealed the masses to be yolk sac tumors. Despite urgent resection of the tumors, the patient deteriorated clinically, ultimately succumbing to heart failure. CONCLUSIONS This unique presentation of a yolk sac tumor emphasizes the need to keep a broad differential and complete a thorough workup for any cardiac mass. Early diagnosis and treatment of intra-cardiac masses is imperative due to their high rates of mortality. Albeit an uncommon etiology for heart failure, germ cell tumors can potentially metastasize to the heart and present with such a clinical picture.",Case Reports,690.0,0.0,BACKGROUND Cardiac involvement malignant rare case right heart failure cardiac metastasis yolk sac case reports cardiac metastasis yolk sac published knowledge instance multiple metastases right ventricular yolk sac adult male CASE REPORT patient 46-year-old male history testicular presented dyspnea exertion large right sided intracardiac masses echocardiography Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI obtained investigate masses Right ventricular function decreased concern right ventricular outflow tract RVOT obstruction present patient taken operating room resection cardiac masses Pathology revealed masses yolk sac Despite urgent resection patient deteriorated clinically ultimately succumbing heart failure CONCLUSIONS unique presentation yolk sac emphasizes need broad differential complete thorough workup cardiac mass Early diagnosis treatment intra-cardiac masses imperative high rates mortality Albeit uncommon etiology heart failure germ potentially metastasize heart present clinical picture,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[2426, 799, 20, 8, 393, 30, 16, 622, 137, 26, 16, 8, 473, 1, 1913, 496, 520, 6, 278, 29, 8, 13078, 7948, 30, 242, 8, 1021, 473, 1198, 1, 278, 29, 13078, 7948, 57, 47, 85, 983, 6, 114, 922, 26, 16, 3, 157, 10642, 1, 232, 196, 6, 3, 1913, 4028, 1, 13078, 7948, 30, 4, 35, 780, 1045, 473, 414, 3, 69, 16, 8, 641, 111, 1095, 1045, 5, 8, 532, 1, 12, 17, 917, 5, 2923, 23, 15784, 3174, 10, 204, 6, 47, 100, 375, 1913, 1689, 17294, 2692, 23, 9484, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 10, 683, 6, 195, 963, 46, 2692, 1913, 4028, 343, 10, 340, 2, 2893, 9, 1913, 4028, 21039, 1696, 72298, 3191, 10, 364, 3, 69, 10, 1633, 6, 3, 2584, 4698, 15, 9, 170, 1, 3, 2692, 1117, 553, 3, 2692, 6, 40, 13078, 7948, 57, 550, 5013, 170, 1, 3, 57, 3, 69, 16644, 505, 2050, 28013, 6, 496, 2130, 26, 991, 1031, 1, 8, 13078, 7948, 30, 7519, 3, 594, 6, 10399, 8, 2094, 1777, 2, 236, 8, 5506, 4755, 9, 500, 782, 191, 147, 2, 24, 1, 2392, 13514, 2692, 16, 6305, 520, 6, 136, 64, 151, 1, 282, 5993, 35, 2052, 2855, 9, 496, 2280, 31, 57, 122, 751, 5769, 6, 3, 2, 364, 5, 225, 8, 38, 8951]",1356.0,29497026,Right Ventricular Heart Failure Cardiac Yolk Sac,0,0.0
Clinical and Genetic Risk Factors for Adverse Metabolic Outcomes in North American Testicular Cancer Survivors.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2018-03-01,"<b>Background:</b> Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), with metabolic syndrome (MetS) an established risk factor. No study has addressed clinical and genetic MetS risk factors in North American TCS. <b>Patients and Methods:</b> TCS were aged <55 years at diagnosis and received first-line chemotherapy. Patients underwent physical examination, and had lipid panels, testosterone, and soluble cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) evaluated. A single nucleotide polymorphism in rs523349 (5-α-reductase gene, <i>SRD5A2</i>), recently implicated in MetS risk, was genotyped. Using standard criteria, MetS was defined as ≥3 of the following: hypertension, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, and diabetes. Matched controls were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. <b>Results:</b> We evaluated 486 TCS (median age, 38.1 years). TCS had a higher prevalence of hypertension versus controls (43.2% vs 30.7%; <i>P</i><.001) but were less likely to have decreased HDL levels (23.7% vs 34.8%; <i>P</i><.001) or abdominal obesity (28.2% vs 40.1%; <i>P</i><.001). Overall MetS frequency was similar in TCS and controls (21.0% vs 22.4%; <i>P</i>=.59), did not differ by treatment (<i>P</i>=.20), and was not related to rs523349 (<i>P</i>=.61). For other CVD risk factors, TCS were significantly more likely to have elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (17.7% vs 9.3%; <i>P</i><.001), total cholesterol levels (26.3% vs 11.1%; <i>P</i><.001), and body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (75.1% vs 69.1%; <i>P</i>=.04). On multivariate analysis, age at evaluation (<i>P</i><.001), testosterone level ≤3.0 ng/mL (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; <i>P</i>=.005), and elevated sICAM-1 level (OR<sub>highest vs lowest quartile</sub>, 3.58; <i>P</i>=.001) were significantly associated with MetS. <b>Conclusions and Recommendations:</b> Metabolic abnormalities in TCS are characterized by hypertension and increased LDL and total cholesterol levels but lower rates of decreased HDL levels and abdominal obesity, signifying possible shifts in fat distribution and fat metabolism. These changes are accompanied by hypogonadism and inflammation. TCS have a high prevalence of CVD risk factors that may not be entirely captured by standard MetS criteria.

Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Among Testicular Cancer Survivors After Modern Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy: Application of the Framingham Risk Score.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2018-02-05,"Testicular cancer survivors (TCSs) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT). Identifying at-risk survivors would allow early intervention, but risk prediction tools such as the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) have not been applied to TCSs given modern chemotherapy. TCSs > 1 year post-CBCT were evaluated. Associations between FRS and clinical, socioeconomic, and lifestyle measures and treatment regimen (4 cycles, etoposide and cisplatin [EP × 4]); 3 or 4 cycles, bleomycin plus EP (BEP × 3, BEP × 4) were analyzed with general linear multivariable models. Controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were matched 1:1 to TCSs by age, race, and education with differences in mean FRS evaluated with 2-sided t tests. Of 787 TCSs (median age, 37.3 years; median follow-up, 4.2 years), 284, 342, and 161 received EP × 4, BEP × 3, or BEP × 4, respectively. TCSs had higher median systolic blood pressure (126 vs. 119 mm Hg; P < .001), but fewer were smokers (8.4% vs. 28.2%; P < .001) than controls. In multivariable analysis, no significant differences in FRS between EP × 4, BEP × 3, and BEP × 4 were observed, but less than college education (P < .001) and lack of vigorous exercise (P = .006) were associated with higher FRS.

Exome chip analyses identify genes affecting mortality after HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2018-04-02,"Although survival outcomes have significantly improved, up to 40% of patients die within 1 year of HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). To identify non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after BMT, we performed the first exome-wide association study in the DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts using the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip. This study includes 2473 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome and 2221 10/10 HLA-matched donors treated from 2000 to 2011. Single-variant and gene-level analyses were performed on overall survival (OS), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), and disease-related mortality (DRM). Genotype mismatches between recipients and donors in a rare nonsynonymous variant of testis-expressed gene <i>TEX38</i> significantly increased risk of TRM, which was more dramatic when either the recipient or donor was female. Using the SKAT-O test to evaluate gene-level effects, variant genotypes of <i>OR51D1</i> in recipients were significantly associated with OS and TRM. In donors, 4 (<i>ALPP</i>, <i>EMID1</i>, <i>SLC44A5</i>, <i>LRP1</i>), 1 (<i>HHAT</i>), and 2 genes (<i>LYZL4</i>, <i>NT5E</i>) were significantly associated with OS, TRM, and DRM, respectively. Inspection of NT5E crystal structures showed 4 of the associated variants affected the enzyme structure and likely decreased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Further confirmation of these findings and additional functional studies may provide individualized risk prediction and prognosis, as well as alternative donor selection strategies.",Journal Article,659.0,4.0,survival outcomes significantly improved 40 patients die 1 year HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood marrow transplantation BMT identify non-HLA genetic contributors mortality BMT performed exome-wide association DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts Illumina HumanExome BeadChip includes 2473 patients acute myeloid leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome 2221 10/10 HLA-matched donors treated 2000 2011 Single-variant gene-level performed overall survival OS transplantation-related mortality TRM disease-related mortality DRM Genotype mismatches recipients donors rare nonsynonymous testis-expressed TEX38 /i significantly increased risk TRM dramatic recipient donor female SKAT-O test evaluate gene-level effects genotypes OR51D1 /i recipients significantly associated OS TRM donors 4 ALPP /i EMID1 /i SLC44A5 /i LRP1 /i 1 HHAT /i 2 LYZL4 /i NT5E /i significantly associated OS TRM DRM respectively Inspection NT5E crystal structures showed 4 associated affected enzyme structure likely decreased catalytic efficiency enzyme confirmation findings additional functional studies provide individualized risk prediction prognosis alternative donor selection strategies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 25, 123, 47, 97, 231, 126, 6, 327, 1, 7, 3384, 262, 14, 111, 1, 1160, 655, 2092, 1488, 315, 2, 581, 497, 4611, 6, 255, 220, 1160, 336, 9680, 6, 282, 50, 4611, 21, 173, 3, 157, 2865, 1019, 248, 45, 4, 3, 1574, 4611, 736, 75, 3, 7457, 72501, 16111, 26, 45, 1920, 39392, 7, 5, 286, 533, 286, 1275, 15, 681, 2, 72502, 79, 79, 1160, 655, 2344, 73, 29, 1081, 6, 1132, 226, 1142, 2, 145, 301, 318, 11, 173, 23, 63, 25, 118, 497, 139, 282, 5064, 2, 34, 139, 282, 26786, 1183, 11828, 59, 2190, 2, 2344, 4, 8, 622, 10233, 1142, 1, 7697, 570, 145, 70, 72503, 70, 97, 101, 43, 1, 5064, 92, 10, 80, 3079, 198, 361, 3, 5783, 15, 1488, 10, 1061, 75, 3, 36265, 1990, 412, 6, 376, 145, 301, 176, 1142, 2071, 1, 70, 72504, 70, 4, 2190, 11, 97, 41, 5, 118, 2, 5064, 4, 2344, 39, 70, 72505, 70, 70, 72506, 70, 70, 72507, 70, 70, 16997, 70, 14, 70, 72508, 70, 2, 18, 214, 70, 72509, 70, 70, 50975, 70, 11, 97, 41, 5, 118, 5064, 2, 26786, 106, 11746, 1, 50975, 9197, 2414, 224, 39, 1, 3, 41, 839, 1424, 3, 1644, 2772, 2, 322, 340, 3, 4784, 2904, 1, 3, 1644, 195, 3551, 1, 46, 272, 2, 402, 583, 94, 68, 377, 2596, 43, 1590, 2, 356, 22, 149, 22, 1091, 1488, 881, 422]",1517.0,29610366,Exome chip identify affecting mortality HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood marrow transplantation,0,0.0
Cumulative Burden of Morbidity Among Testicular Cancer Survivors After Standard Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy: A Multi-Institutional Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-04-04,"Purpose In this multicenter study, we evaluated the cumulative burden of morbidity (CBM) among > 1,200 testicular cancer survivors and applied factor analysis to determine the co-occurrence of adverse health outcomes (AHOs). Patients and Methods Participants were ≤ 55 years of age at diagnosis, finished first-line chemotherapy ≥ 1 year previously, completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and underwent physical examination. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. A CBM score encompassed the number and severity of AHOs, with ordinal logistic regression used to assess associations with exposures. Nonlinear factor analysis and the nonparametric dimensionality evaluation to enumerate contributing traits procedure determined which AHOs co-occurred. Results Among 1,214 participants, approximately 20% had a high (15%) or very high/severe (4.1%) CBM score, whereas approximately 80% scored medium (30%) or low/very low (47%). Increased risks of higher scores were associated with four cycles of either ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.71) or bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.98), older attained age (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.26), current disability leave (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.57 to 7.95), less than a college education (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.87), and current or former smoking (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63). CBM score did not differ after either chemotherapy regimen ( P = .36). Asian race (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.72) and vigorous exercise (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89) were protective. Variable clustering analyses identified six significant AHO clusters (χ<sup>2</sup> P < .001): hearing loss/damage, tinnitus (OR, 16.3); hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes (OR, 9.8); neuropathy, pain, Raynaud phenomenon (OR, 5.5); cardiovascular and related conditions (OR, 5.0); thyroid disease, erectile dysfunction (OR, 4.2); and depression/anxiety, hypogonadism (OR, 2.8).

"Improving Male Reproductive Health After Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer: Progress and Future Directions for Survivorship Research.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-06-06,"Reproductive health is a common concern and often a source of distress for male childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. Clinical and epidemiologic research in survivor populations has identified alkylating agent chemotherapy, testicular radiation, and surgery or radiation to the genitourinary organs, lower spine, or the hypothalamic-pituitary region as risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes, including impaired spermatogenesis, testosterone insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction. Much of the research on male survivors has focused on the outcome of fertility, using spermatogenesis, serum gonadotropins, and paternity as the measures. However, these studies often fail to account for the clinically relevant but difficult-to-quantify aspects of fertility such as sexual function, cancer-related delayed psychosocial development, medical comorbidities, and socioeconomic concerns. Clinical and basic science research has made significant contributions to improving reproductive outcomes for survivors, with recent advancements in the areas of fertility preservation, clinical assessment of reproductive function, and treatment of adverse reproductive outcomes.

Integrated Molecular Characterization of Testicular Germ Cell Tumors.,Cell reports,Cell Rep,2018-06-01,"We studied 137 primary testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) using high-dimensional assays of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic features. These tumors exhibited high aneuploidy and a paucity of somatic mutations. Somatic mutation of only three genes achieved significance-KIT, KRAS, and NRAS-exclusively in samples with seminoma components. Integrated analyses identified distinct molecular patterns that characterized the major recognized histologic subtypes of TGCT: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. Striking differences in global DNA methylation and microRNA expression between histology subtypes highlight a likely role of epigenomic processes in determining histologic fates in TGCTs. We also identified a subset of pure seminomas defined by KIT mutations, increased immune infiltration, globally demethylated DNA, and decreased KRAS copy number.

Preoperative Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis is an Independent Predictor of Progression-Free Survival.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-06-14,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a useful tool for detecting genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To date, most ctDNA tests have been performed on patients with widely metastatic disease. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (metastases) present unique prognostic and therapeutic challenges. We therefore explored preoperative ctDNA in patients with peritoneal metastases undergoing surgery. Patients referred for surgical resection of peritoneal metastases underwent preoperative blood-derived ctDNA analysis (clinical-grade NGS [68-73 genes]). ctDNA was quantified as the percentage of altered circulating cell-free DNA (% cfDNA). Eighty patients had ctDNA testing: 46 (57.5%) women; median age 55.5 years. The following diagnoses were included: 59 patients (73.8%), appendix cancer; 11 (13.8%), colorectal; five (6.3%), peritoneal mesothelioma; two (2.5%), small bowel; one (1.3%) each of cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian, and testicular cancer. Thirty-one patients (38.8%) had detectable preoperative ctDNA alterations, most frequently in the following genes: TP53 (25.8% of all alterations detected) and KRAS (11.3%). Among 15 patients with tissue DNA NGS, 33.3% also had ctDNA alterations (overall concordance = 96.7%). Patients with high ctDNA quantities (≥ 0.25% cfDNA, n = 25) had a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with lower ctDNA quantities (n = 55; 7.8 vs. 15.0 months; hazard ratio 3.23, 95% confidence interval 1.43-7.28, p = 0.005 univariate, p = 0.044 multivariate).

Long term impact of CTLA4 blockade immunotherapy on regulatory and effector immune responses in patients with melanoma.,Journal of translational medicine,J Transl Med,2018-07-04,"We previously reported early on-treatment significant modulation in circulating regulatory T cell (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and antigen-specific type I CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that correlated with clinical outcome in regionally advanced melanoma patients treated with neoadjuvant ipilimumab. Here, we investigated the long term immunologic impact of CTLA4 blockade. Patients were treated with ipilimumab given at 10 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 2 doses bracketing surgery. Blood specimens were collected at baseline and during treatment for up to 9 months. We tested immune responses at 3, 6, and 9 months utilizing multicolor flow cytometry. We compared frequencies of circulating Treg and MDSC on-study to baseline levels, as well as frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific to shared tumor-associated antigens (Gp-100, MART-1, NY-ESO-1). Levels of Treg significantly increased when measured at 6 weeks following ipilimumab but returned to baseline by 3 months, with no significant difference in Treg levels between relapsed and relapse-free groups at 3, 6 or 9 months. However, lower baseline levels of circulating Treg (CD4+CD25hi+CD39+) were significantly associated with better relapse free survival (RFS) (p = 0.04). Levels of circulating monocytic HLA-DR+/loCD14+ MDSC were lower at baseline in the relapse-free group and further decreased at 6 weeks, though the differences did not reach statistical significance including measurements at 3, 6 or 9 months. We detected evidence of type I (interferon-γ producing), activated (CD69+) CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cell immunity against cancer-testis (NY-ESO-1) as well as melanocytic lineage (MART-1, gp100) antigens in the absence of therapeutic vaccination. These responses were significantly boosted at 6 weeks and persisted at 3, 6 and 9 months following the initiation of ipilimumab. Lower Treg levels at baseline are significantly associated with RFS and increased Treg frequency after CTLA4 blockade was only transient. Lower MDSC was also associated with RFS and MDSC levels were further decreased after ipilimumab. Tumor specific effector immune responses are boosted with CTLA4 blockade and tend to be durable.

Molecular profiling reveals immunogenic cues in anaplastic large cell lymphomas with <i>DUSP22</i> rearrangements.,Blood,Blood,2018-08-09,"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are CD30-positive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas broadly segregated into ALK-positive and ALK-negative types. Although ALK-positive ALCLs consistently bear rearrangements of the <i>ALK</i> tyrosine kinase gene, ALK-negative ALCLs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. About 30% of ALK-negative ALCLs have rearrangements of <i>DUSP22</i> and have excellent long-term outcomes with standard therapy. To better understand this group of tumors, we evaluated their molecular signature using gene expression profiling. <i>DUSP22-</i>rearranged ALCLs belonged to a distinct subset of ALCLs that lacked expression of genes associated with JAK-STAT3 signaling, a pathway contributing to growth in the majority of ALCLs. Reverse-phase protein array and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the lack of activated STAT3 in <i>DUSP22-</i>rearranged ALCLs. <i>DUSP22-</i>rearranged ALCLs also overexpressed immunogenic cancer-testis antigen (CTA) genes and showed marked DNA hypomethylation by reduced representation bisulfate sequencing and DNA methylation arrays. Pharmacologic DNA demethylation in ALCL cells recapitulated the overexpression of CTAs and other DUSP22 signature genes. In addition, <i>DUSP22-</i>rearranged ALCLs minimally expressed PD-L1 compared with other ALCLs, but showed high expression of the costimulatory gene <i>CD58</i> and HLA class II. Taken together, these findings indicate that <i>DUSP22</i> rearrangements define a molecularly distinct subgroup of ALCLs, and that immunogenic cues related to antigenicity, costimulatory molecule expression, and inactivity of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint likely contribute to their favorable prognosis.

Computational modeling and confirmation of leukemia-associated minor histocompatibility antigens.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-08-01,"T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) mediate both antitumor immunity (graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic stem cell transplant. Identifying mHAs with high allele frequency, tight binding affinity to common HLA molecules, and narrow tissue restriction could enhance immunotherapy against leukemia. Genotyping and HLA allele data from 101 HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) were computationally analyzed to predict both class I and class II mHAs likely to induce either GVL or GVHD. Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted in HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared with HLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater genetic disparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted 14 of 18 previously identified mHAs, with 2 minor antigen mismatches not being contained in the patient cohort, 1 missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of the peptide antigen, and 1 case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptide epitope derived from GRK4, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and testis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandem mass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK4-V were identified by tetramer analysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPs where the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK4-V, suggesting that this antigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen.

Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,2018-02-01,"Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18·0 min (SD 9·5 per case). The Toronto Guidelines provide a highly functional framework that can be used to assign cancer stage at diagnosis using data routinely available in medical records for most childhood cancers. Data on staging have the potential to inform interventions targeting improved diagnosis and survival.

Malignant granular cell tumor: Clinical features and long-term survival.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2018-09-09,"Malignant granular cell tumor GCT (mGCT) has not been well described. We sought to investigate associations between tumor characteristics, treatments and survival. Patients diagnosed with mGCT years 1995-2014 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Descriptive statistics regarding tumor and treatment characteristics were calculated. Chi-square tests determined associations between tumor location and features. Survival analyses included Kaplan-Meier functions and Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR). Of 113 patients included, median age was 54 years and 77.0% were female. Frequent tumor sites included soft tissues (36.3%), ovary/testis (16.8%), and skin (11.5%). Median tumor size was 4.0 cm. Metastases to regional lymph nodes (12.5%) and distant sites (11.4%) occurred. Treatments included surgery (85.0%), radiotherapy (12.4%) and chemotherapy (8.9%). Overall five and 10-year cause-specific survival was 74.3% and 65.2%, respectively.

Arterial elasticity as a risk factor for early cardiovascular disease among testicular cancer survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy: a cross-sectional pilot study.,Vascular health and risk management,Vasc Health Risk Manag,2018-09-10,"Testicular cancer survivors who have received platinum-based chemotherapy are at risk for premature cardiovascular disease. The etiology of this risk is not well understood. This pilot study explores the impact of platinum-based chemotherapy on endothelial function. Testicular cancer survivors <30 years old at the time of diagnosis who received platinum-based chemotherapy between 2002 and 2012, as well as 17 similarly aged male controls, were identified. Consented subjects underwent vascular assessment using the HDI/PulseWave CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System and the Endo-PAT2000 system. Biomarkers and functional test markers were compared among cases, controls, and a group of historical controls using two sided two-sampled <i>t</i>-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Thirteen survivors with a median age of 30.2 years and body mass index of 27.3 were enrolled, along with 17 healthy controls with a median age of 27.1 years and body mass index of 24.8. Median time from chemotherapy was 4.7 (range: 0.8-14) years. There was no statistical difference in reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry ratio between cases and controls (<i>p</i> = 0.574). There was no statistical difference in small or large artery elasticity between cases and controls (<i>p</i> = 0.086) or between cases and historical controls (<i>p</i> = 0.729). There was also no statistical difference in the blood levels of circulating endothelial cells, von Willebrand factor, and vascular cell adhesion molecules. There was a trend toward increased metabolic syndrome in cases (15%) as compared to recruited controls (6%), though this difference was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.565). Testicular cancer survivors have no clinically significant difference in endothelial function compared to controls 4 years after the completion of chemotherapy.

Testicular cancer.,Nature reviews. Disease primers,Nat Rev Dis Primers,2018-10-05,"Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy among men between 14 and 44 years of age, and its incidence has risen over the past two decades in Western countries. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of testicular cancer, for which cryptorchidism is the most common risk factor. Progress has been made in our understanding of the disease since the initial description of carcinoma in situ of the testis in 1972 (now referred to as germ cell neoplasia in situ), which has led to improved treatment options. The combination of surgery and cisplatin-based chemotherapy has resulted in a cure rate of >90% in patients with testicular cancer, although some patients become refractory to chemotherapy or have a late relapse; an improved understanding of the molecular determinants underlying tumour sensitivity and resistance may lead to the development of novel therapies for these patients.

Applying Radiomics to Predict Pathology of Postchemotherapy Retroperitoneal Nodal Masses in Germ Cell Tumors.,JCO clinical cancer informatics,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,2018-12-01,"After chemotherapy, approximately 50% of patients with metastatic testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) who undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissections (RPNLDs) for residual masses have fibrosis. Radiomics uses image processing techniques to extract quantitative textures/features from regions of interest (ROIs) to train a classifier that predicts outcomes. We hypothesized that radiomics would identify patients with a high likelihood of fibrosis who may avoid RPLND. Patients with GCT who had an RPLND for nodal masses > 1 cm after first-line platinum chemotherapy were included. Preoperative contrast-enhanced axial computed tomography images of retroperitoneal ROIs were manually contoured. Radiomics features (n = 153) were used to train a radial basis function support vector machine classifier to discriminate between viable GCT/mature teratoma versus fibrosis. A nested 10-fold cross-validation protocol was used to determine classifier accuracy. Clinical variables/restricted size criteria were used to optimize the classifier. Seventy-seven patients with 102 ROIs were analyzed (GCT, 21; teratoma, 41; fibrosis, 40). The discriminative accuracy of radiomics to identify GCT/teratoma versus fibrosis was 72 ± 2.2% (area under the curve [AUC], 0.74 ± 0.028); sensitivity was 56.2 ± 15.0%, and specificity was 81.9 ± 9.0% ( P = .001). No major predictive differences were identified when data were restricted by varying maximal axial diameters (AUC range, 0.58 ± 0.05 to 0.74 ± 0.03). The prediction algorithm using clinical variables alone identified an AUC of 0.76.

The Microbiome and Genitourinary Cancer: A Collaborative Review.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2019-01-15,"The recent discovery of the existence of a human genitourinary microbiome has led to the investigation of its role in mediating the pathogenesis of genitourinary malignancies, including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, although it is largely recognized that members of the gastrointestinal microbiota are actively involved in drug metabolism, new studies demonstrate additional roles and the potential necessity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in dictating cancer treatment response. To summarize the current evidence of a mechanistic role for the genitourinary and gastrointestinal microbiome in genitourinary cancer initiation and treatment response. We conducted a literature search up to October 2018. Search terms included microbiome, microbiota, urinary microbiome, bladder cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. There is preliminary evidence to implicate the members of the genitourinary microbiota as causative factors or cofactors in genitourinary malignancy. Likewise, the current evidence for gastrointestinal microbes in dictating cancer treatment response is mainly correlative; however, we provide examples where therapeutic agents used for the treatment of genitourinary cancers are affected by the human-associated microbiota, or vice versa. Clinical trials, such as fecal microbiota transplant to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy, are currently underway. The role of the microbiome in genitourinary cancer is an emerging field that merits further studies. Translating microbiome research into clinical action will require incorporation of microbiome surveillance into ongoing and future clinical trials as well as expansion of studies to include metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. This review covers recent evidence that microbial populations that reside in the genitourinary tract-and were previously not known to exist-may influence the development of genitourinary malignancies including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, microbial populations that exist at sites outside of the genitourinary tract, such as those that reside in our gut, may influence cancer development and/or treatment response.",Journal Article,371.0,7.0,recent discovery existence human genitourinary microbiome led investigation role mediating pathogenesis genitourinary malignancies including bladder kidney prostate Furthermore largely recognized members gastrointestinal microbiota actively involved drug metabolism new studies demonstrate additional roles potential necessity gastrointestinal microbiota dictating treatment response summarize current evidence mechanistic role genitourinary gastrointestinal microbiome genitourinary initiation treatment response conducted literature search October 2018 Search terms included microbiome microbiota urinary microbiome bladder urothelial carcinoma renal carcinoma kidney testicular prostate preliminary evidence implicate members genitourinary microbiota causative factors cofactors genitourinary malignancy Likewise current evidence gastrointestinal microbes dictating treatment response mainly correlative provide examples therapeutic agents treatment genitourinary affected human-associated microbiota vice versa Clinical trials fecal microbiota transplant increase efficacy immunotherapy currently underway role microbiome genitourinary emerging field merits studies Translating microbiome research clinical action require incorporation microbiome surveillance ongoing future clinical trials expansion studies include metagenomic sequencing metabolomics review covers recent evidence microbial populations reside genitourinary tract-and previously known exist-may influence development genitourinary malignancies including bladder kidney prostate Furthermore microbial populations exist sites outside genitourinary tract reside gut influence development and/or treatment response,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 435, 1574, 1, 3, 5335, 1, 8, 171, 4109, 7675, 71, 836, 6, 3, 940, 1, 211, 200, 4, 3941, 3, 1384, 1, 4109, 441, 141, 2, 163, 798, 242, 192, 16, 1733, 1904, 17, 1684, 1, 3, 7287, 32, 4489, 646, 4, 234, 1600, 217, 94, 608, 402, 1790, 2, 3, 174, 7378, 1, 3, 7287, 4, 20340, 12, 24, 51, 6, 2479, 3, 291, 241, 1, 8, 2716, 200, 9, 3, 4109, 2, 7675, 4, 4109, 12, 1118, 2, 24, 51, 21, 426, 8, 789, 1901, 126, 6, 2551, 2982, 1901, 1794, 159, 7675, 7287, 1660, 7675, 12, 1472, 134, 31, 134, 12, 12, 2, 12, 125, 16, 1676, 241, 6, 5545, 3, 1684, 1, 3, 4109, 7287, 22, 8088, 130, 15, 14937, 4, 4109, 710, 6269, 3, 291, 241, 9, 14266, 4, 20340, 12, 24, 51, 16, 2615, 3679, 137, 21, 377, 4416, 1257, 189, 183, 95, 9, 3, 24, 1, 4109, 163, 32, 1424, 20, 3, 171, 41, 7287, 15, 10449, 10313, 38, 143, 225, 22, 6784, 7287, 941, 6, 344, 3, 209, 1, 726, 32, 694, 3948, 3, 200, 1, 3, 7675, 4, 4109, 12, 16, 35, 1478, 1067, 17, 4986, 195, 94, 8446, 7675, 389, 237, 38, 1578, 303, 1353, 2838, 1, 7675, 617, 237, 942, 2, 508, 38, 143, 22, 149, 22, 1422, 1, 94, 6, 643, 32165, 615, 2, 11364, 26, 206, 11273, 435, 241, 17, 9138, 1184, 17, 10114, 4, 3, 4109, 1696, 2, 11, 373, 44, 440, 6, 1923, 68, 1054, 3, 193, 1, 4109, 441, 141, 2, 163, 798, 9138, 1184, 17, 1923, 28, 633, 2513, 1, 3, 4109, 1696, 225, 22, 135, 17, 10114, 4, 114, 7600, 68, 1054, 12, 193, 2, 15, 24, 51]",2044.0,30655087,Microbiome Genitourinary Collaborative Review,0,0.0
Genetic screens reveal mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation of tissue-specific genes in normal cells and tumors.,Nucleic acids research,Nucleic Acids Res.,2019-04-01,"The proper tissue-specific regulation of gene expression is essential for development and homeostasis in metazoans. However, the illegitimate expression of normally tissue-restricted genes-like testis- or placenta-specific genes-is frequently observed in tumors; this promotes transformation, but also allows immunotherapy. Two important questions are: how is the expression of these genes controlled in healthy cells? And how is this altered in cancer? To address these questions, we used an unbiased approach to test the ability of 350 distinct genetic or epigenetic perturbations to induce the illegitimate expression of over 40 tissue-restricted genes in primary human cells. We find that almost all of these genes are remarkably resistant to reactivation by a single alteration in signaling pathways or chromatin regulation. However, a few genes differ and are more readily activated; one is the placenta-expressed gene ADAM12, which promotes invasion. Using cellular systems, an animal model, and bioinformatics, we find that a non-canonical but druggable TGF-β/KAT2A/TAK1 axis controls ADAM12 induction in normal and cancer cells. More broadly, our data show that illegitimate gene expression in cancer is an heterogeneous phenomenon, with a few genes activatable by simple events, and most genes likely requiring a combination of events to become reactivated.",Journal Article,295.0,0.0,proper tissue-specific regulation expression essential development homeostasis metazoans illegitimate expression normally tissue-restricted genes-like testis- placenta-specific genes-is frequently observed promotes transformation allows immunotherapy important questions expression controlled healthy altered address questions unbiased approach test ability 350 distinct genetic epigenetic perturbations induce illegitimate expression 40 tissue-restricted primary human remarkably resistant reactivation single alteration signaling pathways chromatin regulation differ readily activated placenta-expressed ADAM12 promotes invasion cellular systems animal model bioinformatics non-canonical druggable TGF-β/KAT2A/TAK1 axis controls ADAM12 induction normal broadly illegitimate expression heterogeneous phenomenon activatable simple events likely requiring combination events reactivated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4576, 246, 112, 863, 1, 145, 55, 16, 1452, 9, 193, 2, 4975, 4, 74407, 137, 3, 24513, 55, 1, 6150, 246, 2016, 214, 733, 7697, 15, 19600, 112, 214, 16, 746, 164, 4, 57, 26, 2148, 1392, 84, 120, 2333, 726, 100, 305, 1937, 32, 832, 16, 3, 55, 1, 46, 214, 1149, 4, 1331, 37, 2, 832, 16, 26, 1495, 4, 12, 6, 1539, 46, 1937, 21, 95, 35, 7271, 353, 6, 412, 3, 801, 1, 5408, 834, 336, 15, 1418, 7013, 6, 1290, 3, 24513, 55, 1, 252, 327, 246, 2016, 214, 4, 86, 171, 37, 21, 2469, 17, 2214, 62, 1, 46, 214, 32, 4856, 436, 6, 3834, 20, 8, 226, 2611, 4, 314, 460, 15, 2287, 863, 137, 8, 1021, 214, 1505, 2, 32, 80, 3860, 735, 104, 16, 3, 19600, 570, 145, 34901, 92, 2148, 578, 75, 763, 1530, 35, 2026, 202, 2, 6579, 21, 2469, 17, 8, 220, 4471, 84, 9309, 2387, 1458, 74408, 14356, 2310, 535, 34901, 504, 4, 295, 2, 12, 37, 80, 5482, 114, 74, 514, 17, 24513, 145, 55, 4, 12, 16, 35, 1564, 3936, 5, 8, 1021, 214, 15627, 20, 2763, 281, 2, 96, 214, 322, 1888, 8, 150, 1, 281, 6, 1417, 13566]",1344.0,30753595,Genetic screens reveal mechanisms transcriptional regulation tissue-specific normal,0,0.0
Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Differentiate the Histology of Testicular Masses: A Systematic Review of Studies With Pathologic Confirmation.,Urology,Urology,2019-10-01,"Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate scrotal pathology.

We conducted a systematic review and found 9 studies related to MRI diagnosis of testicular masses. A total of 220 testicular masses (217 patients) undergoing MRI were identified. Notable findings include malignant masses having a lower apparent diffusion coefficient compared to benign masses (3 of 4 studies) and that quantitative enhancement patterns could differentiate Leydig cell tumors from germ cell tumors in 2 studies.
