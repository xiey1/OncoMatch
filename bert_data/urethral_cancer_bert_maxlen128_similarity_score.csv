Urinary continence after radical retropubic prostatectomy: relationship with membranous urethral length on preoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2002-09-01,"We determined whether membranous urethral length on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is predictive of urinary continence after radical retropubic prostatectomy. Membranous urethral length was measured on preoperative endorectal MRI in 211 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer before radical retropubic prostatectomy performed by a single surgeon. Neurovascular bundle resection was done in 60 cases. After surgery the time to stable postoperative continence was recorded in 180 cases and the level of stable continence was graded on a 5-point scale of 1-complete continence to 5-complete incontinence. After controlling for age and surgical technique multivariate analysis showed that membranous urethral length was related to time to stable postoperative continence (p = 0.02), such that a longer membranous urethra was associated with a shorter time to stable continence. For example, 1 year after surgery 120 of the 134 patients (89%) with a preoperative membranous urethral length of greater than 12 mm. were completely continent compared with 35 of the 46 (77%) with a preoperative length of 12 mm. or less. On endorectal MRI before radical prostatectomy a longer membranous urethra is associated with significantly more rapid return of urinary continence after surgery.",Journal Article,6351.0,164.0,determined membranous urethral length preoperative magnetic resonance imaging MRI predictive urinary continence radical retropubic prostatectomy Membranous urethral length measured preoperative endorectal MRI 211 consecutive patients newly diagnosed prostate radical retropubic prostatectomy performed single surgeon Neurovascular bundle resection 60 cases surgery time stable postoperative continence recorded 180 cases level stable continence graded 5-point scale 1-complete continence 5-complete incontinence controlling age surgical technique multivariate showed membranous urethral length related time stable postoperative continence p 0.02 longer membranous urethra associated shorter time stable continence example 1 year surgery 120 134 patients 89 preoperative membranous urethral length greater 12 mm completely continent compared 35 46 77 preoperative length 12 mm endorectal MRI radical prostatectomy longer membranous urethra associated significantly rapid return urinary continence surgery,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 509, 317, 6300, 1318, 23, 498, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 16, 464, 1, 1660, 7094, 50, 711, 8359, 1202, 6300, 1318, 10, 644, 23, 498, 5615, 704, 4, 5905, 935, 7, 5, 732, 265, 12, 348, 711, 8359, 1202, 173, 20, 8, 226, 1897, 9848, 11261, 170, 10, 1822, 4, 335, 140, 50, 152, 3, 98, 6, 585, 573, 7094, 10, 1872, 4, 3172, 140, 2, 3, 301, 1, 585, 7094, 10, 3468, 23, 8, 33, 741, 1124, 1, 14, 236, 7094, 6, 33, 236, 6152, 50, 1893, 9, 89, 2, 221, 1312, 331, 65, 224, 17, 6300, 1318, 10, 139, 6, 98, 6, 585, 573, 7094, 19, 13, 588, 225, 17, 8, 589, 6300, 9358, 10, 41, 5, 8, 985, 98, 6, 585, 7094, 9, 2685, 14, 111, 50, 152, 2031, 1, 3, 4842, 7, 887, 5, 8, 498, 6300, 1318, 1, 378, 76, 133, 321, 11, 2500, 10396, 72, 5, 465, 1, 3, 641, 849, 5, 8, 498, 1318, 1, 133, 321, 15, 299, 23, 5615, 704, 348, 711, 1202, 8, 589, 6300, 9358, 16, 41, 5, 97, 80, 1321, 4656, 1, 1660, 7094, 50, 152]",1241.0,12187216,Urinary continence radical retropubic prostatectomy relationship membranous urethral length preoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging,0,0.0
Orthotopic urinary diversion after cystectomy for bladder cancer: implications for cancer control and patterns of disease recurrence.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-01-01,"The impact of orthotopic urinary diversion on the quality of cystectomy and ensuing cancer control has not been adequately studied. We analyzed our experience with this clinical problem. The records of 214 patients who underwent cystectomy and orthotopic diversion for bladder cancer were retrospectively evaluated and compared with those of 269 treated with an ileal conduit. Analyzed end points included overall and cancer specific survival. We specifically assessed the patterns of relapse and their association with pathological findings at cystectomy in the neobladder group. No cancer specific survival difference was identified in the neobladder and ileal conduit cohorts when adjusting for pathological stage. Patterns of relapse in 62 of the 214 patients with a neobladder (29%) included local recurrence in 23 (11%), distant recurrence in 19 (9%), and combined local and distant recurrence in 18 (8%). Urethral recurrence was rare (2%). Of 10 patients (4.6%) diagnosed with upper tract recurrence 6 and 4 initially had relapse in the ureteroenteric anastomosis and renal pelvis, respectively. Five of the 6 patients with anastomotic relapse had evidence of disease in the intramural or juxtavesical ureter that was removed en bloc with the cystectomy specimen. Only 1 patient required neobladder takedown after such anastomotic recurrence. These results indicate that neobladders do not compromise the quality of preceding cystectomy or interfere with management in the presence of local or distant disease relapse. Our data suggest that involvement of the intramural or juxtavesical ureteral segment at cystectomy irrespective of surgical margin status may identify patients at higher risk for anastomotic recurrence, which is associated with an ominous prognosis.",Comparative Study,6229.0,90.0,impact orthotopic urinary diversion quality cystectomy ensuing control adequately studied experience clinical problem records 214 patients underwent cystectomy orthotopic diversion bladder retrospectively evaluated compared 269 treated ileal conduit end points included overall specific survival specifically assessed patterns relapse association pathological findings cystectomy neobladder group specific survival difference identified neobladder ileal conduit cohorts adjusting pathological stage Patterns relapse 62 214 patients neobladder 29 included local recurrence 23 11 distant recurrence 19 9 combined local distant recurrence 18 8 Urethral recurrence rare 2 10 patients 4.6 diagnosed upper tract recurrence 6 4 initially relapse ureteroenteric anastomosis renal pelvis respectively 6 patients anastomotic relapse evidence disease intramural juxtavesical ureter removed en bloc cystectomy specimen 1 patient required neobladder takedown anastomotic recurrence indicate neobladders compromise quality preceding cystectomy interfere management presence local distant disease relapse suggest involvement intramural juxtavesical ureteral segment cystectomy irrespective surgical margin status identify patients higher risk anastomotic recurrence associated ominous prognosis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 345, 1, 2157, 1660, 6067, 23, 3, 372, 1, 1750, 2, 11937, 12, 182, 71, 44, 85, 4215, 656, 21, 311, 114, 730, 5, 26, 38, 2497, 3, 1064, 1, 6900, 7, 54, 208, 1750, 2, 2157, 6067, 9, 12, 11, 894, 194, 2, 72, 5, 135, 1, 8639, 73, 5, 35, 9185, 10439, 311, 396, 862, 159, 63, 2, 12, 112, 25, 21, 1225, 275, 3, 764, 1, 429, 2, 136, 248, 5, 1301, 272, 28, 1750, 4, 3, 17698, 87, 77, 12, 112, 25, 523, 10, 108, 4, 3, 17698, 2, 9185, 10439, 736, 198, 1358, 9, 1301, 82, 764, 1, 429, 4, 744, 1, 3, 6900, 7, 5, 8, 17698, 462, 159, 293, 146, 4, 382, 175, 626, 146, 4, 326, 83, 2, 397, 293, 2, 626, 146, 4, 203, 66, 146, 10, 622, 18, 1, 79, 7, 39, 49, 265, 5, 1726, 1696, 146, 49, 2, 39, 1625, 42, 429, 4, 3, 53290, 5519, 2, 3270, 106, 365, 1, 3, 49, 7, 5, 4818, 429, 42, 241, 1, 34, 4, 3, 22056, 15, 43116, 9775, 17, 10, 2264, 4375, 5590, 5, 3, 1750, 2360, 158, 14, 69, 616, 17698, 42905, 50, 225, 4818, 146, 46, 99, 1008, 17, 53291, 1022, 44, 4665, 3, 372, 1, 5892, 1750, 15, 6178, 5, 284, 4, 3, 463, 1, 293, 15, 626, 34, 429, 114, 74, 309, 17, 799, 1, 3, 22056, 15, 43116, 7213, 4610, 28, 1750, 3500, 1, 221, 959, 156, 68, 255, 7, 28, 142, 43, 9, 4818, 146, 92, 16, 41, 5, 35, 17173, 356]",1717.0,12478130,Orthotopic urinary diversion cystectomy bladder implications control patterns disease recurrence,0,0.0
Value of urethral wash cytology in the retained male urethra after radical cystoprostatectomy.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2003-03-01,"We determined the outcome in patients who underwent urethrectomy after cystectomy followed by routine urethral wash cytology versus those not followed by urethral wash cytology who presented with bleeding or urethral discharge. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome in post-cystectomy urethrectomy cases at our institution from 1994 to 2000. A total of 24 patients with a median age of 70.5 years underwent urethrectomy after cystectomy, including 17 due to asymptomatic, positive urethral wash cytology (group 1) and 7 who were not followed by urethral wash and presented with bleeding/urethral discharge (group 2). Median time from cystectomy to urethrectomy was 11.4 months (range 6.7 to 67.1). Median followup after cystectomy and urethrectomy was 37 and 27.7 months, respectively. Urethrectomy pathological evaluation showed pTis disease in cases 12 (50%), pT0 in 9 (37.5%) and pT1 in 3 (12.5%). Cystectomy pathology was organ confined (pT0, pTis and pT1-pT2b disease) in 12 cases (50%), nonorgan confined (pT3a-pT4) in 6 (25%) and pT any N1 in 5 (21%). Cystectomy pathology was unknown in 1 case. At the most recent followup there was no evidence of disease in 14 patients (58%), 5 (21%) were alive with disease, 3 (12.5%) were dead of disease, 1 (4%) was dead of other causes and disease status was unknown in 1 (4%). There was no statistical difference in survival in groups 1 and 2 when controlling for original bladder tumor stage. Cox regression analysis revealed that cystectomy pathology was the only statistically significant parameter of disease-free survival (p = 0.011), while urethrectomy pathology and followup method (urethral washing versus no washing) were not significant. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications and no patients died. There was no significant survival difference in patients followed and not followed with urethral washing.

Immediate versus staged urethrectomy in patients at high risk of urethral recurrence: is there a benefit to either approach?,Urology,Urology,2006-03-01,"To compare treatment-related outcomes of immediate and staged urethrectomy in patients at high risk of urethral recurrence. We retrospectively identified 76 male patients with cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who had undergone urethrectomy in the absence of established urethral recurrence. Concomitant cystoprostatectomy and urethrectomy was performed in 57 patients and staged urethrectomy in 19 patients. The criteria for staged urethrectomy were the presence of a positive urethral margin or established transitional cell carcinoma of the urethra in the cystectomy specimen. The mean interval from cystectomy to staged urethrectomy was 4.7 months (range 1.4 to 14). The most common pathologic finding of the urethrectomy specimens was prostatic duct involvement (31.6%) in the immediate urethrectomy group and Stage pT0 in the delayed urethrectomy group (73.7%). No statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival was noted between the immediate and staged groups (P = 0.14). Similarly, no difference was noted in postoperative complication rates or total operative blood loss (P = 0.77 and P = 0.64, respectively). However, a slight benefit for immediate urethrectomy was noted in the total duration of hospitalization (P = 0.01). The presence of local or distant recurrence was a predictor of disease-specific survival (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). Immediate and staged urethrectomy appear to be similar in surgical morbidity and disease-specific survival. A benefit was noted for the immediate group in the total duration of hospitalization.

"Urinary diversion: options, patient selection, and outcomes.",Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2007-04-01,"Improved survival following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer as a result of advancements in combination chemotherapy and surgical technique has resulted in a philosophical change in the surgeon's approach to urinary diversion selection. Aims have evolved from the mere diversion of urine to a functional bowel conduit such as an ileal conduit or ureterosigmoidostomy, to providing the optimal diversion for the patient's quality of life. While quality of life is important, one must also consider the stage of cancer and individual patient comorbidities. Which diversion provides the best local cancer control, the lowest potential for complications (short and long term), and the easiest emotional adjustment in lifestyle while still allowing the timely completion of chemotherapy and therapeutic goals? A multidisciplinary approach to diversion selection that includes the patient, the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, internist, and surgeon is ideal. We describe the three most commonly used types of diversions today, including conduits, continent cutaneous reservoirs, and orthotopic urethral diversions, as well as issues relative to patient selection and functional outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for the treatment of bladder cancer.",Journal Article,4678.0,27.0,Improved survival following radical cystectomy bladder advancements combination chemotherapy surgical technique resulted philosophical change surgeon 's approach urinary diversion selection Aims evolved mere diversion urine functional bowel conduit ileal conduit ureterosigmoidostomy providing optimal diversion patient 's quality life quality life important consider stage individual patient comorbidities diversion provides best local control lowest potential complications short long term easiest emotional adjustment lifestyle allowing timely completion chemotherapy therapeutic goals multidisciplinary approach diversion selection includes patient medical oncologist radiation oncologist internist surgeon ideal commonly types diversions today including conduits continent cutaneous reservoirs orthotopic urethral diversions issues relative patient selection functional outcomes patients undergoing radical cystectomy treatment bladder,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[231, 25, 366, 711, 1750, 9, 12, 22, 8, 757, 1, 6217, 4, 150, 56, 2, 221, 1312, 71, 627, 4, 8, 34236, 707, 4, 3, 1897, 292, 353, 6, 1660, 6067, 881, 2970, 47, 3937, 29, 3, 28660, 6067, 1, 2646, 6, 8, 583, 1659, 10439, 225, 22, 35, 9185, 10439, 15, 56147, 6, 1736, 3, 665, 6067, 9, 3, 69, 292, 372, 1, 358, 369, 372, 1, 358, 16, 305, 104, 1642, 120, 2419, 3, 82, 1, 12, 2, 797, 69, 1909, 92, 6067, 777, 3, 824, 293, 12, 182, 3, 2101, 174, 9, 521, 978, 2, 319, 337, 2, 3, 34237, 2671, 1852, 4, 3487, 369, 1234, 2952, 3, 4225, 1438, 1, 56, 2, 189, 2802, 8, 1643, 353, 6, 6067, 881, 17, 1920, 3, 69, 3, 484, 2709, 121, 2709, 38401, 2, 1897, 16, 3662, 21, 897, 3, 169, 96, 841, 95, 630, 1, 21206, 5665, 141, 34238, 10396, 1486, 17087, 2, 2157, 21206, 22, 149, 22, 1553, 580, 6, 69, 881, 2, 583, 123, 4, 7, 479, 711, 1750, 9, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1231.0,17382793,Urinary diversion options patient selection outcomes,0,0.0
Prostatic urethral biopsy has limited usefulness in counseling patients regarding final urethral margin status during orthotopic neobladder reconstruction.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2008-05-15,"We determined the value of preoperative transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy in predicting final distal urethral margin status at radical cystectomy. Of 1,006 patients undergoing radical cystectomy at our institution between 1990 and 2004, 252 were men who underwent ileal neobladder and form the basis of this report. Variables collected include pathology of prostatic urethral biopsies, final pathology of the prostate, frozen section of the distal urethra, final urethral margins and survival data. Median patient age was 61 years. Data regarding preoperative transurethral resection prostatic urethral biopsy and/or frozen section of the urethra at the time of surgery were available for 245 of 252 patients (transurethral resection of the prostatic urethra alone in 127, urethral frozen section alone in 68 and both in 50). The incidence of positive distal urethral margin on final pathological examination was 1.1% (3 of 252) and urethral recurrence was 0.7% (2 of 252). The correlation between transurethral resection findings and frozen section margins was only 68%, and 16 patients with positive transurethral resection findings had negative frozen section margins. The negative predictive value of transurethral resection biopsy with respect to final margins was 99.4% and that of frozen section was 100%. While patients with no tumor on transurethral resection biopsy of the prostatic urethra have a high likelihood of negative urethral margins on final pathological evaluation, optimal negative predictive value is obtained with frozen sections. Furthermore, a positive transurethral resection prostatic urethral biopsy does not correlate with final margin and should not exclude patients from consideration for orthotopic diversion.",Journal Article,4268.0,37.0,"determined value preoperative transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy predicting final distal urethral margin status radical cystectomy 1,006 patients undergoing radical cystectomy institution 1990 2004 252 men underwent ileal neobladder form basis report Variables collected include pathology prostatic urethral biopsies final pathology prostate frozen section distal urethra final urethral margins survival Median patient age 61 years preoperative transurethral resection prostatic urethral biopsy and/or frozen section urethra time surgery available 245 252 patients transurethral resection prostatic urethra 127 urethral frozen section 68 50 incidence positive distal urethral margin final pathological examination 1.1 3 252 urethral recurrence 0.7 2 252 correlation transurethral resection findings frozen section margins 68 16 patients positive transurethral resection findings negative frozen section margins negative predictive value transurethral resection biopsy respect final margins 99.4 frozen section 100 patients transurethral resection biopsy prostatic urethra high likelihood negative urethral margins final pathological evaluation optimal negative predictive value obtained frozen sections Furthermore positive transurethral resection prostatic urethral biopsy correlate final margin exclude patients consideration orthotopic diversion",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 509, 3, 549, 1, 498, 5079, 3329, 411, 4, 1434, 1457, 2107, 959, 156, 28, 711, 1750, 1, 14, 1861, 7, 479, 711, 1750, 28, 114, 731, 59, 2289, 2, 1131, 6951, 11, 325, 54, 208, 9185, 17698, 2, 1297, 3, 877, 1, 26, 414, 682, 786, 643, 1117, 1, 3329, 1154, 1457, 1117, 1, 3, 3015, 2917, 1, 3, 2107, 9358, 1457, 1012, 2, 25, 74, 52, 69, 89, 10, 713, 60, 74, 666, 498, 5079, 170, 3329, 411, 2, 15, 3015, 2917, 1, 3, 9358, 28, 3, 98, 1, 152, 11, 390, 9, 7373, 1, 6951, 7, 5079, 170, 1, 3, 3329, 9358, 279, 4, 4080, 3015, 2917, 279, 4, 806, 2, 110, 4, 212, 3, 287, 1, 109, 2107, 959, 23, 1457, 1301, 1385, 10, 14, 14, 27, 1, 6951, 2, 146, 10, 13, 67, 18, 1, 6951, 3, 816, 59, 5079, 170, 272, 2, 3015, 2917, 1012, 10, 158, 806, 2, 245, 7, 5, 109, 5079, 170, 272, 42, 199, 3015, 2917, 1012, 3, 199, 464, 549, 1, 5079, 170, 411, 5, 2184, 6, 1457, 1012, 10, 1058, 39, 2, 17, 1, 3015, 2917, 10, 394, 369, 7, 5, 77, 30, 23, 5079, 170, 411, 1, 3, 3329, 9358, 47, 8, 64, 1420, 1, 199, 1012, 23, 1457, 1301, 451, 665, 199, 464, 549, 16, 683, 5, 3015, 3013, 798, 8, 109, 5079, 170, 3329, 411, 1097, 44, 1513, 5, 1457, 959, 2, 257, 44, 6262, 7, 29, 2415, 9, 2157, 6067]",1620.0,18485384,Prostatic urethral biopsy limited usefulness counseling patients final urethral margin status orthotopic neobladder reconstruction,0,0.0
Recovery of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy: association with urethral length and urethral fibrosis measured by preoperative and postoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2008-09-02,"Limited data on endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and urinary continence after radical prostatectomy (RP) are available. To assess whether recovery of urinary continence after RP is associated with endorectal MRI findings regarding preoperative and postoperative membranous urethral length (MUL), percent change in MUL, and postoperative urethral and periurethral fibrosis. Sixty-four patients who received an MRI scan before and after RP for localized prostate cancer were evaluated in a retrospective study at a single institution. All patients underwent RP. The postoperative scan was performed to detect local recurrence in patients with rising levels of prostate-specific antigen. Urinary continence was graded on a five-point scale. MUL was measured on T2-weighted images. Urethral and periurethral fibrosis was graded from 0 to III based on axial T2-weighted images. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess variables associated with continence. Forty-eight patients regained continence following surgery. The median follow-up for patient who were incontinent at their last assessment was 7 mo. The median interval from RP to postoperative endorectal MRI was 10 mo. A longer preoperative or postoperative MUL was associated with superior continence (both p<0.01). The MUL loss ratio was significantly associated with postoperative continence (p=0.02). Patients with a high grade of postoperative periurethral fibrosis tended to have worse postoperative continence; nevertheless a statistical correlation was not reached (hazard ratio: 0.64, p=0.16). This is a retrospective study. Preoperative and postoperative MUL and the MUL loss ratio are related to the recovery time and level of urinary continence after RP. Therefore, preservation of urethral length during surgery is recommended.

Comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer surgical treatments: a population based analysis of postoperative outcomes.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2010-02-25,"Enthusiasm for laparoscopic surgical approaches to prostate cancer treatment has grown despite limited evidence of improved outcomes compared with open radical prostatectomy. We compared laparoscopic prostatectomy with or without robotic assistance vs open radical prostatectomy in terms of postoperative outcomes and subsequent cancer directed therapy. Using a population based cancer registry linked with Medicare claims we identified men 66 years old or older with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2003 to 2005. Outcome measures were general medical/surgical complications and mortality within 90 days after surgery, genitourinary/bowel complications within 365 days, radiation therapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy within 365 days and length of hospital stay. Of the 5,923 men 18% underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics, there were no differences in the rate of general medical/surgical complications (OR 0.93 95% CI 0.77-1.14) or genitourinary/bowel complications (OR 0.96 95% CI 0.76-1.22), or in postoperative radiation and/or androgen deprivation (OR 0.80 95% CI 0.60-1.08).

An improved prognostic model for stage T1a and T1b prostate cancer by assessments of cancer extent.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-09-10,"Treatment decisions on prostate cancer diagnosed by trans-urethral resection (TURP) of the prostate are difficult. The current TNM staging system for pT1 prostate cancer has not been re-evaluated for 25 years. Our objective was to optimise the predictive power of tumor extent measurements in TURP of the prostate specimens. A total of 914 patients diagnosed by TURP of the prostate between 1990 and 1996, managed conservatively were identified. The clinical end point was death from prostate cancer. Diagnostic serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and contemporary Gleason grading was available. Cancer extent was measured by the percentage of chips infiltrated by cancer. Death rates were compared by univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models, including baseline PSA and Gleason score. The percentage of positive chips was highly predictive of prostate cancer death when assessed as a continuous variable or as a grouped variable on the basis of and including the quintiles, quartiles, tertiles and median groups. In the univariate model, the most informative variable was a four group-split (≤10%, >10-25%, >25-75% and >75%); (HR=2.08, 95% CI=1.8-2.4, P<0.0001). The same was true in a multivariate model (ΔX(2) (1 d.f.)=15.0, P=0.0001). The current cutoff used by TNM (<=5%) was sub-optimal (ΔX(2) (1 d.f.)=4.8, P=0.023). The current TNM staging results in substantial loss of information.

Recovery of urinary function after radical prostatectomy: predictors of urinary function on preoperative prostate magnetic resonance imaging.,The Journal of urology,J. Urol.,2012-01-20,"We determined whether pelvic soft tissue and bony dimensions on endorectal magnetic resonance imaging influence the recovery of continence after radical prostatectomy, and whether adding significant magnetic resonance imaging variables to a statistical model improves the prediction of continence recovery. Between 2001 and 2004, 967 men undergoing radical prostatectomy underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Soft tissue and bony dimensions were retrospectively measured by 2 raters blinded to clinical and pathological data. Patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, who were preoperatively incontinent or had missing followup for continence were excluded from study, leaving 600 patients eligible for analysis. No pad use defined continent. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with continence recovery at 6 and 12 months. We evaluated whether the predictive accuracy of a base model was improved by adding independently significant magnetic resonance imaging variables. Urethral length and urethral volume were significantly associated with the recovery of continence at 6 and 12 months. Larger inner and outer levator distances were significantly associated with a decreased probability of regaining continence at 6 or 12 months, but they did not reach statistical significance for other points. Addition of these 4 magnetic resonance imaging variables to a base model including age, clinical stage, prostate specific antigen and comorbidities marginally improved the discrimination (12-month AUC improved from 0.587 to 0.634). Membranous urethral length, urethral volume, and an anatomically close relation between the levator muscle and membranous urethra on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging are independent predictors of continence recovery after radical prostatectomy.

Feasibility study of a clinically-integrated randomized trial of modifications to radical prostatectomy.,Trials,Trials,2012-02-24,"Numerous technical modifications to radical prostatectomy have been proposed. Such modifications are likely to lead to only slight improvements in outcomes. Although small differences would be worthwhile, an appropriately powered randomized trial would need to be very large, and thus of doubtful feasibility given the expense, complexity and regulatory burden of contemporary clinical trials. We have proposed a novel methodology, the clinically-integrated randomized trial, which dramatically streamlines trial procedures in order to reduce the marginal cost of an additional patient towards zero. We aimed to determine the feasibility of implementing such a trial for radical prostatectomy. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as initial treatment for prostate cancer were randomized in a factorial design to involvement of the fascia during placement of the anastomotic sutures, urethral irrigation, both or neither. Endpoint data were obtained from routine clinical documentation. Accrual and compliance rates were monitored to determine the feasibility of the trial. From a total of 260 eligible patients, 154 (59%) consented; 56 patients declined to participate, 20 were not approached on recommendation of the treating surgeon, and 30 were not approached for logistical reasons. Although recording by surgeons of the procedure used was incomplete (~80%), compliance with randomization was excellent when it was recorded, with only 6% of procedures inconsistent with allocation. Outcomes data was received from 71% of patients at one year. This improved to 83% as the trial progressed. A clinically-integrated randomized trial was conducted at low cost, with excellent accrual, and acceptable compliance with treatment allocation and outcomes reporting. This demonstrates the feasibility of the methodology. Improved methods to ensure documentation of surgical procedures would be required before wider implementation.

"The antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, prevents side-effects incurred by prostate cancer irradiation.",PloS one,PLoS ONE,2012-09-12,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually in the United States. Due to early detection and advances in therapies, more than 90% of patients will survive 10 years post diagnosis and treatment. Radiation is a treatment option often used to treat localized disease; however, while radiation is very effective at killing tumor cells, normal tissues are damaged as well. Potential side-effects due to prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, rectal bleeding and incontinence. Currently, radiation therapy for prostate cancer does not include the administration of therapeutic agents to reduce these side effects and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced damage. In the current study, we show that the small molecular weight antioxidant, MnTE-2-PyP, protects normal tissues from radiation-induced damage in the lower abdomen in rats. Specifically, MnTE-2-PyP protected skin, prostate, and testes from radiation-induced damage. MnTE-2-PyP also protected from erectile dysfunction, a persistent problem regardless of the type of radiation techniques used because the penile neurovascular bundles lay in the peripheral zones of the prostate, where most prostate cancers reside. Based on previous studies showing that MnTE-2-PyP, in combination with radiation, further reduces subcutaneous tumor growth, we believe that MnTE-2-PyP represents an excellent radioprotectant in combination radiotherapy for cancer in general and specifically for prostate cancer.",Journal Article,2687.0,24.0,"Prostate commonly diagnosed estimated 240,000 new cases reported annually United States early detection advances therapies 90 patients survive 10 years post diagnosis treatment Radiation treatment option treat localized disease radiation effective killing normal tissues damaged Potential side-effects prostate cancer-related radiation therapy include bowel inflammation erectile dysfunction urethral stricture rectal bleeding incontinence Currently radiation therapy prostate include administration therapeutic agents reduce effects protect normal tissues radiation-induced damage current small molecular weight antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP protects normal tissues radiation-induced damage lower abdomen rats Specifically MnTE-2-PyP protected skin prostate testes radiation-induced damage MnTE-2-PyP protected erectile dysfunction persistent problem regardless type radiation techniques penile neurovascular bundles lay peripheral zones prostate prostate reside Based previous studies showing MnTE-2-PyP combination radiation reduces subcutaneous growth believe MnTE-2-PyP represents excellent radioprotectant combination radiotherapy general specifically prostate",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[12, 16, 3, 96, 841, 265, 12, 5, 35, 661, 4263, 984, 217, 140, 210, 4226, 4, 3, 1088, 907, 520, 6, 191, 638, 2, 954, 4, 235, 80, 76, 424, 1, 7, 303, 4573, 79, 60, 539, 147, 2, 24, 121, 16, 8, 24, 1501, 629, 95, 6, 943, 909, 34, 137, 369, 121, 16, 923, 323, 28, 3003, 30, 37, 295, 742, 32, 9884, 22, 149, 174, 1152, 176, 520, 6, 12, 139, 121, 36, 643, 1659, 1815, 5186, 1527, 6673, 2294, 2, 6152, 694, 121, 36, 9, 12, 1097, 44, 643, 3, 634, 1, 189, 183, 6, 969, 46, 1152, 176, 2, 4869, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 291, 45, 21, 514, 17, 3, 302, 219, 924, 5536, 32022, 18, 32023, 8170, 295, 742, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 4, 3, 280, 4036, 4, 3765, 1225, 32022, 18, 32023, 5541, 2, 13100, 29, 121, 277, 1350, 32022, 18, 32023, 120, 5541, 29, 5186, 1527, 8, 1882, 2497, 1583, 1, 3, 267, 1, 121, 1092, 95, 408, 3, 9848, 16206, 9455, 4, 3, 672, 13814, 1, 3, 1257, 96, 163, 10114, 90, 23, 698, 94, 2069, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 4, 150, 5, 121, 195, 2389, 2529, 30, 129, 21, 4629, 17, 32022, 18, 32023, 1449, 35, 1503, 47400, 4, 150, 310, 9, 12, 4, 1083, 2, 1225, 9, 12]",1473.0,22984473,antioxidant MnTE-2-PyP prevents side-effects incurred prostate irradiation,12,0.34285714285714286
Dosimetric quality and evolution of edema after low-dose-rate brachytherapy for small prostates: implications for the use of newer isotopes.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2013-08-02,"To characterize prostate swelling and dosimetry in patients with small prostate volumes (PVs) undergoing brachytherapy. We studied 25 patients with PV <25 cc (range, 15.1-24.8) and 65 patients with PV ≥25 cc (range, 25.0-66.2) based on three-dimensional ultrasound contours who underwent brachytherapy monotherapy with intraoperative planning. Postoperative Days 1 and 30 dosimetry was done by CT-MRI fusion. Small PVs had greater Day 1 swelling than large PVs (32.5% increase in volume vs. 23.7%, p = 0.04), but by Day 30, swelling was minimal and not significantly different (p = 0.44). Small PVs had greater seed and needle densities at implant (p < 0.001). Rectal and urethral doses were nearly identical by Day 30 (small PV rectum receiving 100% of the prescription dose [145 Gy] [V100] = 0.32 cc; large PV rectum V100 = 0.33 cc, p = 0.99; small PV urethra receiving 150% of the prescription dose [145 Gy] [V150] = 0.20, large PV urethra V150 = 0.20, p = 0.91). Swelling at Day 1 created some cool implants (rate dose that covers 90% of the prostate volume [D90 <140 Gy = 12.0% and 9.4% for the small and large PV groups, respectively, p = 0.71), but Day 30 planning target volume coverage was excellent (rate D90 <140 Gy = 0% for both groups). Although smaller prostates have greater Day 1 swelling, good Day 30 dosimetry can be achieved, making them excellent candidates for (125)I seeds (half-life [t½] = 60 days).

Simultaneous activation of Kras and inactivation of p53 induces soft tissue sarcoma and bladder urothelial hyperplasia.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-09-18,"The development of the Cre recombinase-controlled (Cre/LoxP) technique allows the manipulation of specific tumorigenic genes, temporarily and spatially. Our original intention of this study was to investigate the role of Kras and p53 in the development of urinary bladder cancer. First, to validate the effect of intravesical delivery on Cre recombination (Adeno-Cre), we examined activity and expression of β-galactosidase in the bladder of control ROSA transgenic mice. The results confirmed specific recombination as evidenced by β-galactosidase activity in the bladder urothelium of these mice. Then, we administered the same adenovirus into the bladder of double transgenic Kras(LSLG12D/+). p53(fl/fl) mice. The virus solution was held in place by a distal urethral retention suture for 2 hours. To our surprise, there was a rapid development of a spindle-cell tumor with sarcoma characteristics near the suture site, within the pelvic area but outside the urinary track. Since we did not see any detectable β-galactosidase in the area outside of the bladder in the validating (control) experiment, we interpreted that this sarcoma formation was likely due to transduction by Adeno-Cre in the soft tissue of the suture site. To avoid the loss of skin integrity associated with the retention suture, we transitioned to an alternative technique without suture to retain the Adeno-Cre into the bladder cavity. Interestingly, although multiple Adeno-Cre treatments were applied, only urothelial hyperplasia but not carcinogenesis was observed in the subsequent experiments of up to 6 months. In conclusion, we observed that the simultaneous inactivation of p53 and activation of Kras induces quick formation of spindle-cell sarcoma in the soft tissues adjacent to the bladder but slow formation of urothelial hyperplasia inside the bladder. These results strongly suggest that the effect of oncogene regulation to produce either hyperplasia or carcinogenesis greatly depends on the tissue type.

Optimal timing of early versus delayed adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer.,Urologic oncology,Urol. Oncol.,2013-12-08,"Although post-radical prostatectomy (RP) adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) benefits disease that is staged as pT3 or higher, the optimal ART timing remains unknown. Our objective is to characterize the outcomes and optimal timing of early vs. delayed ART. From the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data from 1995 to 2007, we identified 963 men with pT3N0 disease receiving early (<4 mo after RP, n = 419) vs. delayed (4-12 mo after RP, n = 544) ART after RP. Utilizing propensity score methods, we compared overall mortality, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), bone-related events (BRE), salvage hormonal therapy utilization, and intervention for urethral stricture. We then used the maximal statistic approach to determine at what time post-RP ART had the most significant effect on outcomes of interest in men with pT3N0 disease. When compared with delayed ART in men with pT3 disease, early ART was associated with improved PCSM (0.47 vs. 1.02 events per 100 person-years; P = 0.038) and less salvage hormonal therapy (2.88 vs. 4.59 events per 100 person-years; P = 0.001). Delaying ART beyond 5 months is associated with worse PCSM (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3; P = 0.020), beyond 3 months is associated with more BRE (HR 1.6; P = 0.025), and beyond 4 months is associated higher rates of salvage hormonal therapy (HR 1.6; P = 0.002). ART performed after 9 months was associated with fewer urethral strictures (HR 0.6; P = 0.042). Initiating ART less than 5 months after RP for pT3 is associated with improved PCSM.

Management of advanced primary urethral carcinomas.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2014-05-22,"Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) is a rare malignancy accounting for <1% of genitourinary cancers, with a predilection for men and African-Americans. The sites and histology of urethral carcinoma vary by gender and anatomical location. Squamous cell carcinoma is most common among both genders but adenocarcinomas are noted in 15-35% of cases among women. Obstructive or irritative symptoms and haematuria are common modes of presentation. Clinical evaluation includes cystourethroscopy with biopsy and examination under anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a highly effective method to image the primary tumour while defıning the potential involvement of surrounding structures. Most tumours are localised, with regional metastases to nodal sites seen in up to 30% of cases in both genders, while distant metastases at presentation are rare (0-6%), but occur in up to 40% of cases with recurrent disease. Among men, the two most important prognostic factors are disease location and stage. Low-stage tumours (T1-2) and tumours involving the fossa navicularis or the penile urethra have a better prognosis than higher stage tumours (>T2 or N+) and lesions involving the bulbomembranous urethra. In women, in addition to stage and location, the size of the tumour has also prognostic implications. While surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are of benefit in early stage disease, advanced stage PUC requires multimodal treatment strategies to optimise local control and survival. These include induction chemotherapy followed by surgery or RT and concurrent chemoradiation with or without surgery. The latter strategy has been used successfully to treat other human papillomavirus-related cancers of the vagina, cervix and anus and may be of value in achieving organ preservation. Given the rarity of PUC, prospective multi-institutional studies are needed to better define the optimal treatment approach for this disease entity.

Placement of empty catheters for an HDR-emulating LDR prostate brachytherapy technique: comparison to standard intraoperative planning.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2014-03-05,"We sought to determine whether placing empty catheters within the prostate and then inverse planning iodine-125 seed locations within those catheters (High Dose Rate-Emulating Low Dose Rate Prostate Brachytherapy [HELP] technique) would improve concordance between planned and achieved dosimetry compared with a standard intraoperative technique. We examined 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by standard intraoperative technique of planning followed by needle placement/seed deposition and compared them to 30 consecutive low dose rate prostate cases performed by the HELP technique. The primary endpoint was concordance between planned percentage of the clinical target volume that receives at least 100% of the prescribed dose/dose that covers 90% of the volume of the clinical target volume (V100/D90) and the actual V100/D90 achieved at Postoperative Day 1. The HELP technique had superior concordance between the planned target dosimetry and what was actually achieved at Day 1 and Day 30. Specifically, target D90 at Day 1 was on average 33.7 Gy less than planned for the standard intraoperative technique but was only 10.5 Gy less than planned for the HELP technique (p < 0.001). Day 30 values were 16.6 Gy less vs. 2.2 Gy more than planned, respectively (p = 0.028). Day 1 target V100 was 6.3% less than planned with standard vs. 2.8% less for HELP (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the urethral and rectal concordance (all p > 0.05).

Extra-prostatic transgene-associated neoplastic lesions in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice.,Toxicologic pathology,Toxicol Pathol,2014-04-17,"Male transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice are frequently used in prostate cancer research because their prostates consistently develop a series of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. Disease progression in TRAMP mouse prostates culminates in metastatic, poorly differentiated carcinomas with neuroendocrine features. The androgen dependence of the rat probasin promoter largely limits transgene expression to the prostatic epithelium. However, extra-prostatic transgene-positive lesions have been described in TRAMP mice, including renal tubuloacinar carcinomas, neuroendocrine carcinomas of the urethra, and phyllodes-like tumors of the seminal vesicle. Here, we describe the histologic and immunohistochemical features of 2 novel extra-prostatic lesions in TRAMP mice: primary anaplastic tumors of uncertain cell origin in the midbrain and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of the submandibular salivary gland. These newly characterized tumors apparently result from transgene expression in extra-prostatic locations rather than representing metastatic prostate neoplasms because lesions were identified in both male and female mice and in male TRAMP mice without histologically apparent prostate tumors. In this article, we also calculate the incidences of the urethral carcinomas and renal tubuloacinar carcinomas, further elucidate the biological behavior of the urethral carcinomas, and demonstrate the critical importance of complete necropsies even when evaluating presumably well characterized phenotypes in genetically engineered mice.

Ureteral and urethral frozen sections during radical cystectomy or cystoprostatectomy: an analysis of denudation and atypia.,Urology,Urology,2014-09-01,"To evaluate denudation (no urothelium present for evaluation) and atypia (urothelial carcinoma in situ [CIS] cannot be ruled out) on frozen sections (FSs) of ureteral and urethral margins in radical cystectomies and cystoprostatectomies. In radical cystectomies from 2000-2012, we compared FS diagnoses with the corresponding permanent section of the same tissue (frozen section control [FSC]). We also compared FS to ""any CIS,"" which assessed whether there was any CIS in a given ureter or urethra, combining the diagnoses on ""frozen section control"" and on all submitted ureteral and urethral sections in a case. We analyzed 1222 ureteral and 366 urethral FSs in 822 surgical cases. On FS for ureters, there were 56 diagnoses of atypia, 19 (33.9%) of which showed CIS on FSC, and 81 diagnoses of denudation, 1 (1.2%) of which showed CIS on FSC. On FS for urethras, there were 12 diagnoses of atypia, 2 (16.7%) of which showed CIS on FSC, and 17 diagnoses of denudation, 1 (5.9%) of which showed CIS on FSC. Twenty-three patients (38.3%) with atypia and 14 patients (15.0%) with denudation on FS had a finding of ""any CIS."" A diagnosis of either atypia or denudation on FS was predictive of finding CIS on FSC and ""any CIS"" in a given ureter or urethra (P <.0001). Half of margins positive for CIS on the first FS were converted to a final negative margin by resecting additional tissue.

Image-based multichannel vaginal cylinder brachytherapy for vaginal cancer.,Brachytherapy,Brachytherapy,2014-11-12,"To investigate the clinical feasibility and treatment outcomes of image-based high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy using an intracavitary multichannel vaginal cylinder for the definitive treatment of vaginal cancers. A total of 41 patients with vaginal cancer (24% primary vaginal and 76% recurrence from other gynecologic primaries) treated with definitive radiotherapy ± chemotherapy including image-based HDR brachytherapy with a multichannel vaginal cylinder were included in the study. Image-based brachytherapy was completed using either CT- (41%) or MR-based planning (59%) with each fraction. The high-risk clinical target volume was defined based on the pre- and postexternal beam radiotherapy gross tumor volume. Doses were converted to equivalent dose of 2Gy per fraction. Endpoints examined were dose-volume parameters and early clinical outcomes. The median high-risk clinical target volume was 24.2 cc (interquartile range [IQR], 12.6), with a median dose to 90% (D90) of 77.1 Gy (IQR, 3.4). The median dose to 2 cc (D(2 cc)) for the bladder, rectum, and sigmoid were 59.4 Gy (IQR, 5.6), 58.2 Gy (IQR, 4.1), and 52.3 Gy (IQR, 5.5), respectively. After a median followup of 16 months (range, 3-35), complete clinical response was documented in 98% of the patients. The 2-year local, regional, and distant control; and disease-free and overall survival were 93%, 100%, 81%, 78%, and 88%, respectively. The 2-year actuarial rate of late Grade 3 or higher toxicity was 4% overall with 0%, 0%, 0%, and 4% for vaginal, bladder, urethral, and gastrointestinal, respectively. Image-based HDR brachytherapy using an intracavitary multichannel cylinder seems feasible in definitive vaginal cancer treatment.

Preoperative predictive model of recovery of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy.,BJU international,BJU Int.,2015-03-30,"To build a predictive model of urinary continence recovery after radical prostatectomy (RP) that incorporates magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and clinical data. We conducted a retrospective review of data from 2,849 patients who underwent pelvic staging MRI before RP from November 2001 to June 2010. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between each MRI variable and continence at 6 or 12 months, adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and then used multivariable logistic regression to create our model. A nomogram was constructed using the multivariable logistic regression models. In all, 68% (1,742/2,559) and 82% (2,205/2,689) regained function at 6 and 12 months, respectively. In the base model, age, BMI and ASA score were significant predictors of continence at 6 or 12 months on univariate analysis (P < 0.005). Among the preoperative MRI measurements, membranous urethral length, which showed great significance, was incorporated into the base model to create the full model. For continence recovery at 6 months, the addition of membranous urethral length increased the area under the curve (AUC) to 0.664 for the validation set, an increase of 0.064 over the base model. For continence recovery at 12 months, the AUC was 0.674, an increase of 0.085 over the base model. Using our model, the likelihood of continence recovery increases with membranous urethral length and decreases with age, BMI and ASA score. This model could be used for patient counselling and for the identification of patients at high risk for urinary incontinence in whom to study changes in operative technique that improve urinary function after RP.",Journal Article,1758.0,28.0,"build predictive model urinary continence recovery radical prostatectomy RP incorporates magnetic resonance imaging MRI parameters clinical conducted retrospective review 2,849 patients underwent pelvic staging MRI RP November 2001 June 2010 logistic regression evaluate association MRI variable continence 6 12 months adjusting age body mass index BMI American Society Anesthesiologists ASA score multivariable logistic regression create model nomogram constructed multivariable logistic regression models 68 1,742/2,559 82 2,205/2,689 regained function 6 12 months respectively base model age BMI ASA score significant predictors continence 6 12 months univariate P 0.005 preoperative MRI measurements membranous urethral length showed great significance incorporated base model create model continence recovery 6 months addition membranous urethral length increased area curve AUC 0.664 validation set increase 0.064 base model continence recovery 12 months AUC 0.674 increase 0.085 base model model likelihood continence recovery increases membranous urethral length decreases age BMI ASA score model patient counselling identification patients high risk urinary incontinence changes operative technique improve urinary function RP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 5867, 8, 464, 202, 1, 1660, 7094, 1602, 50, 711, 1202, 1622, 17, 6175, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 1038, 2, 38, 74, 21, 426, 8, 459, 206, 1, 74, 29, 18, 16059, 7, 54, 208, 1110, 632, 704, 348, 1622, 29, 2868, 1758, 6, 1924, 1120, 21, 95, 812, 320, 6, 376, 3, 248, 59, 296, 704, 1347, 2, 7094, 28, 49, 15, 133, 53, 1358, 9, 89, 642, 782, 558, 1140, 2, 597, 1174, 1, 9558, 6453, 368, 2, 818, 95, 658, 812, 320, 6, 3736, 114, 202, 8, 1981, 10, 2776, 75, 3, 658, 812, 320, 274, 4, 62, 806, 14, 12585, 18, 15710, 2, 878, 18, 5286, 18, 15103, 17220, 343, 28, 49, 2, 133, 53, 106, 4, 3, 1782, 202, 89, 1140, 2, 6453, 368, 11, 93, 674, 1, 7094, 28, 49, 15, 133, 53, 23, 880, 65, 19, 13, 1614, 107, 3, 498, 704, 1685, 6300, 1318, 92, 224, 2797, 724, 10, 2449, 237, 3, 1782, 202, 6, 3736, 3, 1647, 202, 9, 7094, 1602, 28, 49, 53, 3, 352, 1, 6300, 1318, 101, 3, 965, 669, 3, 1496, 1376, 6, 13, 13025, 9, 3, 929, 916, 35, 344, 1, 13, 12893, 252, 3, 1782, 202, 9, 7094, 1602, 28, 133, 53, 3, 1376, 10, 13, 12258, 35, 344, 1, 13, 13639, 252, 3, 1782, 202, 75, 114, 202, 3, 1420, 1, 7094, 1602, 1106, 5, 6300, 1318, 2, 2140, 5, 89, 1140, 2, 6453, 368, 26, 202, 359, 40, 95, 9, 69, 13398, 2, 9, 3, 911, 1, 7, 28, 64, 43, 9, 1660, 6152, 4, 953, 6, 45, 400, 4, 1208, 1312, 17, 401, 1660, 343, 50, 1622]",1650.0,25682782,Preoperative predictive model recovery urinary continence radical prostatectomy,3,0.08571428571428572
Time Course and Accumulated Risk of Severe Urinary Adverse Events After High- Versus Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy With or Without External Beam Radiation Therapy.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-04-07,"Severe urinary adverse events (UAEs) include surgical treatment of urethral stricture, urinary incontinence, and radiation cystitis. We compared the incidence of grade 3 UAEs, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, after low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, as well as after LDR plus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and HDR plus EBRT. Men aged >65 years with nonmetastatic prostate cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who were treated with LDR (n=12,801), HDR (n=685), LDR plus EBRT (n=8518), or HDR plus EBRT (n=2392). The populations were balanced by propensity weighting, and the Kaplan-Meier incidence of severe UAEs was compared. Propensity-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the adjusted hazard of UAEs. These UAEs were compared with those in a cohort of men not treated for prostate cancer. Median follow-up was 4.3 years. At 8 years, the propensity-weighted cumulative UAE incidence was highest after HDR plus EBRT (26.6% [95% confidence interval, 23.8%-29.7%]) and lowest after LDR (15.7% [95% confidence interval, 14.8%-16.6%]). The absolute excess risk over nontreated controls at 8 years was 1.9%, 3.8%, 8.4%, and 12.9% for LDR, HDR, LDR plus EBRT, and HDR plus EBRT, respectively. These represent numbers needed to harm of 53, 26, 12, and 8 persons, respectively. The additional risk of development of a UAE related to treatment for LDR, LDR plus EBRT, and HDR plus EBRT was greatest within the 2 years after treatment and then continued to decline over time. Beyond 4 years, the risk of development of a new severe UAE matched the baseline risk of the control population for all treatments.

Accuracy of urethral frozen section during radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.,Urologic oncology,Urol. Oncol.,2016-07-16,"Our objective was to determine the accuracy of urethral frozen section (FS) by analyzing our clinical experience. A total of 298 patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer with benign or malignant urethral FS were identified between 2000 and 2012. Urethral FS were compared with rereviewed FS to calculate the positive and negative predictive values of the FS. To assess the ability of the positive FS to be cleared with further sampling/resection, FS were then compared with the final urethral margin. The cases of positive urethral FS were then specifically analyzed to assess rates of urethral recurrence and survival. All negative FS were confirmed to be negative on FS rereview and on final pathology, resulting in a NPV of 100%. Urethral FS were positive in 28 (8.7%) patients, of whom 2 (7%) were negative on FS rereview, yielding a positive predictive value of 93%. Both false positives were because of contamination of detached cancer from the bladder being present in the FS. After additional sampling/resection, the final margin was negative in 13 (46%) patients. A negative urethral FS reliably identifies individuals for whom urethrectomy is unnecessary and provides robust information for decision-making regarding the safety of orthotopic reconstruction. Nearly half of the patients with a positive FS were ultimately determined to have a negative final margin. Accordingly, we recommend that surgeons and pathologists discuss positive FS findings at the time of surgery and consider whether additional tissue should be analyzed in real time.",Evaluation Study,1284.0,2.0,objective determine accuracy urethral frozen section FS analyzing clinical experience total 298 patients undergoing radical cystectomy bladder benign malignant urethral FS identified 2000 2012 Urethral FS compared rereviewed FS calculate positive negative predictive values FS assess ability positive FS cleared sampling/resection FS compared final urethral margin cases positive urethral FS specifically assess rates urethral recurrence survival negative FS confirmed negative FS rereview final pathology resulting NPV 100 Urethral FS positive 28 8.7 patients 2 7 negative FS rereview yielding positive predictive value 93 false positives contamination detached bladder present FS additional sampling/resection final margin negative 13 46 patients negative urethral FS reliably identifies individuals urethrectomy unnecessary provides robust information decision-making safety orthotopic reconstruction Nearly half patients positive FS ultimately determined negative final margin Accordingly recommend surgeons pathologists discuss positive FS findings time surgery consider additional tissue real time,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[114, 461, 10, 6, 223, 3, 1190, 1, 3015, 2917, 4110, 20, 4449, 114, 38, 730, 8, 181, 1, 8651, 7, 479, 711, 1750, 9, 12, 5, 1002, 15, 393, 4110, 11, 108, 59, 1081, 2, 1195, 4110, 11, 72, 5, 20515, 4110, 6, 3232, 3, 109, 2, 199, 464, 1030, 1, 3, 4110, 6, 423, 3, 801, 1, 3, 109, 4110, 6, 40, 9266, 5, 195, 2874, 170, 4110, 11, 818, 72, 5, 3, 1457, 959, 3, 140, 1, 109, 4110, 11, 818, 1225, 311, 6, 423, 151, 1, 146, 2, 25, 62, 199, 4110, 11, 557, 6, 40, 199, 23, 4110, 26384, 2, 23, 1457, 1117, 1113, 4, 8, 6771, 1, 394, 4110, 11, 109, 4, 339, 66, 67, 7, 1, 953, 18, 67, 11, 199, 23, 4110, 26384, 4949, 8, 109, 464, 549, 1, 966, 110, 2133, 9837, 11, 408, 1, 9866, 1, 23931, 12, 29, 3, 486, 364, 4, 3, 4110, 50, 402, 2874, 170, 3, 1457, 959, 10, 199, 4, 233, 641, 7, 8, 199, 4110, 4092, 2953, 869, 9, 953, 15180, 16, 4224, 2, 777, 1922, 487, 9, 948, 1079, 666, 3, 367, 1, 2157, 1470, 1857, 1303, 1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 109, 4110, 11, 2050, 509, 6, 47, 8, 199, 1457, 959, 4705, 21, 2237, 17, 1613, 2, 3354, 1139, 109, 4110, 272, 28, 3, 98, 1, 152, 2, 2419, 317, 402, 246, 257, 40, 311, 4, 1589, 98]",1453.0,27432433,Accuracy urethral frozen section radical cystectomy bladder,3,0.08571428571428572
Erectile Dysfunction Treatment Following Radical Cystoprostatectomy: Analysis of a Nationwide Insurance Claims Database.,The journal of sexual medicine,J Sex Med,2017-04-29,"To improve care for patients after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP), focus on survivorship issues such as sexual function needs to increase. Previous studies have demonstrated the burden of erectile dysfunction (ED) after RCP to be as high as 89%. To determine the rates of ED treatment use (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, injectable therapies, urethral suppositories, vacuum erection devices, and penile prosthetics) in patients with bladder cancer before and after RCP to better understand current patterns of care. Men with bladder cancer undergoing RCP were identified in the MarketScan database (2010-2014). ED treatment use was assessed at baseline (during the 1 year before RCP) and at 6-month intervals (0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 months) after RCP. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of ED treatment use at 6-month intervals after RCP. ED treatment rates and predictors of ED treatment at 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24 month follow-up after RCP. At baseline, 6.5% of patients (77 of 1,176) used ED treatments. The rates of ED treatment use at 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, and 19 to 24 months after RCP were 15.2%, 12.7%, 8.1%, and 10.1% respectively. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors were the most commonly used treatment at all time points. In the multivariable model, predictors of ED treatment use at 0 to 6 months after RCP were age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.68-6.01), baseline ED treatment use (OR = 5.75, 95% CI = 3.08-10.72), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.13-2.61), and neobladder diversion (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.56-3.70). Baseline ED treatment use continued to be associated with ED treatment use at 6 to 12 months (OR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.42-13.10) and 13 to 18 months (OR = 8.99, 95% CI = 3.05-26.51) after RCP. While the burden of ED following RCP is known to be high, overall ED treatment rates are low. These findings suggest either ED treatment is low priority for RCP patients or education about potential ED therapies may not be commonly discussed with patients following RCP. Urologists should consider discussing sexual function more frequently with their RCP patients. Strengths include the use of a national claims database, which allows for longitudinal follow-up and detailed information on prescription medications and devices. Limitations include the lack of pathologic and oncologic outcomes data. ED treatment use after RCP is quite low. The strongest predictor of ED treatment use after RCP was baseline treatment use. These findings suggest ED treatment is a low priority for patients with RCP or education about potential ED therapies might not be commonly discussed with patients after RCP. Urologists should consider discussing sexual function more frequently with their patients undergoing RCP. Chappadi MR, Kates M, Sopko NA, et al.

Contemporary practice patterns and survival outcomes for locally advanced urethral malignancies: A National Cancer Database Analysis.,Urologic oncology,Urol. Oncol.,2017-08-10,"Primary urethral carcinoma (PUC) has an aggressive natural history; however, controversy exists regarding the role of multimodal therapy for its treatment. Our objective was to examine practice patterns and survival outcomes for locally advanced urethral cancers. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with T2-4 or N1-2M0 PUC with urothelial, squamous, or adenocarcinoma histology from 2004 to 2013. Temporal trends for receipt of local or definitive surgery, radiotherapy (XRT), and systemic therapy were assessed. Adjusting for clinicopathologic characteristics, we evaluated the effect of tumor stage and histology on receipt of definitive multimodal therapy (cystectomy + chemotherapy ± XRT) and effects of treatment on overall survival. A total of 1,749 patients met inclusion criteria (22.2% adenocarcinoma, 29.3% squamous, and 48.5% urothelial). Only 29.6% underwent cystectomy ± XRT, and 15.6% underwent definitive multimodal therapy. Following adjustment, older patients (age 50-75: odds ratio [OR] = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.28-0.63]; age 75+: OR = 0.06 [95% CI: 0.03-0.13]) and those with squamous histology (OR = 0.46 [95% CI: 0.3-0.7]) were less likely to receive definitive multimodal therapy. More advanced stage (T3: OR = 1.66 [95% CI: 1.15-2.41]; T4: OR = 3.57 [95% CI: 2.47-5.16]); and N2 status (OR = 1.88 [95% CI: 1.27-2.78]) were more likely to receive definitive multimodal therapy. On adjusted analysis, an overall survival benefit was only observed with definitive multimodal therapy for PUC of urothelial origin (hazard ratio = 0.61 [95% CI: 0.45-0.83]). Despite a survival benefit, most patients with locally advanced PUC do not undergo definitive multimodal therapy. We advocate for a multidisciplinary-based treatment approach for these patients.

Topography of Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radiation Therapy: A Detailed Mapping Study of Salvage Radical Prostatectomy Specimens.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2017-08-26,"In men who do not respond to initial radiation therapy, accurate knowledge of the site of cancer recurrence or persistence is necessary to understand treatment failure. We evaluated the pathologic characteristics of recurrent/persistent prostate cancer with tumor maps from the whole-mount slides of salvage radical prostatectomies performed between 2000 and 2014. Of 216 consecutive patients, detailed tumor maps were available for 77. Sixty-nine patients (90%) were found to have tumor in the apex, of which 46% occurred in the most apical 3mm. Fifty-three patients (69%) had tumors at a distance of ≤5mm from the urethra. Five patients had tumor directly involving the urethra, all of whom had urethral invasion at the apex. Seminal vesicle involvement was seen in 32 patients (42%), two of whom had tumor only in the seminal vesicles. Sixty-two patients (81%) had tumors in the distal apex, periurethral area, or seminal vesicles, that is, areas that are not routinely biopsied. Targeting these areas could improve the accuracy of biopsy when cancer recurrence is suspected. When recurrence is suspected, clinicians should include biopsy of the distal apex, areas surrounding the urethra, and seminal vesicles.

"Efficacy of pudendal nerve block for alleviation of catheter-related bladder discomfort in male patients undergoing lower urinary tract surgeries: A randomized, controlled, double-blind trial.",Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),2017-12-01,"Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) to an indwelling urinary catheter is defined as a painful urethral discomfort, resistant to conventional opioid therapy, decreasing the quality of postoperative recovery. According to anatomy, the branches of sacral somatic nerves form the afferent nerves of the urethra and bladder triangle, which deriving from the ventral rami of the second to fourth sacral spinal nerves, innervating the urethral muscles and sphincter of the perineum and pelvic floor; as well as providing sensation to the penis and clitoris in males and females, which including the urethra and bladder triangle. Based on this theoretical knowledge, we formed a hypothesis that CRBD could be prevented by pudendal nerve block. To evaluate if bilateral nerve stimulator-guided pudendal nerve block could relieve CRBD through urethra discomfort alleviation. Single-center randomized parallel controlled, double blind trial conducted at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. One hundred and eighty 2 male adult patients under general anesthesia undergoing elective trans-urethral resection of prostate (TURP) or trans-urethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Around 4 out of 182 were excluded, 178 patients were randomly allocated into pudendal and control groups, using computer-generated randomized numbers in a sealed envelope method. A total of 175 patients completed the study. Pudendal group received general anesthesia along with nerve-stimulator-guided bilateral pudendal nerve block and control group received general anesthesia only.

Focal MRI-Guided Salvage High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in Patients With Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer.,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Technol. Cancer Res. Treat.,2017-12-05,"Whole-gland salvage treatment of radiorecurrent prostate cancer has a high rate of severe toxicity. The standard of care in case of a biochemical recurrence is androgen deprivation treatment, which is associated with morbidity and negative effects on quality of life. A salvage treatment with acceptable toxicity might postpone the start of androgen deprivation treatment, might have a positive influence on the patients' quality of life, and might even be curative. Here, toxicity and biochemical outcome are described after magnetic resonance imaging-guided focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy in patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer. Seventeen patients with pathologically proven locally recurrent prostate cancer were treated with focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy in a single 19-Gy fraction using magnetic resonance imaging for treatment guidance. Primary radiotherapy consisted of external beam radiotherapy or low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Tumors were delineated with Ga-68-prostate-specific membrane antigen or F18-choline positron emission tomography in combination with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 10 ng/mL at the time of recurrence and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of ≥12 months. Toxicity was measured by using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Eight of 17 patients had follow-up interval of at least 1 year. At a median follow-up interval of 10 months (range 3-40 months), 1 patient experienced a biochemical recurrence according to the Phoenix criteria, and prostate-specific membrane antigen testing revealed that this was due to a distant nodal metastasis.

Optimizing the Role of Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Urethral Cancer Based on Histology and Disease Extent.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-08-07,"Urethral cancer is rare, with limited data guiding treatment. A national hospital-based registry was used to evaluate the role of local therapy in these patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who, between 2004 and 20013, received a diagnosis of T0-4N0-2 M0 urethral cancer. Local therapy was radiation therapy (RT), surgery (S), or S and RT (S+RT). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the impact of therapy type on overall survival (primary endpoint). Subgroup analysis by extent of disease (early stage [T0-2 N0] vs locally advanced [T3+ or N+]) and histology was performed. In our study, 2614 patients had a median follow-up of 28 months. Three-year overall survival was 54%. In 501 patients with locally advanced disease, S+RT was associated with improved survival versus S alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.80). There was no difference for patients with squamous cell carcinoma by treatment type, but patients with adenocarcinoma (RT vs S: HR 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.60) or transitional cell carcinoma (S+RT vs S: HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.26-0.77) had improved OS with RT as part of treatment. In 1705 early-stage patients, there was no association with survival when comparing S+RT versus S. For patients with locally advanced disease and transitional cell carcinoma undergoing S, the addition of RT is associated with improved overall survival and should be considered. An RT-based approach may be preferred for adenocarcinoma, but there was no clear association with survival by therapy type for squamous cell carcinoma.

Patient and Dosimetric Predictors of Genitourinary and Bowel Quality of Life After Prostate SBRT: Secondary Analysis of a Multi-institutional Trial.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-07-26,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an emerging option for localized prostate cancer. However, there are no standard dosimetric guidelines, and normal tissue tolerances for extreme hypofractionation are not well defined. We analyzed dosimetric correlations with patient-reported urinary and bowel quality of life (QOL) on a prospective trial. Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 18 institutions were enrolled on a phase 2 trial from 2007 to 2012 and treated using robotic SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 fractions on consecutive days. No androgen deprivation was used. Patients received simulation with Foley catheter for urethral delineation. The clinical target volume was prostate (low-risk patients) or prostate plus 1 cm of proximal seminal vesicles (intermediate-risk patients). Multiple dosimetric measures for urethra, bladder, and rectum were prospectively recorded. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite was assessed before and after treatment at protocol-specific time points. Linear regression was used to assess factors associated with QOL at 1 month and 2 years. A total of 259 patients were enrolled. QOL data were available for 98%, 96%, and 84% at baseline, 1 month, and 2 years, respectively. Median age was 69 years. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate and clinical target volume size were associated with 2-year urinary incontinence. There was a trend toward worse 2-year obstruction/irritation in older patients on multivariable analysis. Bladder and urethral doses were not associated with either 1-month or 2-year urinary QOL. In contrast, rectum maximum dose was associated with both 1-month and 2-year bowel QOL. At 2 years, the proportion with moderate or big overall bowel problems (as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26) was significantly higher in patients with rectum maximum dose greater than versus less than the median 37.4 Gy (11% vs 2%, Fisher's exact test P = .008). These results provide novel data that contribute to a better understanding of patient and dosimetric factors associated with adverse QOL effects from prostate SBRT.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",544.0,5.0,Stereotactic body radiation therapy SBRT emerging option localized prostate standard dosimetric guidelines normal tissue tolerances extreme hypofractionation defined dosimetric correlations patient-reported urinary bowel quality life QOL prospective trial Patients low- intermediate-risk prostate 18 institutions enrolled phase 2 trial 2007 2012 treated robotic SBRT 38 Gy 4 fractions consecutive days androgen deprivation Patients received simulation Foley catheter urethral delineation clinical target volume prostate low-risk patients prostate plus 1 cm proximal seminal vesicles intermediate-risk patients Multiple dosimetric measures urethra bladder rectum prospectively recorded QOL Expanded Prostate Index Composite assessed treatment protocol-specific time points Linear regression assess factors associated QOL 1 month 2 years total 259 patients enrolled QOL available 98 96 84 baseline 1 month 2 years respectively Median age 69 years Prior transurethral resection prostate clinical target volume size associated 2-year urinary incontinence trend worse 2-year obstruction/irritation older patients multivariable Bladder urethral doses associated 1-month 2-year urinary QOL contrast rectum maximum dose associated 1-month 2-year bowel QOL 2 years proportion moderate big overall bowel problems defined Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26 significantly higher patients rectum maximum dose greater versus median 37.4 Gy 11 vs 2 Fisher 's exact test P .008 provide novel contribute better understanding patient dosimetric factors associated adverse QOL effects prostate SBRT,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1729, 642, 121, 36, 1415, 16, 35, 1478, 1501, 9, 909, 12, 137, 125, 32, 77, 260, 3187, 677, 2, 295, 246, 35967, 9, 5611, 7614, 32, 44, 149, 395, 21, 311, 3187, 2553, 5, 69, 210, 1660, 2, 1659, 372, 1, 358, 1001, 23, 8, 482, 160, 7, 5, 154, 15, 919, 43, 12, 29, 203, 1764, 11, 346, 23, 8, 124, 18, 160, 29, 1307, 6, 1195, 2, 73, 75, 2895, 1415, 6, 519, 381, 4, 39, 1550, 23, 935, 162, 77, 687, 1868, 10, 95, 7, 103, 4026, 5, 26513, 3925, 9, 5529, 3, 38, 283, 433, 10, 154, 43, 7, 15, 349, 14, 494, 1, 2805, 4786, 7634, 919, 43, 7, 232, 3187, 1018, 9, 9358, 2, 3660, 11, 1143, 1872, 1001, 75, 3, 2064, 12, 558, 3308, 10, 275, 348, 2, 50, 24, 28, 1182, 112, 98, 862, 1646, 320, 10, 95, 6, 423, 130, 41, 5, 1001, 28, 14, 811, 2, 18, 60, 8, 181, 1, 7696, 7, 11, 346, 1001, 74, 11, 390, 9, 1096, 921, 2, 874, 28, 330, 14, 811, 2, 18, 60, 106, 52, 89, 10, 790, 60, 324, 5079, 170, 1, 3, 2, 38, 283, 433, 444, 11, 41, 5, 18, 111, 1660, 6152, 125, 10, 8, 853, 1317, 639, 18, 111, 3191, 11765, 4, 434, 7, 23, 658, 65, 2, 415, 11, 44, 41, 5, 361, 14, 811, 15, 18, 111, 1660, 1001, 4, 748, 3660, 689, 61, 10, 41, 5, 110, 14, 811, 2, 18, 111, 1659, 1001, 28, 18, 60, 3, 920, 5, 1163, 15, 10864, 63, 1659, 2408, 22, 395, 20, 2064, 12, 558, 3308, 432, 10, 97, 142, 4, 7, 5, 3660, 689, 61, 378, 76, 185, 299, 76, 3, 52, 567, 39, 381, 175, 105, 18, 3135, 292, 2472, 412, 19, 2155, 46, 99, 377, 229, 74, 17, 1248, 6, 8, 380, 612, 1, 69, 2, 3187, 130, 41, 5, 290, 1001, 176, 29, 1415]",1981.0,30056080,Patient Dosimetric Predictors Genitourinary Bowel Quality Life Prostate SBRT Secondary Multi-institutional Trial,1,0.02857142857142857
ICUD-SIU International Consultation on Bladder Cancer 2017: management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.,World journal of urology,World J Urol,2018-08-14,"To provide a summary of the Third International Consultation on Bladder Cancer recommendations for the management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A detailed review of the literature was performed focusing on original articles for the management of NMIBC. An international committee assessed and graded the articles based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine system. The entire spectrum of NMIBC was covered such as prognostic factors of recurrence and progression, risk stratification, staging, management of positive urine cytology with negative white light cystoscopy, indications of bladder and prostatic urethral biopsies, management of Ta low grade (LG) and high risk tumors (Ta high grade [HG], T1, carcinoma in situ [CIS]), impact of BCG strain and host on outcomes, management of complications of intravesical therapy, role of alternative therapies, indications for early cystectomy, surveillance strategies, and new treatments. The working group provides several recommendations on the management of NMIBC.

Cystic metastasis of prostate cancer: A case report.,Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),2018-12-01,"Prostate cancer often metastasizes (most commonly to the pelvic lymph nodes and axial skeleton); however, metastases to the pelvic cavity as a solitary mass are unusual. While metastatic prostate cancer is unconventional in pelvic cavity, cystic pelvic lesions are even more scarce. Accurate identification of cystic metastasis can be helpful in management of prostate cancer. A 64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to urethral irritation symptom and dysuria. In addition to prostate cancer, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate revealed that a cystic mass was located at right pelvic cavity. Histopathological examination diagnosed the pelvic cystic mass as metastasis from prostatic cancer. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated Calretinin (+), D2-40 (-), Ki-67 (10%+), Vimentin (-), CK-pan (+), CK5/6 (-), WT-1 (-), PSA (+), SALL4 (-), Villin (-), CK20 (-), CK7 (-), PAX-8 (-), and TTF-1 (-). The cystic mass was removed. Primary cancer of the prostate was reserved as well. After discharge, the patient underwent in a two-year androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) treatment. After 13 months of discharge, no disease progression was found in the patient. Although cystic prostate cancer is rare, the occurrence possibility should be considered when cystic lesions are accompanied with prostate cancer.",Case Reports,416.0,0.0,Prostate metastasizes commonly pelvic lymph nodes axial skeleton metastases pelvic cavity solitary mass unusual metastatic prostate unconventional pelvic cavity cystic pelvic lesions scarce Accurate identification cystic metastasis helpful management prostate 64-year-old male admitted hospital urethral irritation symptom dysuria addition prostate abdominal computed tomography CT scanning magnetic resonance imaging MRI prostate revealed cystic mass located right pelvic cavity Histopathological examination diagnosed pelvic cystic mass metastasis prostatic Immunohistochemistry demonstrated Calretinin D2-40 Ki-67 10 Vimentin CK-pan CK5/6 WT-1 PSA SALL4 Villin CK20 CK7 PAX-8 TTF-1 cystic mass removed Primary prostate reserved discharge patient underwent two-year androgen deprivation therapy ADT treatment 13 months discharge disease progression patient cystic prostate rare occurrence possibility considered cystic lesions accompanied prostate,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[12, 629, 10151, 96, 841, 6, 3, 1110, 263, 502, 2, 5229, 9160, 137, 196, 6, 3, 1110, 2405, 22, 8, 3144, 782, 32, 4015, 369, 113, 12, 16, 18146, 4, 1110, 2405, 2965, 1110, 406, 32, 871, 80, 8113, 1481, 911, 1, 2965, 278, 122, 40, 3951, 4, 284, 1, 12, 8, 660, 111, 1095, 1045, 10, 4319, 6, 114, 702, 520, 6, 11765, 934, 2, 18282, 4, 352, 6, 12, 1467, 1220, 872, 425, 3702, 2, 1484, 1535, 270, 704, 1, 3, 553, 17, 8, 2965, 782, 10, 2308, 28, 1913, 1110, 2405, 4370, 1385, 265, 3, 1110, 2965, 782, 22, 278, 29, 3329, 12, 888, 99, 264, 28348, 4171, 327, 2311, 598, 79, 4840, 4925, 3055, 13978, 49, 1820, 14, 534, 16439, 19793, 10821, 12097, 12691, 66, 2, 4583, 14, 3, 2965, 782, 10, 2264, 86, 12, 1, 3, 10, 6468, 22, 149, 50, 2993, 3, 69, 208, 4, 8, 100, 111, 687, 1868, 36, 1360, 24, 50, 233, 53, 1, 2993, 77, 34, 91, 10, 204, 4, 3, 69, 242, 2965, 12, 16, 622, 3, 2291, 2526, 257, 40, 515, 198, 2965, 406, 32, 2756, 5, 12]",1202.0,30558081,Cystic metastasis prostate case report,0,0.0
Pelvic Complications After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy and Their Management: An International Collaborative Narrative Review.,European urology,Eur. Urol.,2018-12-17,"Radiotherapy used for treating localized prostate cancer is effective at prolonging cancer-specific and overall survival. Still, acute and late pelvic toxicities are a concern, with gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) sequelae being most common as well as other pelvic complications. To present a critical review of the literature regarding the incidence and risk factors of pelvic toxicity following primary radiotherapy for prostate cancer and to provide a narrative review regarding its management. A collaborative narrative review of the literature from 2010 to present was conducted. Regardless of the modality used, the incidence of acute high-grade pelvic toxicity is low following conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). After moderate hypofractionation, the crude cumulative incidences for late grade 3 or higher (G3+) GI and GU complications are as high as 6% and 7%, respectively. After extreme hypofractionation, the 5-yr incidences of G2+ GU and GI toxicities are 3-9% and 0-4%, respectively. Following brachytherapy monotherapy, crude rates of late G3+ GU toxicity range from 6% to 8%, while late GI toxicity is rare. With combination therapy (EBRT and brachytherapy), the cumulative incidence of late GU toxicity is high, between 18% and 31%; however, the prevalence is lower at 4-14%. Whole pelvic radiotherapy remains a controversial treatment option as there is increased G3+ GI toxicity compared with prostate-only treatment, with no overall survival benefit. Proton beam therapy appears to have similar toxicity to photon therapies currently in use. With respect to specific complications, urinary obstruction and urethral stricture are the most common severe urinary toxicities. Rectal and urinary bleeding can be recurrent long-term toxicities. The risk of hip fracture is also increased following prostate radiotherapy. The literature is mixed on the risk of in-field secondary pelvic malignancies following prostate radiotherapy. Urinary and GI fistulas are rare complications. Management of these toxicities may require invasive treatment and reconstructive surgery for refractory and severe symptoms. There has been progress in the delivery of radiotherapy, enabling the administration of higher doses with minimal tradeoff in terms of slightly increased or equal toxicity. There is a need to focus future improvements in radiotherapy on sparing critical structures to reduce GU and GI morbidities. While complications such as fistulae, bone toxicity, and secondary malignancy are rare, there is a need for higher-quality studies assessing these outcomes and their management. In this report, we review the literature regarding pelvic complications following modern primary prostate cancer radiotherapy and their management. Modern radiotherapy technologies have enabled the administration of higher doses with minimal increases in toxicity. Overall, high-grade long-term toxicity following prostate radiotherapy is uncommon. Management of late high-grade pelvic toxicities can be challenging, with patients often requiring invasive therapies for refractory cases.",Journal Article,400.0,3.0,Radiotherapy treating localized prostate effective prolonging cancer-specific overall survival acute late pelvic toxicities concern gastrointestinal GI genitourinary GU sequelae common pelvic complications present critical review literature incidence risk factors pelvic toxicity following primary radiotherapy prostate provide narrative review management collaborative narrative review literature 2010 present conducted Regardless modality incidence acute high-grade pelvic toxicity low following conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy EBRT moderate hypofractionation crude cumulative incidences late grade 3 higher G3+ GI GU complications high 6 7 respectively extreme hypofractionation 5-yr incidences G2+ GU GI toxicities 3-9 0-4 respectively Following brachytherapy monotherapy crude rates late G3+ GU toxicity range 6 8 late GI toxicity rare combination therapy EBRT brachytherapy cumulative incidence late GU toxicity high 18 31 prevalence lower 4-14 pelvic radiotherapy remains controversial treatment option increased G3+ GI toxicity compared prostate-only treatment overall survival benefit Proton beam therapy appears similar toxicity photon therapies currently use respect specific complications urinary obstruction urethral stricture common severe urinary toxicities Rectal urinary bleeding recurrent long-term toxicities risk hip fracture increased following prostate radiotherapy literature mixed risk in-field secondary pelvic malignancies following prostate radiotherapy Urinary GI fistulas rare complications Management toxicities require invasive treatment reconstructive surgery refractory severe symptoms progress delivery radiotherapy enabling administration higher doses minimal tradeoff terms slightly increased equal toxicity need focus future improvements radiotherapy sparing critical structures reduce GU GI morbidities complications fistulae bone toxicity secondary malignancy rare need higher-quality studies assessing outcomes management report review literature pelvic complications following modern primary prostate radiotherapy management Modern radiotherapy technologies enabled administration higher doses minimal increases toxicity Overall high-grade long-term toxicity following prostate radiotherapy uncommon Management late high-grade pelvic toxicities challenging patients requiring invasive therapies refractory cases,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"[310, 95, 9, 1367, 909, 12, 16, 323, 28, 5559, 12, 112, 2, 63, 25, 1234, 286, 2, 807, 1110, 385, 32, 8, 2893, 5, 2104, 2, 4109, 5581, 4156, 486, 96, 186, 22, 149, 22, 127, 1110, 521, 6, 364, 8, 740, 206, 1, 3, 789, 666, 3, 287, 2, 43, 130, 1, 1110, 155, 366, 86, 310, 9, 12, 2, 6, 377, 8, 8963, 206, 666, 211, 284, 8, 3737, 8963, 206, 1, 3, 789, 29, 1120, 6, 364, 10, 426, 1583, 1, 3, 1396, 95, 3, 287, 1, 286, 64, 88, 1110, 155, 16, 154, 366, 6846, 3950, 1455, 1345, 310, 1883, 50, 1163, 7614, 3, 6622, 967, 3981, 9, 807, 88, 27, 15, 142, 5578, 2104, 2, 5581, 521, 32, 22, 64, 22, 49, 2, 67, 106, 50, 5611, 7614, 3, 33, 2830, 3981, 1, 3774, 5581, 2, 2104, 385, 32, 27, 83, 2, 13, 39, 106, 366, 1536, 1411, 6622, 151, 1, 807, 5578, 5581, 155, 184, 29, 49, 6, 66, 369, 807, 2104, 155, 16, 622, 5, 150, 36, 1883, 2, 1536, 3, 967, 287, 1, 807, 5581, 155, 16, 64, 59, 203, 2, 456, 137, 3, 1078, 16, 280, 28, 39, 213, 902, 1110, 310, 469, 8, 2010, 24, 1501, 22, 125, 16, 101, 5578, 2104, 155, 72, 5, 1364, 158, 24, 5, 77, 63, 25, 247, 2095, 1345, 36, 1233, 6, 47, 288, 155, 6, 4216, 235, 694, 4, 119, 5, 2184, 6, 112, 521, 1660, 3191, 2, 6673, 32, 3, 96, 186, 905, 1660, 385, 2, 1660, 2294, 122, 40, 387, 319, 337, 385, 3, 43, 1, 5628, 3956, 16, 120, 101, 366, 310, 3, 789, 16, 1739, 23, 3, 43, 1, 4, 1067, 568, 1110, 441, 366, 310, 1660, 2, 2104, 13244, 32, 622, 521, 284, 1, 46, 385, 68, 1353, 416, 24, 2, 8060, 152, 9, 430, 2, 905, 507, 125, 71, 85, 1466, 4, 3, 989, 1, 310, 5257, 3, 634, 1, 142, 415, 5, 1048, 24833, 4, 1794, 1, 3223, 101, 15, 2997, 155, 125, 16, 8, 594, 6, 1222, 508, 1474, 4, 310, 23, 1851, 740, 2414, 6, 969, 5581, 2, 2104, 5655, 369, 521, 225, 22, 17809, 155, 2, 568, 710, 32, 622, 125, 16, 8, 594, 9, 142, 372, 94, 1977, 46, 123, 2, 136, 284, 4, 26, 414, 21, 206, 3, 789, 666, 1110, 521, 366, 2366, 86, 12, 310, 2, 136, 284, 2366, 310, 2590, 47, 4387, 3, 634, 1, 142, 415, 5, 1048, 1106, 4, 155, 63, 64, 88, 319, 337, 155, 366, 310, 16, 2052, 284, 1, 807, 64, 88, 1110, 385, 122, 40, 1950, 5, 7, 629, 1888, 416, 235, 9, 430, 140]",2965.0,30573316,Pelvic Complications Prostate Radiation Therapy Management International Collaborative Narrative Review,0,0.0
