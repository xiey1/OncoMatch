Sentinel node biopsy in vulvar and vaginal melanoma: presentation of six cases and a literature review.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2002-11-01,"Urogenital melanoma is a rare neoplasm with poor prognosis. Its management in the past involved radical vulvectomy and complete bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an accurate low-morbidity procedure when used in the context of cutaneous melanoma. However, prophylactic lymphadenectomy has not been shown to improve survival of melanoma patients. We wanted to determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with female urogenital melanoma as a staging procedure. Six patients with vulvar or vaginal melanomas underwent preoperative lymphatic mapping with (99m)Tc-labeled sulfur colloid followed by sentinel lymphadenectomy. In addition, we reviewed the literature on the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy in urogenital tract melanomas. One or more sentinel nodes were identified in all six patients by lymphoscintigraphy. All patients underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy, except for one patient with a deep vaginal melanoma that drained to pelvic nodes. The five successful cases had unilateral drainage patterns. None of the sentinel lymph nodes excised had tumor invasion. Combined with five other patients from the published literature, the success rate of localizing sentinel lymph nodes in the patients with urogenital melanoma approaches 100%. This experience, plus reports of a small number of patients from three similar studies, supports the impression that sentinel lymph node biopsy is feasible for vulvar and vaginal melanoma.",Journal Article,6290.0,59.0,Urogenital melanoma rare neoplasm poor prognosis management past involved radical vulvectomy complete bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy Sentinel lymph node biopsy accurate low-morbidity procedure context cutaneous melanoma prophylactic lymphadenectomy shown improve survival melanoma patients wanted determine feasibility sentinel lymph node biopsy patients female urogenital melanoma staging procedure patients vulvar vaginal melanomas underwent preoperative lymphatic mapping 99m Tc-labeled sulfur colloid followed sentinel lymphadenectomy addition reviewed literature application sentinel lymph node biopsy urogenital tract melanomas sentinel nodes identified patients lymphoscintigraphy patients underwent sentinel lymphadenectomy patient deep vaginal melanoma drained pelvic nodes successful cases unilateral drainage patterns sentinel lymph nodes excised invasion Combined patients published literature success rate localizing sentinel lymph nodes patients urogenital melanoma approaches 100 experience plus reports small number patients similar studies supports impression sentinel lymph node biopsy feasible vulvar vaginal melanoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[15162, 16, 8, 622, 2131, 5, 334, 356, 211, 284, 4, 3, 1219, 646, 711, 22043, 2, 236, 1607, 30333, 2048, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 16, 35, 1481, 154, 787, 1299, 198, 95, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 1486, 137, 1862, 2048, 71, 44, 85, 443, 6, 401, 25, 1, 7, 21, 7931, 6, 223, 3, 1437, 1, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 4, 7, 5, 1061, 15162, 22, 8, 632, 1299, 437, 7, 5, 15, 1965, 208, 498, 2936, 2568, 5, 6314, 3072, 2841, 10266, 7245, 370, 20, 1323, 2048, 4, 352, 21, 446, 3, 789, 23, 3, 1581, 1, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 4, 15162, 1696, 1965, 104, 15, 80, 1323, 502, 11, 108, 4, 62, 437, 7, 20, 6849, 62, 7, 208, 1323, 2048, 2187, 9, 104, 69, 5, 8, 2369, 17, 24458, 6, 1110, 502, 3, 365, 1401, 140, 42, 3208, 3528, 764, 1292, 1, 3, 1323, 263, 502, 5076, 42, 30, 578, 397, 5, 365, 127, 7, 29, 3, 983, 789, 3, 1825, 116, 1, 14384, 1323, 263, 502, 4, 3, 7, 5, 15162, 611, 394, 26, 730, 349, 1198, 1, 8, 302, 207, 1, 7, 29, 169, 288, 94, 2304, 3, 8925, 17, 1323, 263, 289, 411, 16, 1313, 9, 2]",1380.0,12417504,Sentinel node biopsy vulvar vaginal melanoma presentation cases literature review,0,0.0

A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with regionally advanced vulvar adenocarcinoma, with bulky involvement of bilateral groin lymph nodes, and associated extramammary Paget's disease. Initial therapy consisted of multiagent chemotherapy and vulvar and groin irradiation, followed by radical vulvectomy with groin and pelvic lymph node dissection. She subsequently developed widely metastatic disease including brain, pulmonary, hepatic, osseus, and subcutaneous lesions. Treatment with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) resulted in dramatic regression of metastatic lesions and marked improvement in quality-of-life.

Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia: treatment by carbon dioxide laser and risk factors for failure.,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",Eur. J. Obstet. Gynecol. Reprod. Biol.,2003-01-01,"To evaluate the effectiveness of CO(2) laser ablation of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) and to define prognostic factors. Medical records of 24 patients with VAIN II or III, treated by CO(2) laser ablation from 1990 to 1998 were reviewed. The grade, location, and focality of the lesions, the age, follow-up period and menopausal status of the patients, the power and duration of laser ablation, the presence of concurrent cervical or vulvar neoplasia or previous hysterectomy were evaluated as possible prognostic factors. Ablations of the VAIN were successfully accomplished in all of the patients with a mean period of 25.2+10.2 min, including additional simultaneous ablations of the cervix or vulva in eight (33.3%) patients. There was no early or late major complication. VAIN was completely eliminated in 17 (70.8%) patients after the first and in 19 (79.2%) patients after multiple episodes of ablation with a mean follow-up of 26.7+19.6 months. VAIN progressed to invasive vaginal carcinoma in one woman. None of the evaluated prognostic factors was found to be related to the persistence or recurrence.

We report a case in which a clinically inapparent invasive lesion was discovered on reexcision of microscopically persistent vulvar Paget's disease. A 58-year-old woman presented with a diagnosis of vulvar Paget's disease. A wide local excision of the lesion was performed and pathologic analysis revealed microscopic Paget's disease at two of the margins. The patient returned for a follow-up 4 months later and a vulvar biopsy revealing persistent Paget's cells was obtained from the area of the prior microscopically positive surgical margin. A reexcision was performed from the normal-appearing vulva and invasive vulvar carcinoma was noted in this specimen. This case demonstrates several concerning aspects of this disease, most important of which is that the clinically apparent lesion did not contain the clinically significant invasive lesion.

Long-term outcome of perianal Paget's disease.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,Dis. Colon Rectum,2003-05-01,"Extramammary Paget's disease of the perianal region is a rare finding that often results in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although the natural history of the disease is not well characterized, it historically has been associated with other cancers. This study summarizes the history and treatment of all patients diagnosed with perianal Paget's disease at a single institution. Charts of all patients with a diagnosis of extramammary Paget's disease of the perianal region confirmed or treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1950 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients with vulvar Paget's disease or Bowen's disease were excluded except when Paget's disease of the perianal region was diagnosed first. Whenever possible, follow-up information was updated. Estimates of overall and disease-free survival were made by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Twenty-seven patients with a median age of 63 years were diagnosed with perianal Paget's disease. Most patients (74 percent) were treated with wide excision. Local recurrence occurred in 37 percent of all patients treated and in 30 percent of patients (6/20) undergoing a wide excision as part of their treatment. An invasive component was identified in 44 percent of patients (12/27) with perianal Paget's disease. Six patients (22 percent) required a colostomy as part of the treatment for their disease. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was used in 22 percent of patients (6/27) who had more aggressive disease. At a median follow-up of 67 months, 56 percent (15/27) had no evidence of disease, and two patients had died of metastatic disease. The overall and disease-free survival at five years was 59 and 64 percent, respectively, which decreased to 33 and 39 percent, respectively, by ten years. Perianal Paget's disease is a rare finding even at a large referral center.

Groin recurrence in patients with vulvar cancer with negative nodes on superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-09-01,"The objective of this study was to investigate the cause of groin recurrence in patients with vulvar cancer who had negative nodes in their superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy (SIL) specimens. The records of patients with vulvar cancer treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1986 and 1997 were reviewed to identify patients with squamous histology, clinical and surgical stage I or II, depth of invasion greater than 1 mm, and primary treatment consisting of radical wide excision and SIL. One hundred four patients met these criteria. Among these, nine experienced recurrent disease that involved one or both of the groins. All of the original hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides were reviewed by one pathologist (AM). Then, each paraffin block containing nodal tissue was recut at 40 microm intervals to obtain five sections for H&E staining and two unstained sections to be used for cytokeratin immunostaining if necessary. The median age at diagnosis and primary surgery was 65 years and the median depth of invasion was 4 mm. Seven patients underwent bilateral, and two underwent unilateral, groin dissections. The median number of lymph nodes removed per groin was seven. The median time to recurrence was 22 months. A total of 785 additional H&E-stained slides were prepared and examined at 100x and 400x magnification. No micrometastases were identified, and there were no other suspicious findings. Therefore, immunohistochemical staining was not performed. At recurrence, one patient had a biopsy only, and eight had attempted surgical resection. In two patients, tumor was identified in fibroadipose tissue only; no lymph nodes were identified. Among the other six patients, the median number of lymph nodes resected at the time of the recurrence was five (range 1 to 10). At last report, six patients had died and three were alive and free of disease. Median follow-up for survivors was 63 months (range 42 to 71). These data strongly suggest that groin relapse in patients with negative nodes on SIL is caused by metastatic disease in unresected inguinal nodes. SIL as performed on the patients in this study did not eliminate all sites of nodal metastasis.",Journal Article,5986.0,63.0,objective investigate cause groin recurrence patients vulvar negative nodes superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy SIL specimens records patients vulvar treated M.

p16 expression in squamous lesions of the female genital tract.,Journal of molecular histology,J. Mol. Histol.,2004-02-01,"The aim of this study was to examine the role of p16 in the pathogenesis of squamous carcinoma of the gynecologic tract. Squamous carcinoma and carcinoma in situ from the female genital tract were examined for the expression of p16 by paraffin immunohistochemistry. About 74% (40/54) of cases showed p16 expression. By primary site, 77% (23/30) of cervical, 67% (6/9) of vaginal and 85% (11/13) of vulvar primaries expressed p16, but two endometrial primary squamous carcinomas were negative (0/2). In addition, p16 was not identified in non-dysplastic tissue and low grade dysplasia. In cases where there were matched vaginal or vulvar and cervical primaries in a given patient, there was concordant positive p16 expression. It is concluded that p16 is frequently expressed in squamous carcinoma of the cervix, vagina and vulva, but not seen in cases of benign and low grade lesions. It may be a marker of transformation from a low to a high grade lesion. More cases of endometrial primaries need to be studied to see if these evolve by a p16-independent pathway.",Journal Article,5833.0,8.0,aim examine role p16 pathogenesis squamous carcinoma gynecologic tract Squamous carcinoma carcinoma situ female genital tract examined expression p16 paraffin immunohistochemistry 74 40/54 cases showed p16 expression primary site 77 23/30 cervical 67 6/9 vaginal 85 11/13 vulvar primaries expressed p16 endometrial primary squamous carcinomas negative 0/2 addition p16 identified non-dysplastic tissue low grade dysplasia cases matched vaginal vulvar cervical primaries given patient concordant positive p16 expression concluded p16 frequently expressed squamous carcinoma cervix vagina vulva seen cases benign low grade lesions marker transformation low high grade lesion cases endometrial primaries need studied evolve p16-independent pathway,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 1004, 3, 200, 1, 1932, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 691, 134, 1, 3, 1512, 1696, 691, 134, 2, 134, 4, 957, 29, 3, 1061, 8226, 1696, 11, 409, 9, 3, 55, 1, 1932, 20, 2487, 888, 545, 794, 327, 667, 1, 140, 224, 1932, 55, 20, 86, 606, 849, 382, 201, 1, 598, 49, 83, 1, 2, 772, 175, 233, 1, 6183, 570, 1932, 84, 100, 86, 691, 826, 11, 199, 13, 18, 4, 352, 1932, 10, 44, 108, 4, 220, 6461, 246, 2, 154, 88, 2253, 4, 140, 1257, 125, 11, 655, 15, 2, 6183, 4, 8, 447, 69, 125, 10, 3610, 109, 1932, 55, 192, 16, 4724, 17, 1932, 16, 746, 570, 4, 691, 134, 1, 3, 3629, 7553, 2, 9263, 84, 44, 527, 4, 140, 1, 1002, 2, 154, 88, 406, 192, 68, 40, 8, 952, 1, 1392, 29, 8, 154, 6, 8, 64, 88, 1180, 80, 140, 1, 6183, 594, 6, 40, 656, 6, 3764, 492, 46, 4800, 20, 8, 1932, 306, 308]",962.0,15328914,p16 expression squamous lesions female genital tract,0,0.0

Clinically identifying women with vulvar lichen sclerosus at increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma: a case-control study.,The Journal of reproductive medicine,J Reprod Med,2004-10-01,"To identify clinical factors that might identify women with vulvar lichen sclerosus who are at increased risk of developing squamous cell cacinoma. A retrospective, case-control study compared 46 women presenting between 1992 and 2000 with clinical and histologic evidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva arising in a background of lichen sclerosus and 213 new referrals with vulvar lichen sclerosus during the same period. The ages of the patients and presence of clinical hyperplasia were the only differences between the 2 groups.

Saphenous vein sparing during inguinal lymphadenectomy to reduce morbidity in patients with vulvar carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-12-20,"To compare short- and long-term morbidity associated with saphenous vein sparing versus ligation during inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar carcinoma. A retrospective evaluation of patients with carcinoma of the vulva that underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed. Operative reports were evaluated and patients were divided into those who had sparing of the saphenous vein versus ligation. Postoperative short- and long-term complications were compared between the two groups using Pearson chi squared analysis. There were a total of 49 inguinal lymphadenectomies performed on 29 patients. The saphenous vein was spared in 18 (37%) groin dissections compared to 31(63%) in which the saphenous vein was ligated. The two groups were similar in regards to clinical characteristics. All patients received closed suction drains and prophylactic antibiotics. Median number of nodes dissected was similar. Cellulitis was more common in the vein-ligated group compared to the vein-spared group (45% vs. 0%; P < 0.001). Wound breakdown occurred in 25% of dissections where the saphenous vein was ligated versus 0% in dissections where the vein was spared (P = or < 0.02). Short-term edema (< or = 6 months) was similar between vein-ligated and vein-spared groups (67% vs. 72%, P < 1.0). Subsequently, chronic lymphedema (> 6 months) persisted in 38% of the vein-ligated group compared to 11% in the vein-spared group (P < 0.05). The incidence of recurrent disease was similar in both groups (19.3 % vs. 22.2% P < 0.1). Routine preservation of the saphenous vein during inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar carcinoma may reduce the incidence of wound cellulitis, wound breakdown, and chronic lymphedema.",Journal Article,5145.0,52.0,compare short- long-term morbidity associated saphenous vein sparing versus ligation inguinal lymphadenectomy vulvar carcinoma retrospective evaluation patients carcinoma vulva underwent inguinal lymphadenectomy performed Operative reports evaluated patients divided sparing saphenous vein versus ligation Postoperative short- long-term complications compared groups Pearson chi squared total 49 inguinal lymphadenectomies performed 29 patients saphenous vein spared 18 37 groin dissections compared 31 63 saphenous vein ligated groups similar regards clinical characteristics patients received closed suction drains prophylactic antibiotics Median number nodes dissected similar Cellulitis common vein-ligated group compared vein-spared group 45 vs. 0 P 0.001 Wound breakdown occurred 25 dissections saphenous vein ligated versus 0 dissections vein spared P 0.02 Short-term edema 6 months similar vein-ligated vein-spared groups 67 vs. 72 P 1.0 Subsequently chronic lymphedema 6 months persisted 38 vein-ligated group compared 11 vein-spared group P 0.05 incidence recurrent disease similar groups 19.3 vs. 22.2 P 0.1 Routine preservation saphenous vein inguinal lymphadenectomy vulvar carcinoma reduce incidence wound cellulitis wound breakdown chronic lymphedema,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 932, 978, 2, 319, 337, 787, 41, 5, 24877, 2762, 1851, 185, 5307, 190, 4907, 2048, 9, 134, 8, 459, 451, 1, 7, 5, 134, 1, 3, 9263, 17, 208, 4907, 2048, 10, 173, 1208, 1198, 11, 194, 2, 7, 11, 2176, 237, 135, 54, 42, 1851, 1, 3, 24877, 2762, 185, 5307, 573, 978, 2, 319, 337, 521, 11, 72, 59, 3, 100, 271, 75, 4720, 3163, 8515, 65, 125, 11, 8, 181, 1, 739, 4907, 16322, 173, 23, 462, 7, 3, 24877, 2762, 10, 6830, 4, 203, 567, 9264, 6894, 72, 6, 456, 676, 4, 92, 3, 24877, 2762, 10, 18971, 3, 100, 271, 11, 288, 4, 8930, 6, 38, 374, 62, 7, 103, 3745, 20368, 14881, 2, 1862, 5214, 52, 207, 1, 502, 7973, 10, 288, 11168, 10, 80, 186, 4, 3, 2762, 18971, 87, 72, 6, 3, 2762, 6830, 87, 512, 105, 13, 19, 13, 144, 2689, 12498, 489, 4, 243, 1, 6894, 1257, 3, 24877, 2762, 10, 18971, 185, 13, 4, 6894, 1257, 3, 2762, 10, 6830, 19, 15, 13, 588, 978, 337, 3306, 15, 49, 53, 10, 288, 59, 2762, 18971, 2, 2762, 6830, 271, 598, 105, 720, 19, 14, 13, 1611, 442, 3063, 49, 53, 3760, 4, 519, 1, 3, 2762, 18971, 87, 72, 6, 175, 4, 3, 2762, 6830, 87, 19, 13, 474, 3, 287, 1, 387, 34, 10, 288, 4, 110, 271, 326, 27, 105, 350, 18, 19, 13, 14, 1311, 2224, 1, 3, 24877, 2762, 190, 4907, 2048, 9, 134, 68, 969, 3, 287, 1, 2689, 11168, 2689, 12498, 2, 442, 3063]",1618.0,16364412,Saphenous vein sparing inguinal lymphadenectomy reduce morbidity patients vulvar carcinoma,0,0.0
The outcomes of patients with positive margins after excision for intraepithelial Paget's disease of the vulva.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-10-24,"Vulvar Paget's disease is a rare neoplasm that usually occurs in postmenopausal women. Treatment with surgical excision can be complicated by extension of microscopic disease in an irregular manner well beyond the visible margins of the lesion. The objective or our study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with primary vulvar intraepithelial Paget's disease who had positive microscopic margins after primary excision. We reviewed the records of all patients with Paget's disease of the vulva treated at our institution from 1/80 to 9/02. Patients whose sample showed stromal invasion or an underlying carcinoma were excluded. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, disease location, treatment, surgical margin status, additional treatment, and clinical outcome. The medical records and histopathologic specimens of 28 women with intraepithelial Paget's disease of the vulva were evaluated. Surgical treatment consisted of radical vulvectomy in 3 patients (11%), simple vulvectomy in 18 patients (64%), and wide local excision in the other 7 patients (25%). Of the 20 patients with microscopically positive margins, 14 (70%) developed recurrent disease and the remaining 6 (30%) are disease free. Of the 8 patients with negative margins, 3 (38%) developed disease recurrence and the remaining 5 (63%) are disease free. With a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 3-186 months), there was no correlation between disease recurrence and margin status (P=0.20). Of the 17 patients who recurred, 14 (82%) underwent additional surgical excision and 1 patient was treated with Retin-A. The remaining 2 patients refused further treatment and were lost to follow-up. In those patients who underwent surgery for recurrence, between 1 and 3 re-excisions were performed. Of the 15 evaluable patients who were treated for recurrent disease, 12 (80%) had no evidence of persistent disease and 3 (20%) had persistent disease at a median follow-up of 63.7 months (range, 18.5-186 months). Microscopically positive margins following surgical excision of vulvar intraepithelial Paget's disease is a frequent finding, and disease recurrence is common regardless of surgical margin status.

Gynecologic Oncology Group risk groups for vulvar carcinoma: improvement in survival in the modern era.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-05-31,"Patients with vulvar cancer were stratified into risk groups for survival based on surgicopathologic findings from a prospective study conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group from 1977-1984. The purpose of this study is to reassess these risk groups in patients treated in an era of contemporary management. Patients with vulvar carcinoma were identified from 1990-2005 for retrospective analysis. Charts were abstracted for clinical, histopathologic and surgical data, and patients stratified into four risk groups for survival based on the clinical size of tumor and extent of lymph node metastasis. Univariate and multivariate characteristics were evaluated and 5-year survival determined by Kaplan-Meier method. 175 patients were identified that underwent surgical management with a median age at diagnosis of 59.9 years. Stage distribution included: I (n=89, 51%), II (n=53, 30%), III (n=29, 17%), and IV (n=4, 2%). Stratification into risk groups included: minimal (n=89, 51%), low (n=69, 40%), intermediate (n=11, 6%), and high (n=6; 3%). The survival rate was 100%, 97%, 82% and 100%, respectively, at median follow-up of 54.5 months. Comparatively, the survival rates for historic groups were 97.9%, 87.4%, 74.8% and 29.0%. Using multivariate analysis, age (p=0.04) and lymph node metastasis (p=0.009) were predictive of survival. Survival among the minimal and low risk groups is preserved in spite of less radical surgery. 5-year survival rate for intermediate and high risk patients also appears to be improved.

Comparison of outcome measures in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva treated with surgery or primary chemoradiation.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-12-26,"To review outcome measures including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and patterns of recurrence in patients with advanced vulvar cancer managed by primary surgery (PS) or primary chemoradiation (PCRT) as well as population characteristics for the two groups. Patients diagnosed with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva from 1990 to 2006 were identified for retrospective analysis at a single institution. Charts were abstracted for clinical and pathologic findings, treatment modalities, complications, recurrence, and follow-up. Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine PFS and OS. Sixty-three patients with stage III (n=47) and IV (n=16) carcinoma of the vulva were identified; 30 patients were treated with PS, and 33 patients had tumor that was unresectable by vulvectomy and underwent PCRT. Patients treated with PCRT were younger (61 vs. 72 years; p=0.09), had less metastasis to lymph nodes (54% vs. 83%, p=0.01), and larger tumors (6 vs. 3.5 cm, p=0.0001) compared to patients treated with PS. Despite these differences, OS for the PS and PCRT groups was 69% and 76% (NS), respectively, with median follow-up at 31 months. There were no differences in PFS or recurrence rates between the two groups. By multivariate analysis, age was the only significant predictor of OS or PFS. Patients with advanced vulvar cancer that are managed with PS tend to be older patients that have smaller lesions but positive lymph nodes, whereas patients requiring PCRT are younger and have larger volume disease but fewer lymph node metastases. Despite these differences, patients treated with PS and PCRT have no differences in OS, PFS, or recurrence rates.

Patients undergoing an inguinal lymphadenectomy during the management of vulvar malignancy were randomized to receive sutured closure (SC) vs VH fibrin sealant sprayed into the groin followed by sutured closure (FS). Leg measurements were taken preoperatively and during postoperative encounters when surgical outcomes were assessed. Grade 2 or 3 lymphedema was defined as circumferential measurement increases of 3-5 cm and >5 cm, respectively. 150 patients were enrolled. 137 patients were evaluable for lymphedema analysis with 67 and 70 patients in the SC arm and FS arm, respectively. The incidence of grade 2 and 3 lymphedema was 67%(45/67) in the SC arm, and 60% (42/70) FS arm (p=0.4779). The incidence of lymphedema was strongly associated with inguinal infection (p=0.0165). Lymphedema was not statistically increased in those who received adjuvant radiation. 139 patients remained evaluable for a descriptive analysis of their surgical complications. The overall incidence of complications was 61%(43/70) and 59% (41/69) for SC and FS arms, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in duration of drains, drain output or incidence of inguinal infections, wound breakdowns or seromas. There was an increased incidence of vulvar infections in the FS arm (23/69) vs (10/70) (p=0.0098). The utilization of a Blake drain was associated with an increase in vulvar (p=0.0157) and inguinal wound breakdown (p=0.0456).

The risk of squamous cell carcinoma in persistent vulvar ulcers.,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",Menopause,2011-10-01,"The standard evaluation for vulvar ulcers includes an office biopsy. There are limited data regarding the false-negative rate of a punch biopsy in detecting squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. This study reports on pathologic discrepancies between office biopsy and subsequent wide local excision for nonhealing vulvar ulcers. A retrospective review of the surgical records of 118 consecutive vulvar procedures was performed. Eleven women with persistent vulvar ulcers in the absence of a mass or pigmented lesion were identified. Patient demographics, physical examination, office evaluation, and surgical and pathology reports for these 11 women were reviewed. A persistent vulvar ulcer was the presenting complaint in 11 (13.8%) of 80 women with squamous cell disease. Most women were postmenopausal, with a median age of 72 years. Nine of the 11 women had an office biopsy performed before consultation with a gynecologic oncologist. Five (55%) of these specimens had benign findings on office biopsy but revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma after subsequent excision. Three of four women with prior diagnosis of lichen sclerosis had ulcers harboring invasive carcinoma. Vulvar ulceration may be the only presenting symptom in women with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma especially in postmenopausal women. Prompt office biopsy should remain part of the standard diagnostic evaluation; however, cancer should be suspected even with a negative biopsy result if ulcerations persist.

Patients with locally-advanced (T3 or T4 tumors not amenable to surgical resection via radical vulvectomy), previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were treated with radiation (1.8 Gy daily × 32 fractions=57.6 Gy) plus weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) followed by surgical resection of residual tumor (or biopsy to confirm complete clinical response). Management of the groin lymph nodes was standardized and was not a statistical endpoint. Primary endpoints were complete clinical and pathologic response rates of the primary vulvar tumor. A planned interim analysis indicated sufficient activity to reopen the study to a second stage of accrual. Among 58 evaluable patients, there were 40 (69%) who completed study treatment. Reasons for prematurely discontinuing treatment included: patient refusal (N=4), toxicity (N=9), death (N=2), other (N=3). There were 37 patients with a complete clinical response (37/58; 64%). Among these women there were 34 who underwent surgical biopsy and 29 (78%) who also had a complete pathological response.

Eligible women had squamous cell carcinoma, at least 1-mm invasion, and tumor size ≥ 2 cm and ≤ 6 cm. The primary tumor was limited to the vulva, and there were no groin lymph nodes that were clinically suggestive of cancer. All women underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy. Histologic ultra staging of the sentinel lymph node was prescribed. In all, 452 women underwent the planned procedures, and 418 had at least one sentinel lymph node identified. There were 132 node-positive women, including 11 (8.3%) with false-negative nodes. Twenty-three percent of the true-positive patients were detected by immunohistochemical analysis of the sentinel lymph node. The sensitivity was 91.7% (90% lower confidence bound, 86.7%) and the false-negative predictive value (1-negative predictive value) was 3.7% (90% upper confidence bound, 6.1%).

Racial disparities and changes in clinical characteristics and survival for vulvar cancer over time.,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2013-07-24,"The purpose of this study was to examine changes over time in survival for African-American (AA) and white women diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for 1973-2009 was used for this analysis. We evaluated racial differences in survival between AA and white women. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards survival methods were used to assess differences in survival by race by decade of diagnosis. The study sample included 5867 women, including 5379 whites (91.6%) and 488 AA (8.3%). AA women were younger (57 vs 67 years; P < .001) and had a higher rate of distant metastasis (6.1% vs 3.7%; P < .001). AA women had surgery less frequently (84.2% vs 87.6%; P = .03) and more frequently radiotherapy (24.2% vs 20.6%; P < .001). AA women had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.95) of all-cause mortality and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53-0.82) of vulvar cancer mortality compared with whites.

Paget Cells in Endometrial and Endocervical Curettings in a Patient With Recurrent Vulvar Paget's Disease.,International journal of surgical pathology,Int. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-08-05,"Paget's disease of the vulva is a rare malignancy primarily affecting Caucasian women in their seventh to eighth decades. Most patients experience an indolent disease course and undergo surgical excision for disease control. Although progression to invasive adenocarcinoma is rare, recurrence is common because of the difficulty of achieving negative surgical margins. We report a case of a 73-year-old woman with a long-standing history of recurrent vulvar Paget's disease who presented with postmenopausal bleeding. Workup revealed extensive endocervical involvement by Paget's disease, resulting in Paget cells on endocervical curettage, as well as endometrial curettage (because of cervical contamination). Extensive endocervical involvement by vulvar Paget's disease can occur despite multiple reexcisions and topical therapy. The presence of Paget cells on endometrial and endocervical curettings, particularly in patients without visible vulvar or cervical lesions, should raise suspicion of endocervical involvement and prompt further evaluation of disease extension.",Case Reports,2360.0,1.0,Paget 's disease vulva rare malignancy primarily affecting Caucasian women seventh eighth decades patients experience indolent disease course undergo surgical excision disease control progression invasive adenocarcinoma rare recurrence common difficulty achieving negative surgical margins report case 73-year-old woman long-standing history recurrent vulvar Paget 's disease presented postmenopausal bleeding Workup revealed extensive endocervical involvement Paget 's disease resulting Paget endocervical curettage endometrial curettage cervical contamination Extensive endocervical involvement vulvar Paget 's disease occur despite multiple reexcisions topical therapy presence Paget endometrial endocervical curettings particularly patients visible vulvar cervical lesions raise suspicion endocervical involvement prompt evaluation disease extension,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[7497, 292, 34, 1, 3, 9263, 16, 8, 622, 710, 1561, 2319, 3229, 117, 4, 136, 8114, 6, 7732, 1968, 96, 7, 730, 35, 2316, 34, 906, 2, 1251, 221, 1366, 9, 34, 182, 242, 91, 6, 416, 449, 16, 622, 146, 16, 186, 408, 1, 3, 4035, 1, 1785, 199, 221, 1012, 21, 414, 8, 473, 1, 8, 803, 111, 1095, 2854, 5, 8, 319, 10909, 532, 1, 387, 7497, 292, 34, 54, 917, 5, 1679, 2294, 4755, 553, 1344, 10174, 799, 20, 7497, 292, 34, 1113, 4, 7497, 37, 23, 10174, 12529, 22, 149, 22, 12529, 408, 1, 9866, 1344, 10174, 799, 20, 7497, 292, 34, 122, 1271, 550, 232, 34594, 2, 5879, 36, 3, 463, 1, 7497, 37, 23, 2, 10174, 63187, 823, 4, 7, 187, 4822, 15, 406, 257, 5008, 5782, 1, 10174, 799, 2, 4776, 195, 451, 1, 34, 2401]",1002.0,23918905,Paget Endometrial Endocervical Curettings Patient Recurrent Vulvar Paget 's Disease,4,0.07017543859649122
Outcomes in patients with mucosal melanomas.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2013-10-16,"Our goal was to evaluate the different subtypes of mucosal melanoma and describe specific variables that predict outcomes. Prospective review of two tertiary care center databases identified 76 mucosal melanoma patients; 73 with complete records were included. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Cox regression determined variables impacting recurrence and survival. In the 73 patients, the mean age was 64 years, and 74% were female. Sixty-seven percent presented with lymph node involvement, and 73% had ulcerated tumors. Major sites affected were nasal/palate/oral (36%), vulvar/vaginal/cervical (48%), and anorectal (15%). Mean overall and disease-free survival were 56.9 and 27.2 months. Variables associated with decreased survival included: lymphovascular invasion (HR17.70, P = 0.0093), Caucasian race (HR3.02, P = 0.0362), nasal/palate/oral sub-group (HR1.85, P = 0.026), Breslow thickness (HR1.23, P = 0.00004), T stage (HR1.34, P = 0.0075), M stage (HR3.03, P = 0.0039), and chemotherapy (HR3.13, P = 0.0002). The worst prognosis was seen in the nasal/palate/oral sub-group, with a median overall survival of 9.7 months and recurrence-free time of 4.5 months.

Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared. 161 patients were included (58 young, 62 in the middle, and 41 senior). Women in the young group predominately had a diagnosis of cervical cancer (82.8%) while women in the senior group primarily had a diagnosis of vulvar or vaginal cancer (70.7%). Senior women were also more likely to have hypertension (p < 0.0001) and pulmonary disease (p = 0.040).

Management of vulvar and vaginal melanomas: current and future strategies.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2014-01-01,"Melanomas arising in the vulva and vagina are rare and therefore there is minimal data specific to these malignancies. Data are often extrapolated from other cutaneous melanomas, which may or may not be appropriate. Surgery remains the primary treatment modality at initial diagnosis and in select recurrent cases. Wide local excision of the primary lesion not requiring an exenteration, along with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, should be routinely considered in vulvar melanomas. Local excision and SLN mapping is difficult and often not considered for vaginal melanomas. Primary exenterative procedures should not be routinely offered. In locally advanced cases potentially requiring an exenterative procedure, radiation therapy with or without concurrent immunotherapy is a consideration. The role of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Surgery or radiation therapy can be considered in recurrent cases. Systemic chemotherapy agents have a modest response rate with associated poor survival outcomes.

Overall survival after pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancy.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-07-09,"Five-Year survival after pelvic exenteration for gynecologic malignancies has been reported as high as 60%. The objective of this study was to determine overall survival (OS) after pelvic exenteration and evaluate factors impacting outcome. A retrospective review of all women who underwent pelvic exenteration at our institution between February 1993 and December 2010 was performed. OS was defined as time from exenteration to date of death or last contact. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan Meyer method. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the impact of clinical and pathologic factors on survival outcomes. One hundred sixty patients with gynecologic malignancy underwent pelvic exenteration. Five-year recurrence free survival (RFS) was 33% (95%CI 0.25-0.40). Factors which negatively impacted RFS included shorter treatment-free interval (p=.050), vulvar primary (p=.032), positive margins (p<.001), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI, p<.001), positive lymph nodes (p<.001) and perineural invasion (p=0.030). In multivariate analysis, positive margins (p=.040), positive nodes (p<.001) and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI, p=.003) retained a significant impact on RFS. Five-year OS was 40% (95% CI 0.32-0.48). Factors which negatively impacted OS included vulvar primary (p=.04), positive margins (p<.001), LVSI (p<.001), positive lymph nodes (p<.001) and perineural invasion (p=.008). In multivariate analysis, positive nodes (p=.001) and LVSI (p=.001) retained a significant impact on OS. Five-year OS after pelvic exenteration was 40%.

"Does intra-operative radiation at the time of pelvic exenteration improve survival for patients with recurrent, previously irradiated cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer?",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-07-30,"To determine whether intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT) at the time of pelvic exenteration (PE) or laterally extended endopelvic resection (LEER) improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated gynecologic cancers. We conducted a single institution retrospective review of patients who had undergone a complete PE for locally recurrent gynecologic cancer. Demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected. 32 patients were identified (2000-2012); 21 (66%) cervical cancer, 8 (25%) vaginal, and 3 (9%) vulvar cancer. All patients were previously irradiated. Twenty-one (66%) received IORT. Mean age was 51. Eight patients had a LEER, all with IORT. Median PFS and OS, respectively, for those with PE alone was 33 and 41 vs. 10 and 10 months for PE+IORT compared to 9 and 17 months for LEER+IORT (P=.04). Increasing tumor size negatively impacted PFS (hazard ratio 1.3; 95%CI 1.12-1.52). Margin status was not associated with survival. No patients undergoing LEER+IORT recurred only locally whereas 62% recurred with a distant component (+/- local). Patients with PE alone had mainly local (36%) and few (9%) distant recurrences compared to 31% local and 38% distant (+/- local) recurrences for those with PE+IORT. We failed to demonstrate that IORT changes survival and recurrence outcomes. However, patients with clinical indications for IORT at the time of PE have worse prognosis compared to those who do not require IORT. If the need for IORT is anticipated, the surgeon may consider performing a LEER to decrease local recurrence if cure is the goal or consider palliative treatment options.",Journal Article,2001.0,15.0,determine intra-operative radiation therapy IORT time pelvic exenteration PE laterally extended endopelvic resection LEER improves progression-free survival PFS patients recurrent previously irradiated gynecologic conducted single institution retrospective review patients undergone complete PE locally recurrent gynecologic Demographic clinicopathologic collected 32 patients identified 2000-2012 21 66 cervical 8 25 vaginal 3 9 vulvar patients previously irradiated Twenty-one 66 received IORT Mean age 51 patients LEER IORT Median PFS OS respectively PE 33 41 vs. 10 10 months PE+IORT compared 9 17 months LEER+IORT P=.04 Increasing size negatively impacted PFS hazard ratio 1.3 95 CI 1.12-1.52 Margin status associated survival patients undergoing LEER+IORT recurred locally 62 recurred distant component +/- local Patients PE mainly local 36 9 distant recurrences compared 31 local 38 distant +/- local recurrences PE+IORT failed demonstrate IORT changes survival recurrence outcomes patients clinical indications IORT time PE worse prognosis compared require IORT need IORT anticipated surgeon consider performing LEER decrease local recurrence cure goal consider palliative treatment options,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 223, 317, 2392, 1208, 121, 36, 4158, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1110, 5668, 4878, 15, 17800, 1747, 64703, 170, 32313, 1804, 91, 115, 25, 300, 4, 7, 5, 387, 373, 2398, 1512, 163, 21, 426, 8, 226, 731, 459, 206, 1, 7, 54, 42, 1989, 8, 236, 4878, 9, 795, 387, 1512, 12, 1540, 2, 1399, 74, 11, 786, 531, 7, 11, 108, 1081, 1195, 239, 700, 12, 66, 243, 2, 27, 83, 12, 62, 7, 11, 373, 2398, 737, 104, 700, 103, 4158, 313, 89, 10, 725, 659, 7, 42, 8, 32313, 62, 5, 4158, 52, 300, 2, 118, 106, 9, 135, 5, 4878, 279, 10, 466, 2, 605, 105, 79, 2, 79, 53, 9, 4878, 4158, 72, 6, 83, 2, 269, 53, 9, 32313, 4158, 19, 755, 602, 30, 444, 2723, 4619, 300, 360, 197, 14, 27, 48, 58, 14, 133, 14, 653, 959, 156, 10, 44, 41, 5, 25, 77, 7, 479, 32313, 4158, 3363, 158, 795, 547, 744, 3363, 5, 8, 626, 1249, 293, 7, 5, 4878, 279, 42, 2615, 293, 511, 2, 1021, 83, 626, 1593, 72, 6, 456, 293, 2, 519, 626, 293, 1593, 9, 135, 5, 4878, 4158, 21, 1551, 6, 608, 17, 4158, 400, 25, 2, 146, 123, 137, 7, 5, 38, 2406, 9, 4158, 28, 3, 98, 1, 4878, 47, 639, 356, 72, 6, 135, 54, 1022, 44, 1353, 4158, 492, 3, 594, 9, 4158, 16, 4078, 3, 1897, 68, 2419, 3620, 8, 32313, 6, 775, 293, 146, 492, 1722, 16, 3, 1326, 15, 2419, 994, 24, 838]",1560.0,25084510,intra-operative radiation time pelvic exenteration improve survival patients recurrent previously irradiated cervical vaginal vulvar,1,0.017543859649122806

The effect of groin treatment modality and sequence on clinically significant chronic lymphedema in patients with vulvar carcinoma.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2015-01-01,"Chronic lymphedema (CL) after inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) or radiotherapy (RT) is a significant problem for vulvar cancer survivors. The treatment modality or combination of therapies that poses the greatest risk is not known. The objective of this study was to describe rates of clinically significant CL conferred by different groin treatment modalities. Medical records of vulvar cancer patients who had groin treatment with ILND, RT, or both were retrospectively reviewed. Each treated groin was considered individually, and divided into 4 treatment groups: ILND alone, ILND with adjuvant RT, neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NCRT), or NCRT followed by ILND. Clinically significant CL was defined as that which required treatment and was recorded by laterality. Differences among groups were evaluated with χ(2) and Fisher exact test. Between 2000 and 2010, 146 patients with vulvar cancer who underwent therapy to 1 or both groins were identified for a total of 266 treated groins. The rates of CL for single-modality treatment, ILND or NCRT, were 10.9% and 6.7%, respectively. Multimodal treatment resulted in higher rates of CL, 13.5% for ILND followed by RT and 17.2% for NCRT followed by ILND, although differences were not significant (P = 0.37).

Survival outcomes for patients with stage IVB vulvar cancer with grossly positive pelvic lymph nodes: time to reconsider the FIGO staging system?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-12-16,"To evaluate treatment outcomes for patients with vulvar cancer with grossly positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs). From a database of 516 patients with vulvar cancer, we identified patients with grossly positive PLNs without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. We identified 20 patients with grossly positive PLNs; inclusion criteria included PLN 1.5cm or larger in short axis dimension on CT/MRI (n=11), FDG-avid PLN on PET/CT (n=3), or biopsy-proven PLN disease (n=6). Ten patients were treated with chemoradiation therapy (CRT), 4 with RT alone, and 6 with various combinations of surgery, RT or CRT. Median follow-up time for patients who had not died of cancer was 47months (range, 4-228months). Mean primary vulvar tumor size was 6.4cm; 12 patients presented with 2009 AJCC T2 and 8 with T3 disease. All patients had grossly positive inguinal nodes, and the mean inguinal nodal diameter was 2.8cm. The 5-year overall survival and disease specific survival rates were 43% and 48%, respectively. Eleven patients had recurrences, some at multiple sites. There were 9 recurrences in the vulva, but no isolated nodal recurrences. Four patients developed distant metastasis within 6months of starting radiation therapy. Aggressive locoregional treatment can lead to favorable outcomes for many patients with grossly involved PLNs that is comparable to that of grossly involved inguinal nodes only.

Update on sentinel lymph node biopsy for early-stage vulvar cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-05-27,"Two prospective, multicenter clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility and reproducibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy as part of the standard management of early-stage vulvar carcinoma. On the basis of the results of these trials, many gynecologic oncologists have incorporated SLN biopsy for vulvar cancer into their practice. Studies have further shown that SLN biopsy is associated with better quality of life than full lymphadenectomy, is more cost-effective than full lymphadenectomy, and improved pathologic evaluation. A large observational study is currently evaluating the outcomes of patients with early-stage vulvar cancer according to the results of their SLN biopsy and the approach to their care; this study may confirm that full inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is no longer necessary in most patients with this disease.

Survivors of gynecologic malignancies: impact of treatment on health and well-being.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2015-08-06,"While overall survival from gynecologic malignancies has greatly improved over the last three decades, required treatments can lead to multiple health issues for survivors. Our objective was to identify health concerns that gynecologic cancer survivors face. A systematic, stratified sample of women with gynecologic malignancies was surveyed for 18 health issues occurring before, during, or after treatment. The impact of clinical features and treatment modality on health issues was assessed through multivariate logistic regression models. Of 2,546 surveys mailed, 622 were not received by eligible subjects secondary to invalid address, incorrect diagnosis, or death. Thus, 1924 survivors potentially received surveys. Of the 1,029 surveys (53.5%) completed, median age was 59 years; diagnoses included 29% cervical, 26% endometrial, 26% ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube, 12.1% vulvar, and 5.4% vaginal cancers. The most frequently reported health issues included fatigue (60.6%), sleep disturbance (54.9%), urinary difficulties (50.9%), sexual dysfunction (48.4%), neurologic issues (45.4%), bowel complaints (42.0%), depression (41.3%), and memory problems (41.2%). These rankings were consistent with patients' self-reported rankings of ""highest impact"" personal issues. After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, multivariate analyses revealed that treatment modality impacted the odds of experiencing a given health issue. Our study demonstrates that gynecologic cancer survivors experience a high frequency of health conditions and highlights the association between treatment modality and specific health concerns.

Disparities in Vulvar Cancer Reported by the National Cancer Database: Influence of Sociodemographic Factors.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2015-10-01,"To assess whether there is an association of patient sociodemographic factors with stage at diagnosis, treatment, and overall survival in patients with vulvar cancer in the National Cancer Database. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with primary squamous vulvar carcinoma identified from the National Cancer Database (1998-2004). Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine risk factors associated with advanced-stage (stage III or IV) disease at diagnosis. Multivariable Cox regression models were performed to explore risk factors associated with 5-year all-cause mortality. Of 11,153 patients, 42.3% (n=4,713) were diagnosed with stage I disease, 24.6% (n=2,745) stage II, 22.9% (n=2,556) stage III, and 10.2% (n=1,139) stage IV. Advanced stage was significantly associated with older age, nonprivate insurance, and treatment at a lower case volume center (P<.01). Of note, roughly 30% of patients with advanced-stage disease did not receive radiation therapy. Within the advanced stages, age 60 years or older and insurance type were associated with decreased survival (P<.01). In stage III disease, only black race and treatment at a community hospital were associated with a lower risk of death (P<.01).

Role of Indocyanine Green in Sentinel Node Mapping in Gynecologic Cancer: Is Fluorescence Imaging the New Standard?,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,J Minim Invasive Gynecol,2015-10-28,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy has proven safe and feasible in a number of gynecologic cancers such as vulvar cancer, cervical cancer, and endometrial cancer. The proposed aim of lymphatic mapping and sentinel node identification is to decrease the associated morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy, particularly the rate of lymphedema, while also increasing the detection of small tumor deposits in the node. Different tracers have been shown to be useful, including technetium-99 and blue dye, with a detection reported in 66% to 86%. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of fluorescent dies such as indocyanine green (ICG).

Dying well: How equal is end of life care among gynecologic oncology patients?,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-12-17,"To identify disparities in utilization of end of life (EoL) resources by gynecologic oncology (GO) patients. This retrospective analysis of the medical records of GO patients treated 1/2007-12/2011 and deceased 1/2012-8/2014 evaluated patient demographics, disease characteristics, and utilization of EoL resources. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. Of 189 patients analyzed, 113 (60%) were white, 38 (20%) Hispanic, 31 (16%) black, and seven (4%) Asian. Ninety-five (48%) had ovarian cancer, 51 (26%) uterine, 47 (23%) cervical, seven (3%) vulvar/vaginal. In the last 30days of life (DoL), 18 (10%) had multiple hospital admissions, 10 (5%) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 30 (16%) multiple Emergency Room (ER) visits, 45 (24%) received aggressive medical care and eight (4%) received chemotherapy in the final 14 DoL. Furthermore, 54 (29%) had no Supportive Care referral and 29 (15%) no hospice referral. Only 46 (24%) had a Medical Power of Attorney (PoA) or Living Will (LW) on file. Non-white race was associated with increased odds of dying without hospice (OR 3.07; 95%CI [1.27, 2.46], p=0.013). However, non-white patients who enrolled in hospice did so earlier than white patients (42 v. 27days before death, p=0.054). Non-white patients were also significantly less likely to have PoA/LW documentation (24% v. 76%, p=0.009) even if enrolled in hospice (12% v. 31%, p=0.007).

Carcinoma of the Bartholin Gland: A Review of 33 Cases.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2016-05-01,"Primary carcinoma of the Bartholin gland is a rare malignancy that accounts for approximately 5% of vulvar carcinomas. The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of women with primary Bartholin gland carcinoma (BGC) with those with non-Bartholin gland-related vulvar carcinoma. A retrospective chart review of 429 patients with invasive vulvar carcinoma evaluated at a single institution between 1993 and 2011 was performed. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data, pathologic information, treatment type, and recurrence/outcome information. These variables were compared between patients with primary BGC and patients with non-Bartholin gland-related vulvar carcinoma. Thirty-three (7.7%) of the 429 patients with invasive vulvar carcinoma had primary carcinoma of the Bartholin gland. Twenty-nine patients (87.9%) had squamous cell histology and 4 patients (12.1%) had adenocarcinoma. When compared with non-Bartholin gland-related vulvar carcinoma, patients with primary BGC had a younger age at diagnosis (median, 57 vs 63 years; P = 0.045), had a higher rate of stage III/IV disease (60.6% vs 35.8%; P = 0.008), and were more likely to receive radiation therapy (78.8% vs 43.9%; P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to histologic subtype, lymphovascular space involvement, perineural invasion, positive margins, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival.

Genetic Basis for PD-L1 Expression in Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Cervix and Vulva.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2016-04-01,"Patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix or vulva have limited therapeutic options, and the potential for immunotherapy for this population has not been evaluated. Recent trials suggest that tumors with a genetic basis for PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) ligand expression are highly sensitive to therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1. To determine the genetic status of CD274 (encoding PD-L1 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 1]) and PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2 [programmed cell death 1 ligand 2]) in SCCs of the cervix and vulva and to correlate the findings with PD-L1 protein expression. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes targeting CD274, PDCD1LG2, and the centromeric portion of chromosome 9, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an antibody recognizing PD-L1 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens from 48 cervical SCCs and 23 vulvar SCCs. Tumors were categorized according to the genetic abnormality in CD274 and PDCD1LG2 (coamplification > cogain > polysomy > disomy) as detected by FISH, and evaluated on a semiquantitative scale (modified H score, the product of the percentage of tumor cells with positive staining and the maximum intensity of positive staining) for PD-L1 protein expression as detected by IHC. Overall, 71 samples of FFPE tissue from cases of cervical SCCs (n = 48) and vulvar SCCs (n = 23) were retrieved from the archives of Brigham and Women's Hospital and included in this study.

Consensus Recommendations for Radiation Therapy Contouring and Treatment of Vulvar Carcinoma.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2016-02-21,"The purpose of this study was to develop a radiation therapy (RT) contouring atlas and recommendations for women with postoperative and locally advanced vulvar carcinoma. An international committee of 35 expert gynecologic radiation oncologists completed a survey of the treatment of vulvar carcinoma. An initial set of recommendations for contouring was discussed and generated by consensus. Two cases, 1 locally advanced and 1 postoperative, were contoured by 14 physicians. Contours were compared and analyzed using an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE), and a 95% confidence interval contour was developed. The level of agreement among contours was assessed using a kappa statistic. STAPLE contours underwent full committee editing to generate the final atlas consensus contours. Analysis of the 14 contours showed substantial agreement, with kappa statistics of 0.69 and 0.64 for cases 1 and 2, respectively. There was high specificity for both cases (≥99%) and only moderate sensitivity of 71.3% and 64.9% for cases 1 and 2, respectively. Expert review and discussion generated consensus recommendations for contouring target volumes and treatment for postoperative and locally advanced vulvar cancer. These consensus recommendations for contouring and treatment of vulvar cancer identified areas of complexity and controversy.

Menopausal hormone therapy in cancer survivors: A narrative review of the literature.,Maturitas,Maturitas,2016-07-27,"Decision making regarding the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for the treatment of bothersome menopausal symptoms in a cancer survivor can be complex, and includes assessment of its impact on disease-free or overall survival. Estrogen receptors are present in several cancer types, but this does not always result in estrogen-mediated tumor proliferation and adverse cancer-related outcomes. Estrogen may even be protective against certain cancers. Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after diagnosis of some cancer types, but not others. We provide a narrative review of the medical literature regarding the risk of cancer recurrence and associated mortality with initiation of MHT after the diagnosis of breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, hematologic cancers, and melanoma. Menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for management of bothersome menopausal symptoms in women with some cancer types (e.g., colorectal and hematologic cancer, localized melanoma, and most cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers), while nonhormonal treatment options may be preferred for others (e.g., breast cancer). In women with other cancer types, recommendations are less straightforward, and the use of MHT must be individualized.

Tumor Thickness and Mitotic Rate Robustly Predict Melanoma-Specific Survival in Patients with Primary Vulvar Melanoma: A Retrospective Review of 100 Cases.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-11-18,"<b>Purpose:</b> Primary vulvar melanoma (PVM) is the second most common vulvar malignancy. Despite their distinct anatomic site and unique molecular-genetic alterations, PVMs are staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines for primary cutaneous melanomas (PCM). However, whether parameters derived for PCM also apply to PVM remain a critical yet largely unexplored clinical question. The objective of this study was to determine the parameters predictive of survival in PVM.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We retrospectively reviewed 100 patients with PVM and determined associations between clinical and histopathologic parameters and disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS).<b>Results:</b> Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated older age (>56 years), greater tumor thickness, higher dermal mitotic rate, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, microscopic satellitosis, and absence of precursor nevus associated with decreased OS. Furthermore, age, midline, and/or multifocal involvement, greater tumor thickness, higher dermal mitotic rate, ulceration, lack of regression, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and microscopic satellitosis associated with decreased DSS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated tumor thickness, dermal mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, microscopic satellitosis, and absence of precursor nevus independently predicted shorter OS. Only tumor thickness and increased dermal mitotic rate (≥2/mm<sup>2</sup>) independently predicted reduced DSS. In comparison with the AJCC T-category, a novel, bivariate T-category based only on tumor thickness and dermal mitotic rate robustly predicted OS and DSS in our patient cohort.<b>Conclusions:</b> In the largest single institutional study of PVM, we demonstrate a combination of tumor thickness and mitotic rate comprise a simple but robust T-category to direct staging and prognosis. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(8); 2093-104. ©2016 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,1159.0,11.0,b Purpose /b Primary vulvar melanoma PVM second common vulvar malignancy Despite distinct anatomic site unique molecular-genetic alterations PVMs staged according American Joint Committee AJCC guidelines primary cutaneous melanomas PCM parameters derived PCM apply PVM remain critical largely unexplored clinical question objective determine parameters predictive survival PVM. b Experimental Design /b retrospectively reviewed 100 patients PVM determined associations clinical histopathologic parameters disease-specific survival DSS overall survival OS b /b Univariate Cox regression demonstrated older age 56 years greater thickness higher dermal mitotic rate ulceration lymphovascular invasion perineural invasion microscopic satellitosis absence precursor nevus associated decreased OS Furthermore age midline and/or multifocal involvement greater thickness higher dermal mitotic rate ulceration lack regression lymphovascular invasion perineural invasion microscopic satellitosis associated decreased DSS Multivariate demonstrated thickness dermal mitotic rate lymphovascular invasion microscopic satellitosis absence precursor nevus independently predicted shorter OS thickness increased dermal mitotic rate ≥2/mm sup 2 /sup independently predicted reduced DSS comparison AJCC T-category novel bivariate T-category based thickness dermal mitotic rate robustly predicted OS DSS patient cohort. b Conclusions /b largest single institutional PVM demonstrate combination thickness mitotic rate comprise simple robust T-category direct staging prognosis Clin Res 23 8 2093-104 ©2016 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 86, 32675, 16, 3, 419, 96, 186, 710, 550, 136, 834, 2745, 606, 2, 991, 219, 336, 593, 69372, 32, 2930, 768, 6, 3, 597, 2093, 2002, 23, 12, 2271, 677, 9, 86, 1486, 1965, 12450, 137, 317, 1038, 526, 9, 12450, 120, 4930, 6, 32675, 918, 8, 740, 1145, 1733, 8398, 38, 2840, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 1038, 464, 1, 25, 4, 32675, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 21, 894, 446, 394, 7, 5, 32675, 2, 509, 685, 59, 38, 2, 2630, 1038, 2, 34, 112, 25, 1788, 2, 63, 25, 118, 132, 99, 132, 880, 418, 320, 65, 264, 434, 89, 664, 60, 378, 30, 2903, 142, 6132, 2346, 116, 5158, 2933, 578, 4917, 578, 2984, 23564, 2, 1127, 1, 2765, 8932, 41, 5, 340, 118, 798, 89, 8677, 2, 15, 3492, 799, 378, 30, 2903, 142, 6132, 2346, 116, 5158, 926, 1, 320, 2933, 578, 4917, 578, 2, 2984, 23564, 41, 5, 340, 1788, 331, 65, 264, 30, 2903, 6132, 2346, 116, 2933, 578, 2984, 23564, 2, 1127, 1, 2765, 8932, 1042, 783, 985, 118, 158, 30, 2903, 2, 101, 6132, 2346, 116, 3107, 321, 172, 18, 172, 1042, 783, 405, 1788, 4, 1155, 5, 3, 2271, 102, 2169, 8, 229, 7686, 102, 2169, 90, 158, 23, 30, 2903, 2, 6132, 2346, 116, 8547, 783, 118, 2, 1788, 4, 114, 69, 180, 132, 2130, 132, 4, 3, 2166, 226, 1115, 45, 1, 32675, 21, 608, 8, 150, 1, 30, 2903, 2, 2346, 116, 5238, 8, 2763, 84, 1922, 102, 2169, 6, 1196, 632, 2, 356, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 66, 41607, 3407, 3456, 1630, 70]",1906.0,27864417,Thickness Mitotic Rate Robustly Predict Melanoma-Specific Survival Patients Primary Vulvar Melanoma Retrospective Review 100 Cases,16,0.2807017543859649
Phase I trial of daily triapine in combination with cisplatin chemotherapy for advanced-stage malignancies.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.,2016-11-22,"Advanced-stage malignancies have increased deoxyribonucleotide demands in DNA replication and repair, making deoxyribonucleotide supply a potential exploitable target for therapy based on ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibition. A dose-finding phase I trial was conducted of intravenous (i.v.) triapine, a small-molecule RNR inhibitor, and cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced-stage solid tumor malignancies. Patients received dose-finding levels of i.v. triapine (48-96 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and i.v. cisplatin (20-75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on 1 of 3 different schedules. The primary endpoint was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of a triapine-cisplatin combination. Secondary endpoints included the rate of triapine-cisplatin objective response and the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of a single oral triapine dose. (Clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT00024323). The MTD was 96 mg/m<sup>2</sup> triapine daily days 1-4 and 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin split over day 2 and day 3. Frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events included fatigue, dyspnea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte abnormalities.

Challenges to delivery and effectiveness of adjuvant radiation therapy in elderly patients with node-positive vulvar cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-05-12,"To examine adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) use, patterns of RT delivery, and clinical outcomes in older patients with node-positive vulvar cancer. Using SEER-Medicare linked data, we identified 444 patients (age≥66years) with node-positive squamous cell vulvar carcinoma, without distant metastases, and treated with primary surgery between 1991 and 2009. We used claims to examine RT use and the following delivery metrics: 1) completion of ≥20 fractions, 2) treatment duration <8weeks, 3) <1week of intra-treatment break, and 4) treatment interval from surgery to start of RT <8weeks. We tested associations between RT use and metrics with overall (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) using multivariate proportional hazards regression. Median age was 78years (interquartile range [IQR]=74-83). Median follow-up was 17months (IQR=9-40). Three hundred six patients (69%) received RT. Three delivery metrics were associated with improved outcomes: completion of ≥20 fractions, treatment duration <8weeks, and <1week of intra-treatment break. Patients who achieved these 3 metrics demonstrated better disease outcomes compared with surgery alone (OS hazard ratio [HR] for death=0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.46-0.82, P=0.001; CSS HR=0.58, 95% CI=0.40-0.85,P=0.005).

Prospective screening with the validated Opioid Risk Tool demonstrates gynecologic oncology patients are at low risk for opioid misuse.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-08-12,"To characterize risk for opioid misuse among gynecologic oncology patients. The Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), a validated screen for opioid misuse risk, was administered to a convenience sample of patients with gynecologic cancer receiving opioid prescriptions in gynecologic oncology or palliative care clinics from January 2012-June 2016. Demographic and clinical information was abstracted on chart review. The primary outcome was ORT risk level (low vs. moderate or high). Chi-square tests were performed for categorical variables. A total of 118 women were screened. Most women were Caucasian (79%) with a median age of 57years. Ovarian cancer patients comprised 46% of the cohort with fewer endometrial (25%), cervical (23%), vulvar (4%), and vaginal (2%) cancer patients. The median ORT score was 1.0 (range, 0-10) out of a possible 26. Overall, 87% of patients were categorized as low-risk for opioid misuse, 7% as moderate-risk, and 6% as high-risk. Patients who were at moderate or high-risk of opioid misuse were significantly younger (47 vs. 58years, p=0.02), more likely to have cervical cancer (p=0.02), be smokers (p=0.01) and be uninsured or on Medicare (p=0.03).

Thirty-three patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 64 years. The median long-axis radiographic diameter of the largest inguinal lymph node or lymph node mass was 2.5 cm (range, 1.4-8.7). Sixteen patients (48%) also had evidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis. The median radiation dose delivered to grossly involved nodes was 66.0 Gy (range, 60.0-70.0). The 3-year actuarial incidences of vulvar, groin, and distant recurrences were 24.2%, 17.7%, and 30.3%, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 28 months (range, 2-196), four patients (12%) had groin recurrence, of whom three also had vulvar recurrence. There were few major late adverse effects of regional radiotherapy. The 3-year overall survival rate was 51%.

Racial and ethnic disparities over time in the treatment and mortality of women with gynecological malignancies.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-04-01,"To examine temporal trends in treatment and survival among black, Asian, Hispanic, and white women diagnosed with endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer. Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2014), we identified women diagnosed with endometrial, ovarian, cervical, and vulvar cancer. For each disease site, we analyzed race/ethnicity-specific trends in receipt of evidence-based practices. Professional societies' recommendations were used to define these practices. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (2000-2009) we analyzed trends in 5-year survival. Throughout the study period black (64.8%) and Hispanic (68.3%) women were less likely to undergo lymphadenectomy for stage I ovarian cancer compared to Asian (79.5%) and white patients (74.6%). Black women were the least likely group to undergo lymphadenectomy in all periods. Among patients with stage II-IV ovarian cancer, 76.6% of white and Asian women received both surgery and chemotherapy, compared to 70.8% of black and 73.9% Hispanic women. Hispanic women with deeply invasive or high-grade stage I endometrial cancer underwent lymphadenectomy less frequently (74.5%) than all other groups (80.7%). Black women were less likely to have chemo-radiotherapy for stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer (75.6% versus 80.4% of all others). Black women were also less likely to have a surgical lymph node evaluation for vulvar cancer (58.8% versus 63.5% of all others). Among women diagnosed with ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer, black women had lower five-year survival than other groups.

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study using national death certificate data from the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death Public Use Record Data. All women who died from gynecologic, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were identified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10 Revision, cause of death from 2003 to 2015. Regression analyses with ordinary least-squares linear probability modeling were used to test for differences in location of death over time, and differences in trends by cancer type, while controlling for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and education status. From 2003 to 2015, 2,133,056 women died from gynecologic, lung, breast, and colorectal malignancies in the United States. A total of 359,340 died from gynecologic malignancies, including ovarian cancer (n=188,366 [52.4%]), uterine cancer (n=106,454 [29.6%]), cervical cancer (n=52,320 [14.6%]), and vulvar cancer (n=12,200 [3.4%]). Overall, 49.2% (n=176,657) of gynecologic cancer deaths occurred at home or in hospice. The relative increase from 2003 to 2015 in the rate of deaths at home or in hospice was 47.2% for gynecologic cancer deaths (40.5% in 2003 to 59.5% in 2015). In adjusted analyses, the trend in the percentage of deaths at home or in hospice increased at a rate of 1.6 percentage points per year for gynecologic cancer deaths (95% CI 1.5-1.6) vs 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.5, P<.001), 1.4 (95% CI 1.4-1.5, P<.001), and 1.5 (95% CI 1.4-1.5, P=.09) percentage points per year for lung, breast, and colorectal cancer deaths, respectively. Between 2003 and 2015, there was a 47.2% increase (40.5-59.5%) in the rates of gynecologic cancer deaths occurring at home or in hospice.

The influence of surgeon volume on outcomes after pelvic exenteration for a gynecologic cancer.,Journal of gynecologic oncology,J Gynecol Oncol,2018-05-04,"To determine the effect of surgeon experience on intraoperative, postoperative and long-term outcomes among patients undergoing pelvic exenteration for gynecologic cancer. This was a retrospective analysis of all women who underwent exenteration for a gynecologic malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center, between January 1993 and June 2013. A logistic regression was used to model the relationship between surgeon experience (measured as the number of exenteration cases performed by the surgeon prior to a given exenteration) and operative outcomes and postoperative complications. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival outcomes. A total of 167 exenterations were performed by 19 surgeons for cervix (78, 46.7%), vaginal (43, 25.8%), uterine (24, 14.4%), vulvar (14, 8.4%) and other cancer (8, 4.7%). The most common procedure was total pelvic exenteration (69.4%), incontinent urinary diversion (63.5%) and vertical rectus abdominis musculocutaneous reconstruction (42.5%). Surgical experience was associated with decreased estimated blood loss (p<0.001), intraoperative transfusion (p=0.009) and a shorter length of stay (p=0.03). No difference was noted in the postoperative complication rate (p=0.12-0.95).

Impact of Sentinel Node Approach in Gynecologic Cancer on Training Needs.,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,J Minim Invasive Gynecol,2018-08-20,"We sought to estimate the impact of sentinel nodes in gynecologic oncology on fellowship training and discuss potential solutions. Retrospective multi-institution cohort (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Three tertiary cancer referral cancer centers. Patients with endometrial and vulvar cancer undergoing lymph node evaluation. Patient history and fellow case volumes were evaluated retrospectively for type of lymph node assessment. Minimally invasive endometrial cancer and vulvar cancer fellow case volumes in 3 large institutions were reviewed and average annual volumes calculated for each clinical gynecologic oncology fellow. For vulvar cancer, probabilities of sentinel lymph node mapping and laterality of lesions were estimated from the literature. For endometrial cancer, estimates of lymphadenectomy rates were determined using probabilities calculated from our historic database and from review of the literature. Modeling the approaches to lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer (full, selective, and sentinel), 100% versus 68% versus 24%, respectively, of patients would require complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and 100% versus 34% versus 12% would require para-aortic lymphadenectomy. In vulvar cancer, rates of inguinal femoral lymphadenectomy are expected to drop from 81% of unilateral groins to only 12% of groins. Sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial and vulvar cancer will play an increasing role in practice, and coincident with this will be a dramatic decrease in pelvic, para-aortic, and inguinal femoral lymphadenectomies. The declining numbers will require new strategies to maintain competency in our specialty.

Perineural invasion (PNI) in vulvar carcinoma: A review of 421 cases.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-11-03,"To evaluate the prevalence and associated prognostic indicators in patients with vulvar carcinoma with and without evidence of perineural invasion (PNI). A retrospective review identified 421 patients with invasive vulvar carcinoma evaluated at a single institution between 1993 and 2011. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data, pathologic information and presence or absence of PNI, treatment type, and recurrence/outcome information. Variables were compared between patients with PNI to those without PNI. Of the 421 patients included in the study, 32 (7.6%) had tumors with PNI. There were no significant differences in age, race/ethnicity, smoking history, histologic subtype, or grade between the group of patients with PNI and the group without PNI. The group with PNI was more likely to have lichen sclerosus (25.0% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.024), stage III/IV disease (59.4% vs. 36.0%, p = 0.007), lymph node involvement (50.0% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.002), and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (53.1% vs. 15.9%, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of patients in the PNI group underwent primary or adjuvant radiation therapy (68.8% vs. 45.0%, p = 0.016). The median follow-up was 67.1 months (range < 1.0 to 284.3). Patients with PNI had significantly shorter overall survival (OS), median 25.5 vs. 94.3 months (p < 0.001), and progression-free survival (PFS), median 17.5 vs. 29.0 months (p = 0.004). After adjusting for stage, patients with PNI had a greater risk for death and progression (OS: hazard ratio, 2.71; p < 0.001; PFS: hazard ratio, 1.64; p-value = 0.020).

Trends in Risks for Second Primary Cancers Associated With Index Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cancers.,JAMA network open,JAMA Netw Open,2018-09-07,"In the last 4 decades, survival among patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers has improved, while the incidence of these cancers has increased among younger cohorts. Among survivors of HPV-associated cancers, persistent HPV infection may remain a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers (HPV-SPCs). To investigate the risk of HPV-SPCs among survivors of HPV-associated index cancers and to test the hypothesis that the HPV-SPC risk among these persons has increased over the last 4 decades. A retrospective cohort study of 9 cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted to identify patients with HPV-associated (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile) cancers diagnosed from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2014. The dates of analysis were July 1, 2017, to January 31, 2018. The HPV-SPC risk was quantified by calculating standard incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10 000 person-years at risk (PYR). The HPV-SPC risk by time was estimated using Poisson regression. From 113 272 (73 085 female and 40 187 male) survivors of HPV-associated cancers, 1397 women and 1098 men developed HPV-SPCs. The SIRs for HPV-SPCs were 6.2 (95% CI, 5.9-6.6) among women and 15.8 (95% CI, 14.9-16.8) among men. The EARs were 18.2 per 10 000 PYR for women and 53.5 per 10 000 PYR for men. Among both women and men, those who had index oropharyngeal cancers had the highest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 19.8 [95% CI, 18.4-21.4] and EAR, 80.6 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 18.0 [95% CI, 16.9-19.1] and EAR, 61.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Women who had index cervical cancers and men who had index anal cancers had the lowest HPV-SPC risk (SIR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.2-2.7] and EAR, 4.5 per 10 000 PYR among women; SIR, 6.5 [95% CI, 4.7-8.8] and EAR, 18.5 per 10 000 PYR among men). Both women and men who had index HPV-associated cancers of any kind had a significantly higher risk of oropharyngeal HPV-SPCs. Over the last 4 decades, the risk of developing most types of HPV-SPCs after index cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers increased. According to this study, the HPV-SPC risk among survivors of HPV-associated cancers is significant, implying that persistent HPV infection at multiple sites may be associated with HPV-SPCs.

Prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia among women with high-grade lower genital tract dysplasia or cancer: Results of a pilot study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-03-01,"To estimate the prevalence of high-grade anal dysplasia in women with high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma of the cervix, vagina or vulva. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent anal cytology, anal HPV testing with Cervista HPV16/18 and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). Patients with HSIL (high-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion) or greater on anal cytology or anal biopsy were referred to a colorectal surgery specialist for further evaluation. Seventy-five women were enrolled in the study, including 47 with cervical (cervix group), 10 with vaginal (vagina group), 15 with vulvar (vulva group), 1 with cervical and vaginal, and 2 with vulvar and vaginal disease. The median age in the cervix group (40 years (range 26-69)) was substantially younger than in the vagina (60 years (38-69)) and the vulva (59 years (36-75)) groups. Anal HSIL based on composite endpoints of the most severe cytology or histology result was diagnosed in 6 patients (8.0%). Anal cytology revealed HSIL in 2 (2.7%), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) in 12 (16.0%), low-grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in 2 (2.7%), and was normal in 59 (78.7%) patients. Anal HPV16/18 test was positive in 15 (20.0%), negative in 48 (64.0%) and insufficient in 12 (16.0%) patients. Of the 6 women with high-grade anal dysplasia, three (50%) had a positive anal HPV16/18 test. No case of anal cancer was observed. Our results suggest that the prevalence of anal HSIL is elevated among women with HPV-related lower genital tract dysplasia or cancer.

"Cervical, Vaginal, and Vulvar Cancer Costs Incurred by the Medicaid Program in Publicly Insured Patients in Texas.",Journal of lower genital tract disease,J Low Genit Tract Dis,2019-04-01,"To determine from the perspective of the State of Texas, the direct medical care costs associated with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers in Texas Medicaid enrollees. We conducted a case-control study and searched Texas Medicaid databases between 2008 and 2012 for eligible cancer patients. A comparison group was selected for each cancer site using a 2-step 1:1 propensity score matching method. Patients were followed for 2 years after cancer diagnosis to estimate monthly and yearly direct medical costs. For each cancer site, the differential cost between patients and the matched comparison individuals was the estimated cost associated with cancer. The study included 583 cervical, 62 vaginal, and 137 vulvar cancer patients and equal numbers of cancer-free comparison individuals. Among the cases, 322 cervical cancer patients, 46 vaginal cancer patients, and 102 vulvar cancer patients were Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible enrollees. For Medicaid-only enrollees, the adjusted first- and second-year mean total differential costs were US $19,859 and $3,110 for cervical cancer, US $19,627 and $4,582 for vaginal cancer, and US $7,631 and $777 for vulvar cancer patients, respectively. For Medicaid-Medicare dual eligible enrollees, adjusted first- and second-year mean total differential costs incurred by Medicaid were US $2,565 and $792 for cervical cancer, US $1,293 and $181 for vaginal cancer, and US $1,774 and $1,049 for vulvar cancer patients, respectively.

Constitutively active ESR1 mutations in gynecologic malignancies and clinical response to estrogen-receptor directed therapies.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-04-13,"Endocrine therapy is often considered as a treatment for hormone-responsive gynecologic malignancies. In breast cancer, activating mutations in the estrogen receptor (mutESR1) contribute to therapeutic resistance to endocrine therapy, especially aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and clinical relevance of ESR1 genomic alterations in gynecologic malignancies. DNA from FFPE tumor tissue obtained during routine clinical care for 9645 gynecologic malignancies (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, vagina, vulvar, and placenta) was analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (base substitutions (muts), insertions, deletions, rearrangements, and amplifications) in ESR1 by hybrid capture next generation sequencing. A subset of alterations was characterized in laboratory-based transcription assays for response to endocrine therapies. A total of 295 ESR1 genomic alterations were identified in 285 (3.0%) cases. mutESR1 were present in 86 (0.9%) cases and were more common in uterine compared to other cancers (2.0% vs <1%, respectively p < 0.001). mutESR1 were enriched in carcinomas with endometrioid versus serous histology (4.4% vs 0.2% respectively, p < 0.0001 in uterine and 3.5% vs 0.3% respectively, p = 0.0004 in ovarian carcinomas).

GOG 244 - The LymphEdema and Gynecologic cancer (LEG) study: The association between the gynecologic cancer lymphedema questionnaire (GCLQ) and lymphedema of the lower extremity (LLE).,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-10-31,"To explore whether patient-reported lymphedema-related symptoms, as measured by the Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire (GCLQ), are associated with a patient-reported diagnosis of lymphedema of the lower extremity (LLE) and limb volume change (LVC) in patients who have undergone radical surgery, including lymphadenectomy, for endometrial, cervical, or vulvar cancer on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study 244. Patients completed the baseline and at least one post-surgery GCLQ and LVC assessment. The 20-item GCLQ measures seven symptom clusters-aching, heaviness, infection-related, numbness, physical functioning, general swelling, and limb swelling. LLE was defined as a patient self-reported LLE diagnosis on the GCLQ. LVC was measured by volume calculations based on circumferential measurements. A linear mixed model was fitted for change in symptom cluster scores and GCLQ total score and adjusted for disease sites and assessment time. Of 987 eligible patients, 894 were evaluable (endometrial, 719; cervical, 136; vulvar, 39). Of these, 14% reported an LLE diagnosis (endometrial, 11%; cervical, 18%; vulvar, 38%). Significantly more patients diagnosed versus not diagnosed with LLE reported ≥4-point increase from baseline on the GCLQ total score (p < 0.001). Changes from baseline were significantly larger on all GCLQ symptom cluster scores in patients with LLE compared to those without LLE. An LVC increment of >10% was significantly associated with reported general swelling (p < 0.001), heaviness (p = 0.005), infection-related symptoms (p = 0.002), and physical function (p = 0.006). Patient-reported symptoms, as measured by the GCLQ, discerned those with and without a patient-reported LLE diagnosis and demonstrated predictive value. The GCLQ combined with LVC may enhance our ability to identify LLE.",Journal Article,82.0,0.0,explore patient-reported lymphedema-related symptoms measured Gynecologic Lymphedema Questionnaire GCLQ associated patient-reported diagnosis lymphedema lower extremity LLE limb volume change LVC patients undergone radical surgery including lymphadenectomy endometrial cervical vulvar Gynecologic Oncology Group GOG 244 Patients completed baseline post-surgery GCLQ LVC assessment 20-item GCLQ measures seven symptom clusters-aching heaviness infection-related numbness physical functioning general swelling limb swelling LLE defined patient self-reported LLE diagnosis GCLQ LVC measured volume calculations based circumferential measurements linear mixed model fitted change symptom cluster scores GCLQ total score adjusted disease sites assessment time 987 eligible patients 894 evaluable endometrial 719 cervical 136 vulvar 39 14 reported LLE diagnosis endometrial 11 cervical 18 vulvar 38 Significantly patients diagnosed versus diagnosed LLE reported ≥4-point increase baseline GCLQ total score p 0.001 Changes baseline significantly larger GCLQ symptom cluster scores patients LLE compared LLE LVC increment 10 significantly associated reported general swelling p 0.001 heaviness p 0.005 infection-related symptoms p 0.002 physical function p 0.006 Patient-reported symptoms measured GCLQ discerned patient-reported LLE diagnosis demonstrated predictive value GCLQ combined LVC enhance ability identify LLE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"[6, 1645, 317, 69, 210, 3063, 139, 507, 22, 644, 20, 3, 1512, 12, 3063, 1770, 24352, 32, 41, 5, 8, 69, 210, 147, 1, 3063, 1, 3, 280, 2678, 24353, 2, 3930, 433, 707, 15022, 4, 7, 54, 47, 1989, 711, 152, 141, 2048, 9, 15, 12, 23, 1512, 413, 87, 4760, 45, 6567, 7, 781, 3, 330, 2, 28, 506, 104, 539, 152, 24352, 2, 15022, 455, 3, 179, 3471, 24352, 1018, 648, 934, 3780, 36769, 22328, 930, 139, 8655, 900, 2702, 1083, 6967, 2, 3930, 6967, 24353, 10, 395, 22, 8, 69, 1074, 210, 24353, 147, 23, 3, 24352, 15022, 10, 644, 20, 433, 8229, 90, 23, 7937, 1685, 8, 1646, 1739, 202, 10, 7315, 9, 707, 4, 934, 3132, 703, 2, 24352, 181, 368, 2, 586, 9, 34, 633, 2, 455, 98, 1, 16906, 625, 7, 13341, 11, 859, 16012, 4829, 587, 1, 46, 213, 210, 35, 24353, 147, 175, 203, 519, 97, 80, 7, 265, 185, 44, 265, 5, 24353, 210, 5915, 741, 344, 29, 330, 23, 3, 24352, 181, 368, 19, 13, 144, 400, 29, 330, 11, 97, 1077, 23, 62, 24352, 934, 3132, 703, 4, 7, 5, 24353, 72, 6, 135, 187, 24353, 35, 15022, 9705, 1, 79, 10, 97, 41, 5, 210, 1083, 6967, 19, 13, 144, 22328, 19, 13, 1614, 930, 139, 507, 19, 13, 1111, 2, 900, 343, 19, 13, 1861, 69, 210, 507, 22, 644, 20, 3, 24352, 19767, 135, 5, 2, 187, 8, 69, 210, 24353, 147, 2, 264, 464, 549, 3, 24352, 397, 5, 15022, 68, 1304, 114, 801, 6, 255, 24353]",1670.0,31679787,GOG 244 LymphEdema Gynecologic LEG association gynecologic lymphedema questionnaire GCLQ lymphedema lower extremity LLE,0,0.0
