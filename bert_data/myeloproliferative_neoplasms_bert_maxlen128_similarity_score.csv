Prognostic factors and scoring systems in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: a retrospective analysis of 213 patients.,Blood,Blood,2002-02-01,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by wide heterogeneity of clinical presentation and course. CMML shares myelodysplastic characteristics with features of myeloproliferative disorders. No treatment has proven effective in modifying the natural course of the disease. To improve the prognostic assessment of clinical outcome, the associations of patient and disease characteristics with survival times of 213 patients with CMML was investigated retrospectively. Median survival was 12 months. Univariate analysis identified low hemoglobin level; low platelet count; high white blood cell, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts; presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, high percentage of marrow blasts, low percentage of marrow erythroid cells, abnormal cytogenetics, and high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta(2)-microglobulin as characteristics associated with shorter survival. Hemoglobin level below 120 g/L (12 g/dL), presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, absolute lymphocyte count above 2.5 x 10(9)/L, and marrow blasts 10% or more were independently associated with shorter survival by multivariate analysis and were used to generate a prognostic score. The model identified 4 subgroups of patients with median survival of 24, 15, 8, and 5 months for low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high risk, respectively. Researchers could not confer objective evidence suggesting that arbitrary divisions of CMML by white blood cell counts into ""dysplastic"" and ""proliferative"" categories reflect clinical entities differing in the risk of acute leukemia development, although a trend of shorter survival in patients with leukocytosis was observed. The prognostic model was compared with 6 previously published scoring systems for myelodysplastic syndrome/CMML.

Study participants were patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). Troxacitabine was provided as an intravenous infusion for more than 30 minutes daily for 5 days at a dose of 8.0 mg/m(2)/d (40 mg/m(2) per course). Courses were given every 3 to 4 weeks according to antileukemic efficacy. Forty-two patients (AML, 18 patients; MDS, one patient; ALL, six patients; CML-BP, 17 patients) were treated. Median age was 51 years (range, 23 to 80 years); 22 patients were male. Stomatitis was the most significant adverse event, with three patients (7%) and two patients (5%), respectively, experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Ten patients (24%) had grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, and two patients (5%) had grade 3 skin rash. One patient (2%) had grade 3 fatigue and anorexia.

Genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1/RUNX1 and ETO cluster with topoisomerase II DNA cleavage and DNase I hypersensitive sites in t(8;21) leukemia.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2002-02-26,"The translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) is one of the most frequent chromosome translocations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML1/RUNX1 at 21q22 is involved in t(8;21), t(3;21), and t(16;21) in de novo and therapy-related AML and myelodysplastic syndrome as well as in t(12;21) in childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO (at 8q22) cluster in a few introns, the mechanisms of DNA recombination resulting in t(8;21) are unknown. The correlation of specific chromatin structural elements, i.e., topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and scaffold-associated regions, which have been implicated in chromosome recombination with genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO in t(8;21) is unknown. The breakpoints in AML1 and ETO were clustered in the Kasumi 1 cell line and in 31 leukemia patients with t(8;21); all except one had de novo AML. Sequencing of the breakpoint junctions revealed no common DNA motif; however, deletions, duplications, microhomologies, and nontemplate DNA were found. Ten in vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites were mapped in AML1, including three in intron 5 and seven in intron 7a, and two were in intron 1b of ETO.

21q22 balanced chromosome aberrations in therapy-related hematopoietic disorders: report from an international workshop.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2002-04-01,"The International Workshop on the relationship between prior therapy and balanced chromosome aberrations in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) and therapy-related acute leukemia (t-AL) identified 79 of 511 (15.5%) patients with balanced 21q22 translocations. Patients were treated for their primary disease, including solid tumors (56%), hematologic malignancy (43%), and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (single case), by radiation therapy (5 patients), chemotherapy (36 patients), or combined-modality therapy (38 patients). 21q translocations involved common partner chromosomes in 81% of cases: t(8;21) (n = 44; 56%), t(3;21) (n = 16; 20%), and t(16;21) (n = 4; 5%). Translocations involving 15 other partner chromosomes were also documented with involvement of AML1(CBFA2/RUNX1), identifying a total of 23 different 21q22/AML1 translocations. The data analysis was carried out on the basis of five subsets of 21q22 cases, that is, t(8;21) with and without additional aberrations, t(3;21), t(16;21), and other 21q22 translocations. Dysplastic features were present in all 21q22 cases. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) at presentation was highest in t(8;21) (82%) and lowest in t(3;21) (37.5%) patients. Cumulative drug dose exposure scores for alkylating agents (AAs) and topoisomerase II inhibitors indicated that t(3;21) patients received the most intensive therapy among the five 21q22 subsets, and the median AA score for patients with secondary chromosome 7 aberrations was double the AA score for the entire 21q22 group. All five patients who received only radiation therapy had t(8;21) t-AML. The median latency and overall survival (OS) for 21q22 patients were 39 and 14 months (mo), compared to 26 and 8 mo for 11q23 patients, 22 and 28 mo for inv(16), 69 and 7 mo for Rare recurring aberrations, and 59 and 7 mo for Unique (nonrecurring) balanced aberration (latency P < or = 0.016 for all pairwise comparisons; OS, P < or = 0.018 for all pairwise comparisons). The percentages of 21q22 patients surviving 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years were 58%, 33%, and 18%, respectively. Noticeable differences were observed in median OS between 21q22 patients (n = 7) receiving transplant (BMT) (31 mo) compared to 21q22 patients who received intensive non-BMT therapy (n = 46) (17 mo); however, this was nonsignificant because of the small sample size (log-rank, P = 0.33). t-MDS/t-AML with balanced 21q22 aberrations was associated with prior exposure to radiation, epipodophyllotoxins, and anthracyclines, dysplastic morphologic features, multiple partner chromosomes, and longer latency periods when compared to 11q23 and inv(16) t-MDS/AML Workshop subgroups. In general, patients could be divided into two prognostic risk groups, those with t(8;21) (median OS, 19 mo) and those without t(8;21) (median OS, 7 mo) leukemia (log-rank, P = 0.0007).",Congress,6504.0,76.0,International Workshop relationship prior therapy balanced chromosome aberrations therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes t-MDS therapy-related acute leukemia t-AL identified 79 511 15.5 patients balanced 21q22 translocations Patients treated primary disease including solid 56 hematologic malignancy 43 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis single case radiation therapy 5 patients chemotherapy 36 patients combined-modality therapy 38 patients 21q translocations involved common partner chromosomes 81 cases 8 21 n 44 56 3 21 n 16 20 16 21 n 4 5 Translocations involving 15 partner chromosomes documented involvement AML1 CBFA2/RUNX1 identifying total 23 different 21q22/AML1 translocations carried basis subsets 21q22 cases 8 21 additional aberrations 3 21 16 21 21q22 translocations Dysplastic features present 21q22 cases Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia t-AML presentation highest 8 21 82 lowest 3 21 37.5 patients Cumulative drug dose exposure scores alkylating agents AAs topoisomerase II inhibitors indicated 3 21 patients received intensive therapy 21q22 subsets median AA score patients secondary chromosome 7 aberrations double AA score entire 21q22 group patients received radiation therapy 8 21 t-AML median latency overall survival OS 21q22 patients 39 14 months mo compared 26 8 mo 11q23 patients 22 28 mo inv 16 69 7 mo Rare recurring aberrations 59 7 mo Unique nonrecurring balanced aberration latency P 0.016 pairwise comparisons OS P 0.018 pairwise comparisons percentages 21q22 patients surviving 1 year 2 years 5 years 58 33 18 respectively Noticeable differences observed median OS 21q22 patients n 7 receiving transplant BMT 31 mo compared 21q22 patients received intensive non-BMT therapy n 46 17 mo nonsignificant small size log-rank P 0.33 t-MDS/t-AML balanced 21q22 aberrations associated prior exposure radiation epipodophyllotoxins anthracyclines dysplastic morphologic features multiple partner chromosomes longer latency periods compared 11q23 inv 16 t-MDS/AML Workshop subgroups general patients divided prognostic risk groups 8 21 median OS 19 mo 8 21 median OS 7 mo leukemia log-rank P 0.0007,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 944, 4014, 23, 3, 858, 59, 324, 36, 2, 4115, 1170, 2152, 4, 36, 139, 2040, 102, 1223, 2, 36, 139, 286, 102, 2171, 108, 842, 1, 10532, 167, 33, 7, 5, 4115, 14402, 3262, 7, 11, 73, 9, 136, 86, 34, 141, 537, 57, 664, 813, 710, 601, 2, 7857, 12269, 8646, 226, 473, 20, 121, 36, 33, 7, 56, 511, 7, 15, 397, 1396, 36, 519, 7, 25998, 3262, 646, 186, 4852, 3560, 4, 865, 1, 140, 102, 66, 239, 78, 584, 664, 102, 27, 239, 78, 245, 179, 2, 102, 245, 239, 78, 39, 33, 3262, 1267, 167, 127, 4852, 3560, 11, 120, 1405, 5, 799, 1, 6535, 33205, 6092, 1386, 8, 181, 1, 382, 338, 14402, 6535, 3262, 3, 74, 65, 10, 2629, 1205, 23, 3, 877, 1, 365, 1890, 1, 14402, 140, 17, 16, 102, 66, 239, 5, 2, 187, 402, 2152, 102, 27, 239, 102, 245, 239, 2, 127, 14402, 3262, 6461, 404, 11, 364, 4, 62, 14402, 140, 36, 139, 286, 533, 102, 329, 28, 1031, 10, 1076, 4, 102, 66, 239, 878, 2, 2101, 4, 102, 27, 239, 567, 33, 7, 967, 234, 61, 645, 703, 9, 3410, 183, 7632, 2, 3999, 215, 222, 1103, 17, 102, 27, 239, 7, 103, 3, 96, 1686, 36, 107, 3, 365, 14402, 1890, 2, 3, 52, 1519, 368, 9, 7, 5, 568, 1170, 67, 2152, 10, 1627, 3, 1519, 368, 9, 3, 1797, 14402, 87, 62, 365, 7, 54, 103, 158, 121, 36, 42, 102, 66, 239, 102, 329, 3, 52, 5301, 2, 63, 25, 118, 9, 14402, 7, 11, 587, 2, 213, 53, 2035, 72, 6, 432, 2, 66, 2035, 9, 7975, 7, 350, 2, 339, 2035, 9, 6397, 245, 790, 2, 67, 2035, 9, 622, 6385, 2152, 2, 728, 2, 67, 2035, 9, 991, 37071, 4115, 7794, 5301, 19, 15, 13, 3820, 9, 62, 8716, 2213, 118, 19, 15, 13, 4047, 9, 62, 8716, 2213, 3, 5504, 1, 14402, 7, 3050, 14, 111, 18, 60, 2, 33, 60, 11, 717, 466, 2, 203, 106, 21011, 362, 11, 164, 4, 52, 118, 59, 14402, 7, 78, 67, 357, 941, 4611, 456, 2035, 72, 6, 14402, 7, 54, 103, 1686, 220, 4611, 36, 78, 641, 269, 2035, 137, 26, 10, 5542, 408, 1, 3, 302, 1000, 444, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 466, 102, 1223, 102, 329, 5, 4115, 14402, 2152, 10, 41, 5, 324, 645, 6, 121, 25999, 2, 3597, 6461, 2815, 404, 232, 4852, 3560, 2, 589, 5301, 3338, 198, 72, 6, 7975, 2, 6397, 245, 102, 1223, 329, 4014, 1453, 4, 1083, 7, 359, 40, 2176, 237, 100, 177, 43, 271, 135, 5, 102, 66, 239, 52, 118, 326, 2035, 2, 135, 187, 102, 66, 239, 52, 118, 67, 2035, 1066, 1026, 19, 13, 6626]",2668.0,11921272,21q22 balanced chromosome aberrations therapy-related hematopoietic disorders report international workshop,22,0.038394415357766144
Balanced chromosome abnormalities inv(16) and t(15;17) in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia: report from an international workshop.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2002-04-01,"The Workshop identified 48 unselected patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) and inv(16), and 41 patients with t(15;17) after chemotherapy (CT) and/or radiotherapy (RT) for a malignant or nonmalignant disease. The primary diseases were: breast cancer, 33 patients; lymphomas, 24 patients; various other solid tumors, 30 patients; and nonmalignant diseases, 2 patients. The general type of previous therapy was RT only in 10 patients with an inv(16) and in 12 patients with a t(15;17), alkylating agents plus topoisomerase II inhibitors in 24 patients with an inv(16) and in 18 patients with a t(15;17), topoisomerase II inhibitors only in 5 patients with an inv(16) and in 2 patients with a t(15;17), alkylating agents only in 6 patients in each subgroup, and other types of chemotherapy in 3 patients in each subgroup. Most CT-treated patients (69%) also received RT. The latency period to development of t-MDS/t-AML was short: a median of 22 months in patients with inv(16) and 29 months in patients with t(15;17). Twenty-six patients (54%) with an inv(16) and 17 patients (41%) with a t(15;17) had additional cytogenetic abnormalities, which were unrelated to age and survival in both subgroups. Trisomy of chromosomes 8, 21, and 22 and del(7q) were the most frequent additional abnormalities in the inv(16) subgroup, whereas +8, -5, and del(16q) were most frequent in the t(15;17) subgroup. The disease was overt t-AML in 38/48 patients (79%) with an inv(16) and in 38/41 patients (93%) with a t(15;17). Thirty-three of 39 intensively treated patients (85%) with an inv(16) obtained a complete remission, whereas 24 of 35 intensively treated patients (69%) with a t(15;17) obtained a complete remission. The median overall survival of intensively treated patients was 29 months in both cytogenetic subgroups. In the inv(16) subgroup, patients younger than 55 years of age had a longer survival when compared with older patients (P = 0.006). The study supports the observation that t-MDS/t-AML with inv(16) and t(15;17) is often associated with prior therapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors; however, a notable finding was the high frequency of treatment with only radiotherapy, 29% of t(15;17) and 21% of inv(16).

Impact of prolonged infusions of the putative differentiating agent sodium phenylbutyrate on myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2002-04-01,"The aromatic fatty acid sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) promotes cytostasis and differentiation in a wide variety of tumor types; among several molecular activities, inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) may account for many of its pharmacodynamic effects. A Phase I study demonstrated promising preliminary evidence of clinical activity in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome; however, plasma concentrations achieved at the maximum tolerated dose were less than those targeted based on in vitro studies. Because prolonged exposure to suboptimal concentrations of PB in vitro led to pharmacodynamic changes similar to a more brief exposure to higher concentrations, a study of the feasibility of prolonged administration of sodium PB was performed. Selected patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with sodium PB as a continuous i.v. infusion via ambulatory infusion pump. Sequential cohorts were treated for 7 consecutive days out of 14 or with 21 consecutive days out of 28. Prolonged infusions were well tolerated; dose-limiting central nervous system toxicity developed in 1 of 23 patients treated. End-of-infusion plasma concentrations were maintained within a range sufficient to inhibit HDAC. Two patients on the 21/28 schedule developed hematological improvement.

Clin. Oncol.,2002-05-01,"Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have high mortality from bone marrow failure or transformation to acute leukemia. Supportive care is standard therapy. We previously reported that azacitidine (Aza C) was active in patients with high-risk MDS. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 191 patients with MDS to compare Aza C (75 mg/m(2)/d subcutaneously for 7 days every 28 days) with supportive care. MDS was defined by French-American-British criteria. New rigorous response criteria were applied. Both arms received transfusions and antibiotics as required. Patients in the supportive care arm whose disease worsened were permitted to cross over to Aza C. Responses occurred in 60% of patients on the Aza C arm (7% complete response, 16% partial response, 37% improved) compared with 5% (improved) receiving supportive care (P <.001). Median time to leukemic transformation or death was 21 months for Aza C versus 13 months for supportive care (P =.007). Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia occurred as the first event in 15% of patients on the Aza C arm and in 38% receiving supportive care (P =.001). Eliminating the confounding effect of early cross-over to Aza C, a landmark analysis after 6 months showed median survival of an additional 18 months for Aza C and 11 months for supportive care (P =.03). Quality-of-life assessment found significant major advantages in physical function, symptoms, and psychological state for patients initially randomized to Aza C. Aza C treatment results in significantly higher response rates, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared with supportive care.

Clin. Oncol.,2002-05-01,"The impact of azacytidine (Aza C) on the quality of life of 191 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was assessed in a phase III Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial (9221). One hundred ninety-one patients (mean age, 67.5 years; 69% male) were randomized to receive either Aza C (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneous for 7 days every 4 weeks) or supportive care, with supportive care patients crossing over to Aza C upon disease progression. Quality of life was assessed by centrally conducted telephone interviews at baseline and days 50, 106, and 182. Overall quality of life, psychological state, and social functioning were assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI). Patients on the Aza C arm experienced significantly greater improvement in fatigue (EORTC, P =.001), dyspnea (EORTC, P =.0014), physical functioning (EORTC, P =.0002), positive affect (MHI, P =.0077), and psychological distress (MHI, P =.015) over the course of the study period than those in the supportive care arm. Particularly striking were improvements in fatigue and psychological state (MHI) in patients treated with Aza C compared with those receiving supportive care for patients who remained on study through at least day 106, corresponding to four cycles of Aza C.

GO was given in doses of 9 mg/m(2) of body-surface area on days 1 and 8 or, therapeutically equivalently, on days 1 and 15, with or without interleukin 11 (IL-11; 15 microg/kg per day on days 3 to 28), with assignment to IL-11 treatment made randomly. Complete remission (CR) rates were 2 of 26 (8%) for GO without IL-11 and 9 of 25 (36%) for GO with IL-11. Regression analyses indicated that IL-11 was independently predictive of CR but not survival. We compared GO with or without IL-11 with idarubicin plus cytosine arabinoside (IA), as previously administered, in similar patients. The CR rate with IA was 15 of 31 (48%), and survival was superior with IA compared with GO with or without IL-11 (P =.03). Besides accounting for possible covariate effects on outcome, we also accounted for possible trial effects (TEs) arising because IA and GO with or without IL-11 were not arms of a randomized trial. Bayesian posterior probabilities that GO with or without IL-11 produced longer survival than IA, after accounting for covariates and TEs, were less than 0.01 in patients with abnormal cytogenetic findings (AC) and less than 0.15 in patients with normal cytogenetic findings (NC). Regarding CR, the analogous probabilities were less than 0.02 for GO without IL-11 (all cytogenetic groups), and for GO with IL-11, less than 0.25 for AC groups and about 0.50 for NC groups. TEs 2 to 5 times the magnitude of those previously observed would be needed to conclude that survival with GO with or without IL-11 is likely longer than with IA. Thus, there is little evidence to suggest that GO with or without IL-11 should be used instead of IA in older patients with newly diagnosed AML or myelodysplastic syndrome.",Clinical Trial,6443.0,119.0,investigated treatment gemtuzumab ozogamicin 51 patients aged 65 years older newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia AML refectory anemia RA excess blasts transformation RA excess blasts given doses 9 mg/m 2 body-surface area days 1 8 therapeutically equivalently days 1 15 interleukin 11 IL-11 15 microg/kg day days 3 28 assignment IL-11 treatment randomly Complete remission CR rates 2 26 8 IL-11 9 25 36 IL-11 Regression indicated IL-11 independently predictive CR survival compared IL-11 idarubicin plus cytosine arabinoside IA previously administered similar patients CR rate IA 15 31 48 survival superior IA compared IL-11 P =.03 accounting possible covariate effects outcome accounted possible trial effects TEs arising IA IL-11 arms randomized trial Bayesian posterior probabilities IL-11 produced longer survival IA accounting covariates TEs 0.01 patients abnormal cytogenetic findings AC 0.15 patients normal cytogenetic findings NC CR analogous probabilities 0.02 IL-11 cytogenetic groups IL-11 0.25 AC groups 0.50 NC groups TEs 2 5 times magnitude previously observed needed conclude survival IL-11 likely longer IA little evidence suggest IL-11 instead IA older patients newly diagnosed AML myelodysplastic syndrome,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 565, 24, 5, 7918, 5566, 3537, 4, 725, 7, 1032, 556, 60, 15, 434, 5, 732, 265, 286, 533, 329, 52935, 1545, 4631, 5, 2612, 1, 2438, 4, 1392, 15, 4631, 5, 2612, 2438, 3537, 10, 447, 4, 415, 1, 83, 81, 188, 18, 1, 642, 1255, 965, 23, 162, 14, 2, 66, 15, 4602, 27900, 23, 162, 14, 2, 167, 5, 15, 187, 1603, 175, 501, 175, 167, 2440, 503, 379, 218, 23, 162, 27, 6, 339, 5, 4392, 6, 501, 175, 24, 1229, 1108, 236, 734, 684, 151, 11, 18, 1, 432, 66, 9, 3537, 187, 501, 175, 2, 83, 1, 243, 511, 9, 3537, 5, 501, 175, 320, 318, 1103, 17, 501, 175, 10, 1042, 464, 1, 684, 84, 44, 25, 21, 72, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 5, 5684, 349, 6903, 11563, 3302, 22, 373, 468, 4, 288, 7, 3, 684, 116, 5, 3302, 10, 167, 1, 456, 576, 2, 25, 10, 1123, 5, 3302, 72, 5, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 19, 680, 7301, 3116, 9, 899, 6322, 176, 23, 228, 21, 120, 3688, 9, 899, 160, 176, 21037, 2635, 408, 3302, 2, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 11, 44, 1335, 1, 8, 384, 160, 5032, 3028, 3518, 17, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 1687, 589, 25, 76, 3302, 50, 3116, 9, 2489, 2, 21037, 11, 299, 76, 13, 355, 4, 7, 5, 1668, 1266, 272, 1948, 2, 299, 76, 13, 167, 4, 7, 5, 295, 1266, 272, 5480, 666, 684, 3, 8579, 3518, 11, 299, 76, 13, 588, 9, 3537, 187, 501, 175, 62, 1266, 271, 2, 9, 3537, 5, 501, 175, 299, 76, 13, 243, 9, 1948, 271, 2, 545, 13, 212, 9, 5480, 271, 21037, 18, 6, 33, 1072, 3, 3131, 1, 135, 373, 164, 688, 40, 575, 6, 2060, 17, 25, 5, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 16, 322, 589, 76, 5, 3302, 631, 125, 16, 1215, 241, 6, 309, 17, 3537, 5, 15, 187, 501, 175, 257, 40, 95, 3496, 1, 3302, 4, 434, 7, 5, 732, 265, 329, 15, 681]",1864.0,12036860,Gemtuzumab ozogamicin interleukin 11 patients 65 years age older untreated acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome comparison idarubicin plus continuous-infusion high-dose cytosine arabinoside,30,0.05235602094240838
Clinical relevance of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2 in acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2002-07-01,"We have previously reported that high levels of cellular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein correlated with short survival of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). As VEGF exerts its effects via two receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2, we evaluated the significance of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 protein levels in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and their relationship to VEGF protein levels. Western blot analysis and radioimmunoassay confirmed and quantified specific protein levels in bone marrow samples from 41 MDS and 66 AML previously untreated patients. VEGFR-1 levels were significantly higher in AML than in MDS (P = 0.0004), but no significant difference was found in the VEGFR-2 levels (P = 0.5). No significant correlation between VEGFRs levels and duration of survival was found. VEGF protein levels were significantly higher in MDS than in AML (P < 0.0001). A Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed increasing VEGF levels to significantly correlate with shorter survival of patients with MDS (P = 0.008), a finding similar to our previous report of the inverse relationship between VEGF levels and survival of AML patients. We found a significant correlation between VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels in both AML and MDS (P < 0.0000001 andP < 0.0002 respectively) but not between VEGF and VEGFR-1 levels. These data suggest that VEGF expression, rather than the expression of its receptors, is the determining factor in the biological behaviour of AML and MDS, and that VEGFRs are differentially expressed in AML and MDS.",Journal Article,6413.0,54.0,previously reported high levels cellular vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF correlated short survival patients acute myeloid leukaemia AML VEGF exerts effects receptors VEGF receptor 1 VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 evaluated significance VEGFR-1 VEGFR-2 levels AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS relationship VEGF levels Western blot radioimmunoassay confirmed quantified specific levels bone marrow 41 MDS 66 AML previously untreated patients VEGFR-1 levels significantly higher AML MDS P 0.0004 significant difference VEGFR-2 levels P 0.5 significant correlation VEGFRs levels duration survival VEGF levels significantly higher MDS AML P 0.0001 Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed increasing VEGF levels significantly correlate shorter survival patients MDS P 0.008 finding similar previous report inverse relationship VEGF levels survival AML patients significant correlation VEGF VEGFR-2 levels AML MDS P 0.0000001 andP 0.0002 respectively VEGF VEGFR-1 levels suggest VEGF expression expression receptors determining factor behaviour AML MDS VEGFRs differentially expressed AML MDS,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 47, 373, 210, 17, 64, 148, 1, 763, 756, 845, 129, 161, 618, 178, 438, 5, 978, 25, 1, 7, 5, 286, 533, 2001, 329, 22, 618, 5685, 211, 176, 847, 100, 1186, 618, 153, 14, 2134, 14, 2, 2134, 18, 21, 194, 3, 724, 1, 2134, 14, 2, 2134, 18, 178, 148, 4, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 2, 136, 858, 6, 618, 178, 148, 1521, 2639, 65, 2, 18157, 557, 2, 2790, 112, 178, 148, 4, 581, 347, 29, 605, 1223, 2, 700, 329, 373, 1278, 7, 2134, 14, 148, 11, 97, 142, 4, 329, 76, 4, 1223, 19, 13, 5295, 84, 77, 93, 523, 10, 204, 4, 3, 2134, 18, 148, 19, 13, 33, 77, 93, 816, 59, 15864, 148, 2, 654, 1, 25, 10, 204, 618, 178, 148, 11, 97, 142, 4, 1223, 76, 4, 329, 19, 13, 488, 8, 418, 831, 360, 320, 202, 224, 602, 618, 148, 6, 97, 1513, 5, 985, 25, 1, 7, 5, 1223, 19, 13, 2155, 8, 1567, 288, 6, 114, 698, 414, 1, 3, 2931, 858, 59, 618, 148, 2, 25, 1, 329, 7, 21, 204, 8, 93, 816, 59, 618, 2, 2134, 18, 148, 4, 110, 329, 2, 1223, 19, 13, 37214, 53001, 13, 3531, 106, 84, 44, 59, 618, 2, 2134, 14, 148, 46, 74, 309, 17, 618, 55, 1832, 76, 3, 55, 1, 211, 1186, 16, 3, 2196, 161, 4, 3, 1037, 8173, 1, 329, 2, 1223, 2, 17, 15864, 32, 2478, 570, 4, 329, 2, 1223]",1503.0,12100142,Clinical relevance vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 2 acute myeloid leukaemia myelodysplastic syndrome,6,0.010471204188481676
The myelodysplastic syndromes: analysis of prognostic factors and comparison of prognostic systems in 128 Chinese patients from a single institution.,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,Hematol. J.,2002-01-01,"Although retrospective analysis were frequently undertaken, and many prognostic systems for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been proposed worldwide, few such studies have been performed and the effectiveness of different scoring systems have not yet been verified in independent patient populations in China. The aim of this single center study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and compare the prognostic scoring systems in Chinese patients with MDS. One hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed as primary MDS in our Institution were studied retrospectively to identify significant prognostic factors and to assess the predictive value of 11 previously described prognostic systems, including French-American-British (FAB) classification, World Health Organization (WHO) classification, Mufti, Sanz, Morra, Aul, Oguma, Toyama, Morel and international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). The median age of the patients was 50 years (range 13-82). The 2- and 5-year survival rate of the patients were 55.22+/-4.90% and 26.09+/-6.36% respectively, with a median survival of 31 months (range 1-127 months). Fifty patients (39.1%) had progressed to acute leukemia (AL) with a median time of 8 months (range 1-43 months). Major independent variables indicated by multivariate analysis were the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blast cells and complex karyotype aberrations for survival (P=0.042 and 0.042, respectively) and only the percentage of BM blast cells for AL transformation (P=0.023). All the systems except Mufti scores successfully discriminated risk groups concerning both survival and AL evolution, especially in the high risk group, ranging from 10 to 20 months and from 4 to 7 months, respectively. The FAB and WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS possessed lower P value (P<0.0001) than that of the rest scoring systems. The patients in our study were younger than these of the Western population, whereas the survival and AL transformation ratio were comparable to these previous studies.

TNF-alpha targeted therapeutic approaches in patients with hematologic malignancies.,Expert review of anticancer therapy,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,2002-06-01,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a major effector and regulatory cytokine with a pleiotropic role in the pathogenesis of several immune-regulated diseases, including graft versus host disease (GVHD) and hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma (MM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Curative treatment for the above diseases are not currently available for most patients. Therapeutic approaches inactivating or blocking TNF-alpha are being evaluated in clinical trials. This review describes the development of the soluble TNF-alpha receptor (p75 TNF-R: Fc; etanercept) and other agents inactivating or blocking TNF-alpha in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies. The satisfactory safety profile of etanercept--as demonstrated in patients with autoimmune diseases--has been confirmed in patients with hematologic malignancies and GVHD.

In a leukemia Phase I study, we investigated the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics of DX-8951f in patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML or acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). DX-8951f was given as an i.v. infusion over 30 min daily for 5 or 7 days. The starting dose was 0.6 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days (3.0 mg/m(2)/course). Courses were given every 3-4 weeks according to toxicity and antileukemic efficacy. Twenty-five patients (AML, 21 patients; myelodysplastic syndrome, 1 patient; acute lymphocytic leukemia, 2 patients; CML-BP, 1 patient) were treated.

"Myelodysplastic syndrome is not merely ""preleukemia"".",Blood,Blood,2002-08-01,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disease characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. There are significant biologic and clinical differences between MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We studied a cohort of 802 patients, 279 (35%) with newly diagnosed MDS and 523 (65%) with newly diagnosed AML, and compared clinical and biologic characteristics of the 2 groups. Complete clinical and cytogenetic data were available on all patients, and a subgroup of patients was studied for apoptosis, angiogenesis, proliferation, and growth factors. Our results demonstrate that MDS is a discrete entity that is different from AML and is characterized primarily by increased apoptosis in early and mature hematopoietic cells. Using cell sorting and loss of heterozygosity, we demonstrate that the leukemic cells from MDS patients are capable of differentiation into mature myeloid cells and monocytes. We also demonstrate that there is a significant overlap between AML and MDS when MDS is defined on the basis of an arbitrary percentage of blasts of 20% or 30%. These data suggest that despite similarities between AML and MDS in their responses to treatment and outcomes, MDS is biologically and clinically different from AML and should not be considered an early phase of AML. The data indicate that MDS must be better defined on the basis of its biology rather than the percentage of blasts; further, the data suggest that there is a need to develop therapeutic approaches that specifically address the biologic abnormalities of MDS.",Comparative Study,6382.0,109.0,Myelodysplastic syndrome MDS disease characterized ineffective hematopoiesis significant biologic clinical differences MDS acute myeloid leukemia AML studied cohort 802 patients 279 35 newly diagnosed MDS 523 65 newly diagnosed AML compared clinical biologic characteristics 2 groups Complete clinical cytogenetic available patients subgroup patients studied apoptosis angiogenesis proliferation growth factors demonstrate MDS discrete entity different AML characterized primarily increased apoptosis early mature hematopoietic sorting loss heterozygosity demonstrate leukemic MDS patients capable differentiation mature myeloid monocytes demonstrate significant overlap AML MDS MDS defined basis arbitrary percentage blasts 20 30 suggest despite similarities AML MDS responses treatment outcomes MDS biologically clinically different AML considered early phase AML indicate MDS better defined basis percentage blasts suggest need develop therapeutic approaches specifically address biologic abnormalities MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[681, 1223, 16, 8, 34, 765, 20, 3957, 5114, 125, 32, 93, 1283, 2, 38, 362, 59, 1223, 2, 286, 533, 329, 21, 656, 8, 180, 1, 15135, 7, 8562, 465, 5, 732, 265, 1223, 2, 10674, 556, 5, 732, 265, 329, 2, 72, 38, 2, 1283, 374, 1, 3, 18, 271, 236, 38, 2, 1266, 74, 11, 390, 23, 62, 7, 2, 8, 1363, 1, 7, 10, 656, 9, 351, 1056, 457, 2, 129, 130, 114, 99, 608, 17, 1223, 16, 8, 5447, 2983, 17, 16, 338, 29, 329, 2, 16, 765, 1561, 20, 101, 351, 4, 191, 2, 2908, 1007, 37, 75, 31, 6751, 2, 407, 1, 3963, 21, 608, 17, 3, 2015, 37, 29, 1223, 7, 32, 2787, 1, 910, 237, 2908, 533, 37, 2, 5078, 21, 120, 608, 17, 125, 16, 8, 93, 4526, 59, 329, 2, 1223, 198, 1223, 16, 395, 23, 3, 877, 1, 35, 16183, 1150, 1, 2438, 1, 179, 15, 201, 46, 74, 309, 17, 550, 6089, 59, 329, 2, 1223, 4, 136, 253, 6, 24, 2, 123, 1223, 16, 2665, 2, 505, 338, 29, 329, 2, 257, 44, 40, 515, 35, 191, 124, 1, 329, 3, 74, 1008, 17, 1223, 1642, 40, 380, 395, 23, 3, 877, 1, 211, 891, 1832, 76, 3, 1150, 1, 2438, 195, 3, 74, 309, 17, 125, 16, 8, 594, 6, 690, 189, 611, 17, 1225, 1539, 3, 1283, 1171, 1, 1223]",1475.0,12130488,Myelodysplastic syndrome merely `` preleukemia '',35,0.06108202443280977
A phase I study of idarubicin dose escalation with amisfostine and high-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2002-08-01,"Early studies have suggested that increasing doses of anthracycline improve outcome in younger patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but dose escalation has been precluded by the acute and chronic toxicities of these agents. Amifostine is a cytoprotective compound that has been shown to protect against the acute cytotoxicities of anthracyclines in animal models. We report the results of a phase I study of dose escalation of idarubicin with amifostine and high-dose ara-C in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The continuous reassessment method was used to predict the probability of toxicity. Five patients were treated at an idarubicin dose of 18 mg/m2/day x 3, three of whom developed grade 3 diarrhea or mucositis.

The roles of FLT3 in hematopoiesis and leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2002-09-01,"FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by immature hematopoietic cells and is important for the normal development of stem cells and the immune system. The ligand for FLT3 is expressed by marrow stromal cells and other cells and synergizes with other growth factors to stimulate proliferation of stem cells, progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. Mutations of FLT3 have been detected in about 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and a small number of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients with FLT3 mutations tend to have a poor prognosis. The mutations most often involve small tandem duplications of amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor and result in constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of a mutant FLT3 receptor in murine marrow cells results in a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome and preliminary studies suggest that mutant FLT3 cooperates with other leukemia oncogenes to confer a more aggressive phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic target for kinase inhibitors or other approaches for patients with mutations of this gene.",Journal Article,6351.0,961.0,FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase expressed immature hematopoietic important normal development stem immune ligand FLT3 expressed marrow stromal synergizes growth factors stimulate proliferation stem progenitor dendritic natural killer FLT3 detected 30 patients acute myelogenous leukemia small number patients acute lymphocytic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome Patients FLT3 tend poor prognosis involve small tandem duplications amino acids juxtamembrane domain receptor constitutive tyrosine kinase activity Expression FLT3 receptor murine marrow lethal myeloproliferative syndrome preliminary studies suggest FLT3 cooperates leukemia oncogenes confer aggressive phenotype Taken suggest FLT3 attractive therapeutic target kinase inhibitors approaches patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1224, 16, 8, 153, 564, 216, 570, 20, 5733, 1007, 37, 2, 16, 305, 9, 3, 295, 193, 1, 452, 37, 2, 3, 250, 398, 3, 1232, 9, 1224, 16, 570, 20, 581, 1126, 37, 2, 127, 37, 2, 10824, 5, 127, 129, 130, 6, 4223, 457, 1, 452, 37, 2520, 37, 2464, 37, 2, 1504, 3458, 37, 138, 1, 1224, 47, 85, 530, 4, 545, 201, 1, 7, 5, 286, 2194, 2, 8, 302, 207, 1, 7, 5, 286, 1193, 15, 681, 7, 5, 1224, 138, 5406, 6, 47, 8, 334, 356, 3, 138, 96, 629, 3882, 302, 2905, 8910, 1, 3078, 4562, 262, 3, 10541, 1398, 1, 3, 153, 2, 757, 4, 3178, 564, 216, 128, 55, 1, 8, 620, 1224, 153, 4, 1471, 581, 37, 99, 4, 8, 2266, 681, 2, 1676, 94, 309, 17, 620, 1224, 12535, 5, 127, 3326, 6, 2913, 8, 80, 571, 1005, 1633, 1162, 46, 99, 309, 17, 1224, 16, 35, 3059, 189, 283, 9, 216, 222, 15, 127, 611, 9, 7, 5, 138, 1, 26, 145]",1126.0,12176867,roles FLT3 hematopoiesis leukemia,10,0.017452006980802792

Clin. Oncol.,2002-09-01,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may have disease transformation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or prolymphocytic leukemia; however, development of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is unusual. A series of patients enrolled onto an intergroup CLL trial were examined for this complication. A total of 544 previously untreated B-cell CLL patients were enrolled onto a randomized intergroup study comparing treatment with chlorambucil, fludarabine, or fludarabine plus chlorambucil. Case report forms from 521 patients were reviewed for t-AML. With a median follow-up of 4.2 years, six patients (1.2%) to date have developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS; n = 3), t-AML (n = 2), or t-MDS evolving to t-AML (n = 1), from 27 to 53 months (median, 34 months) after study entry. This included five (3.5%) of 142 patients treated with fludarabine plus chlorambucil and one (0.5%) of 188 receiving fludarabine; no chlorambucil-treated patients developed t-MDS or t-AML (P =.007). At study entry, the median age among these six patients was 56 years (range, 44 to 72 years); three were male; the CLL Rai stage was I/II (n = 4) or III/IV (n = 2). Response to CLL therapy was complete (n = 4) or partial remission (n = 1) and stable disease (n = 1). Marrow cytogenetics, obtained in three of six cases at diagnosis of t-MDS or t-AML, were complex, with abnormalities in either or both chromosomes 5 and 7. Other abnormalities involved chromosomes X, 1, 8, 12, 17, and 19. Median survival after diagnosis of t-MDS/AML was 3.5 months (range, 0.5 to 10.1 months).

Second malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-10-01,"The authors investigated the incidence and relative risk of secondary malignant neoplasms in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma. A comprehensive list of 509 patients with primary osteosarcoma treated at our institution between February 1973 and March 2000 was identified. All study patients received chemotherapy and/or surgery on one of six different protocols (T4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and CCG-7921/POG-9351). Chemotherapy was scheduled for up to 40 weeks with some variations in the actual treatment period and consisted of various combinations of the following agents: high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, vincristine, cisplatin, and ifosfamide. Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) occurred in 14 of 509 patients. Only one had pulmonary metastasis at diagnosis and subsequent multiple recurrences that required thoracotomies and further modification of the chemotherapy regimen. The median age at diagnosis for osteosarcoma was 16.6 years (range, 3.1-74.4 years). The median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0.1-25.0 years). The time interval from diagnosis of the primary osteosarcoma to the development of SMN was 1.3-13.1 years (median, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-9.6). The most common SMN occurred in the central nervous system (n = 4): anaplastic glioma, meningioma, high-grade glioma, and maxillary astrocytoma. There were two cases of acute myeloid leukemia and one case each of myelodysplastic syndrome, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, breast carcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The overall 5 and 10-year cumulative incidences of SMNs were 1.4% +/- 1.1% and 3.1% +/- 1.8%. The standardized incidence ratio was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.53-7.78, P = 0.00001) for the cohort and 3.64 (95% CI, 1.82-6.52, P = 0.0007) when patients with a history of retinoblastoma or Rothmund-Thomson syndrome were excluded. The overall incidence of secondary malignancies in long-term survivors of osteosarcoma was significantly higher than the expected incidence of cancer in the general population. However, the standardized incidence ratios were much lower than those reported for Hodgkin disease and retinoblastoma. Although additional follow-up is warranted, the successes of current treatment regimens consisting of intensive, high-dose chemotherapy in combination with topoisomerase II inhibitors outweigh the risks.",Journal Article,6321.0,69.0,authors investigated incidence relative risk secondary malignant neoplasms long-term survivors osteosarcoma comprehensive list 509 patients primary osteosarcoma treated institution February 1973 March 2000 identified patients received chemotherapy and/or surgery different protocols T4 5 7 10 12 CCG-7921/POG-9351 Chemotherapy scheduled 40 weeks variations actual treatment period consisted combinations following agents high-dose methotrexate doxorubicin bleomycin cyclophosphamide dactinomycin vincristine cisplatin ifosfamide Secondary malignant neoplasms SMN occurred 14 509 patients pulmonary metastasis diagnosis subsequent multiple recurrences required thoracotomies modification chemotherapy regimen median age diagnosis osteosarcoma 16.6 years range 3.1-74.4 years median follow-up 5.2 years range 0.1-25.0 years time interval diagnosis primary osteosarcoma development SMN 1.3-13.1 years median 5.5 95 confidence interval CI 3.6-9.6 common SMN occurred central nervous n 4 anaplastic glioma meningioma high-grade glioma maxillary astrocytoma cases acute myeloid leukemia case myelodysplastic syndrome non-Hodgkin lymphoma high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma leiomyosarcoma fibrosarcoma breast carcinoma mucoepidermoid carcinoma overall 5 10-year cumulative incidences SMNs 1.4 +/- 1.1 3.1 +/- 1.8 standardized incidence ratio 4.6 95 CI 2.53-7.78 P 0.00001 cohort 3.64 95 CI 1.82-6.52 P 0.0007 patients history retinoblastoma Rothmund-Thomson syndrome excluded overall incidence secondary malignancies long-term survivors osteosarcoma significantly higher expected incidence general population standardized incidence ratios lower reported Hodgkin disease retinoblastoma additional follow-up warranted successes current treatment regimens consisting intensive high-dose chemotherapy combination topoisomerase II inhibitors outweigh risks,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 738, 565, 3, 287, 2, 580, 43, 1, 568, 393, 1179, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 8, 949, 4754, 1, 8727, 7, 5, 86, 73, 28, 114, 731, 59, 3010, 4756, 2, 2363, 1081, 10, 108, 62, 45, 7, 103, 56, 2, 15, 152, 23, 104, 1, 437, 338, 2189, 2463, 33, 67, 79, 133, 2, 9457, 53147, 17150, 53148, 56, 10, 4394, 9, 126, 6, 327, 244, 5, 476, 2293, 4, 3, 3480, 24, 727, 2, 1695, 1, 747, 1247, 1, 3, 366, 183, 64, 61, 2116, 856, 5213, 1112, 10295, 2132, 540, 2, 3157, 568, 393, 1179, 6474, 489, 4, 213, 1, 8727, 7, 158, 104, 42, 1087, 278, 28, 147, 2, 706, 232, 1593, 17, 616, 15525, 2, 195, 2437, 1, 3, 56, 477, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 9, 10, 245, 49, 60, 184, 27, 14, 794, 39, 60, 3, 52, 166, 126, 10, 33, 18, 60, 184, 13, 14, 243, 13, 60, 3, 98, 268, 29, 147, 1, 3, 86, 6, 3, 193, 1, 6474, 10, 14, 27, 233, 14, 60, 52, 33, 33, 48, 307, 268, 58, 27, 49, 83, 49, 3, 96, 186, 6474, 489, 4, 3, 854, 1880, 398, 78, 39, 1841, 945, 3944, 64, 88, 945, 2, 11399, 3822, 125, 11, 100, 140, 1, 286, 533, 2, 104, 473, 296, 1, 681, 64, 88, 4581, 3717, 8378, 134, 2, 10832, 134, 3, 63, 33, 2, 79, 111, 967, 3981, 1, 6580, 11, 14, 39, 14, 14, 2, 27, 14, 14, 66, 3, 1670, 287, 197, 10, 39, 49, 48, 58, 18, 699, 67, 833, 19, 13, 7868, 9, 3, 180, 2, 27, 660, 48, 58, 14, 878, 49, 653, 19, 13, 6626, 198, 7, 5, 8, 532, 1, 15, 43048, 33305, 681, 11, 1800, 3, 63, 287, 1, 568, 441, 4, 319, 337, 332, 1, 10, 97, 142, 76, 3, 1336, 287, 1, 12, 4, 3, 1083, 266, 137, 3, 1670, 287, 1137, 11, 1802, 280, 76, 135, 210, 9, 34, 2, 242, 402, 166, 126, 16, 1197, 3, 6697, 1, 291, 24, 472, 2273, 1, 1686, 64, 61, 56, 4, 150, 5, 3999, 215, 222, 11592, 3, 1098]",2164.0,12365021,Second malignant neoplasms long-term survivors osteosarcoma Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center Experience,2,0.0034904013961605585
Skeletal manifestations of pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2002-10-01,"Once considered rare, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) now accounts for about 12% of all cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia in children. Most cases of AMKL are difficult to diagnose because of their complex clinical presentation and unusual bone marrow morphologic features. In children, AMKL is often confused with metastatic solid tumors or myelodysplastic syndrome. Between January 1984 and December 1999, 43 patients were diagnosed with childhood AMKL at the authors' institution. Five of these presented with unusual skeletal lesions.

"Intravenous versus oral busulfan as part of a busulfan/cyclophosphamide preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: decreased incidence of hepatic venoocclusive disease (HVOD), HVOD-related mortality, and overall 100-day mortality.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2002-01-01,"Hepatic venoocclusive disease (HVOD) is a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is a well-recognized dose-limiting toxicity of oral busulfan (Bu)-based preparative regimens. The unpredictable absorption of oral Bu from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and hepatic first-pass effects have led to the development of an intravenous Bu preparation (i.v. Bu). The purpose of this retrospective comparison was to evaluate the incidence rate of HVOD and the 100-day mortality rate in patients treated with a busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) regimen in which either oral Bu or i.v. Bu was administered. Data from 2 similar groups of patients treated between March 1995 and December 1997 were analyzed. Thirty patients were treated with oral Bu (1 mg/kg x 16 doses) at City of Hope and 61 patients were treated with i.v. Bu (0.8 mg/kg x 16 doses) in a multicenter trial involving 7 sites. Bu was followed by Cy (60 mg/kg x 2 days) and a histocompatible-sibling-donor HSCT. In the i.v. Bu treatment group, 48% of the patients were classified as heavily pretreated (> or = 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, prior radiation, or prior HSCT) with 13% having had a prior HSCT and 75% having active disease at the time of transplantation. According to the same classification criteria, 33% of the patients in the oral-Bu treatment group were considered heavily pretreated, with 23% having had a prior HSCT and 80% having active disease at the time of transplantation. The incidence rates of clinically diagnosed HVOD were 5/61 (8%) and 10/30 (33%) after i.v. and oral Bu, respectively. HVOD-related mortality occurred in 2 (3.3%) of 61 i.v. and 6 (20%) of 30 oral Bu patients. The (standardized) Jones criteria for HVOD were met by 4.9% of i.v. and 20% of oral Bu patients. Univariate logistic regression analysis identified oral versus i.v. Bu (P = .001) and a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (P = .04) as statistically significant factors in the development of HVOD, with prior extensive treatment identified as marginally significant (P = .25). No other demographic parameter was found to be significant. After adjustment for prior treatment, multivariate analyses showed that the use of oral versus i.v. Bu was the strongest predictor for development of HVOD (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-27.2; P = .002). This study showed that the incidence rate of HVOD is significantly lower (P = .002) and the 100-day survival rate significantly higher (P = .002) in patients treated with i.v. Bu than in patients treated with oral Bu when Bu is used as part of a BuCy2 preparative regimen for allogeneic HSCT.",Clinical Trial,6594.0,183.0,Hepatic venoocclusive disease HVOD complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation HSCT well-recognized dose-limiting toxicity oral busulfan Bu -based preparative regimens unpredictable absorption oral Bu gastrointestinal GI tract hepatic first-pass effects led development intravenous Bu preparation i.v Bu purpose retrospective comparison evaluate incidence rate HVOD 100-day mortality rate patients treated busulfan/cyclophosphamide BuCy2 regimen oral Bu i.v Bu administered 2 similar groups patients treated March 1995 December 1997 Thirty patients treated oral Bu 1 mg/kg x 16 doses City Hope 61 patients treated i.v Bu 0.8 mg/kg x 16 doses multicenter trial involving 7 sites Bu followed Cy 60 mg/kg x 2 days histocompatible-sibling-donor HSCT i.v Bu treatment group 48 patients classified heavily pretreated 3 prior chemotherapy regimens prior radiation prior HSCT 13 prior HSCT 75 active disease time transplantation According classification criteria 33 patients oral-Bu treatment group considered heavily pretreated 23 prior HSCT 80 active disease time transplantation incidence rates clinically diagnosed HVOD 5/61 8 10/30 33 i.v oral Bu respectively HVOD-related mortality occurred 2 3.3 61 i.v 6 20 30 oral Bu patients standardized Jones criteria HVOD met 4.9 i.v 20 oral Bu patients Univariate logistic regression identified oral versus i.v Bu P .001 diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome P .04 statistically significant factors development HVOD prior extensive treatment identified marginally significant P .25 demographic parameter significant adjustment prior treatment multivariate showed use oral versus i.v Bu strongest predictor development HVOD odds ratio 7.5 95 confidence interval 2.1-27.2 P .002 showed incidence rate HVOD significantly lower P .002 100-day survival rate significantly higher P .002 patients treated i.v Bu patients treated oral Bu Bu BuCy2 preparative regimen allogeneic HSCT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[939, 20232, 34, 24519, 16, 8, 1447, 1, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 2, 16, 8, 149, 1904, 61, 817, 155, 1, 518, 3906, 3667, 90, 6085, 472, 3, 8907, 6125, 1, 518, 3667, 29, 3, 2104, 1696, 2, 939, 157, 10152, 176, 47, 836, 6, 3, 193, 1, 35, 1262, 3667, 4824, 70, 603, 3667, 3, 743, 1, 26, 459, 1155, 10, 6, 376, 3, 287, 116, 1, 24519, 2, 3, 394, 218, 282, 116, 4, 7, 73, 5, 8, 3906, 1112, 27967, 477, 4, 92, 361, 518, 3667, 15, 70, 603, 3667, 10, 468, 74, 29, 18, 288, 271, 1, 7, 73, 59, 2363, 2323, 2, 1397, 2341, 11, 311, 977, 7, 11, 73, 5, 518, 3667, 14, 81, 503, 1006, 245, 415, 28, 7235, 1, 3045, 2, 713, 7, 11, 73, 5, 70, 603, 3667, 13, 66, 81, 503, 1006, 245, 415, 4, 8, 1570, 160, 1267, 67, 633, 3667, 10, 370, 20, 5757, 335, 81, 503, 1006, 18, 162, 2, 8, 30254, 3684, 1488, 1703, 4, 3, 70, 603, 3667, 24, 87, 576, 1, 3, 7, 11, 1373, 22, 2447, 2193, 15, 27, 324, 56, 472, 324, 121, 15, 324, 1703, 5, 233, 1041, 42, 8, 324, 1703, 2, 481, 1041, 544, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 497, 768, 6, 3, 827, 947, 371, 466, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 518, 3667, 24, 87, 11, 515, 2447, 2193, 5, 382, 1041, 42, 8, 324, 1703, 2, 493, 1041, 544, 34, 28, 3, 98, 1, 497, 3, 287, 151, 1, 505, 265, 24519, 11, 33, 713, 66, 2, 79, 201, 466, 50, 70, 603, 2, 518, 3667, 106, 24519, 139, 282, 489, 4, 18, 27, 27, 1, 713, 70, 603, 2, 49, 179, 1, 201, 518, 3667, 7, 3, 1670, 21078, 371, 9, 24519, 11, 543, 20, 39, 83, 1, 70, 603, 2, 179, 1, 518, 3667, 7, 880, 812, 320, 65, 108, 518, 185, 70, 603, 3667, 19, 144, 2, 8, 147, 1, 681, 19, 755, 22, 712, 93, 130, 4, 3, 193, 1, 24519, 5, 324, 1344, 24, 108, 22, 5007, 93, 19, 243, 77, 127, 1540, 4219, 10, 204, 6, 40, 93, 50, 1852, 9, 324, 24, 331, 318, 224, 17, 3, 119, 1, 518, 185, 70, 603, 3667, 10, 3, 3311, 980, 9, 193, 1, 24519, 610, 197, 67, 33, 48, 307, 268, 18, 14, 428, 18, 19, 1111, 26, 45, 224, 17, 3, 287, 116, 1, 24519, 16, 97, 280, 19, 1111, 2, 3, 394, 218, 25, 116, 97, 142, 19, 1111, 4, 7, 73, 5, 70, 603, 3667, 76, 4, 7, 73, 5, 518, 3667, 198, 3667, 16, 95, 22, 760, 1, 8, 27967, 6085, 477, 9, 1063, 1703]",2506.0,12374454,Intravenous versus oral busulfan busulfan/cyclophosphamide preparative regimen allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation decreased incidence hepatic venoocclusive disease HVOD HVOD-related mortality overall 100-day mortality,52,0.09075043630017451
Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels have prognostic significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia but not in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,Cancer,Cancer,2002-11-01,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are positive regulators of angiogenesis. Increased levels in urine, serum, plasma, or malignant tissue have been associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with solid tumors. The authors used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure VEGF and bFGF levels in plasma samples from 99 patients with previously untreated myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (n = 41 patients; 42%) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 58 patients; 58%) and compared the results with the results from a group of normal control participants. Increased expression levels of VEGF and bFGF were found in the plasma from patients with AML and MDS (P < 0.01) compared with the levels found in the control group. Plasma levels of VEGF in patients with AML or MDS were similar (median, 30.63 pg/mL and 34.41 pg/mL, respectively). There was no significant difference in bFGF levels between patients with AML and patients with MDS (median, 6.38 pg/mL and 6.98 pg/mL, respectively). Elevated levels of VEGF were associated with reduced survival (P = 0.02) in patients with AML as well as lower complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.004). Elevated VEGF levels were not associated with reduced remission duration (CRD) in patients with AML. There was no correlation between VEGF levels and survival, CRD, or CR rates in patients with MDS. There was no correlation between bFGF levels and CR rates or survival in patients with either AML or MDS. Plasma VEGF levels have prognostic significance in patients with AML.

"Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and NQO1 in children who developed therapy-related myeloid malignancies.",Pharmacogenetics,Pharmacogenetics,2002-11-01,"Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (t-ML) are serious complications that affect some patients after acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Genetic polymorphisms in the promoter of CYP3A4 (CYP3A4*1B) and in NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1609C-->T substitution) have been associated with the risk of t-ML. A polymorphism in CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) affects CYP3A activity and the wild-type allele (CYP3A5*1) is in partial linkage with the CYP3A4*1B allele. We compared the genotype frequencies for the CYP3A5*3, the CYP3A4*1B and the NQO1609C-->T substitution in 224 children with ALL who did not develop t-ML (controls) and in 53 children with ALL who did develop the complication. The allele frequencies differed significantly among whites, blacks and Hispanics (P < 0.001 for CYP3A5*3, P < 0.001 for CYP3A4*1B and P = 0.004 for NQO1609), thus we performed the comparisons between ALL controls and t-ML patients after accounting for race. We found no differences in the CYP3A4*1B allele distribution between ALL controls and t-ML patients in whites (P = 0.339, 6.6% vs. 9.8%), blacks (P = 0.498, 93.8% vs. 87.5%) or Hispanics (P = 0.523, 39.1% vs. 25.0%).

Advancing the treatment of hematologic malignancies through the development of targeted interventions.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2002-10-01,"Significant advances have been made in the development of targeted interventions for hematologic malignancies. Progress has been made in defining the molecular pathogenesis of human leukemias. Data indicate that nonrandom, somatically acquired translocations, inversions, and other abnormalities occur in many acute leukemias. In the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), targeted therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy leads to dramatic improvements in disease-free survival. Imatinib mesylate, a signal transduction inhibitor that inhibits tyrosine kinase activity, the protein product of the ABL proto-oncogene, has remarkable activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), a promising class of agents that target multiple pathways including Ras proteins, are potential anticancer therapy for a wide range of malignancies, including leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). There also is evidence that recombinant human erythropoietin therapy (r-HuEPO) can benefit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. This supplement will discuss advances in our understanding of human leukemias, including the use of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies such as Campath-1H (Wellcome, Beckenham, UK, and Ilex Oncology, San Antonio, TX) and rituximab and immunoconjugates such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin and BL-22.

Epoetin alfa as a supportive measure in hematologic malignancies.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2002-10-01,"Anemia is prevalent among cancer patients with hematologic malignancies, with fatigue and weakness, major symptoms of anemia, contributing to diminished quality of life (QOL). Data from several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and three large community-based studies in patients with hematologic malignancies indicate that recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO, epoetin alfa) can correct anemia, reduce transfusion requirements, and improve QOL. Moreover, a positive relationship has been found between increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels and improvements in QOL assessments, regardless of disease state, with the greatest incremental improvement occurring when Hb increases from 11 g/dL to 12 g/dL (range, 11 to 13 g/dL). This suggests that patients with mild-to-moderate anemia may achieve the greatest QOL benefit from epoetin alfa therapy. Evidence from community-based studies suggests that epoetin alfa administered once weekly has a similar safety and efficacy profile as three-times-weekly administration. Further research is ongoing with less frequent dosing regimens. The beneficial effects of epoetin alfa therapy have been reported in studies involving patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. Evidence also exists that epoetin alfa can benefit patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), although these results have not been as impressive. Combining epoetin alfa with other cytokine growth factors may confer some additional benefit in these patients, but more rigorous investigation is required.",Journal Article,6321.0,9.0,Anemia prevalent patients hematologic malignancies fatigue weakness major symptoms anemia contributing diminished quality life QOL randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials large community-based studies patients hematologic malignancies indicate recombinant human erythropoietin r-HuEPO epoetin alfa correct anemia reduce transfusion requirements improve QOL positive relationship increased hemoglobin Hb levels improvements QOL assessments regardless disease state greatest incremental improvement occurring Hb increases 11 g/dL 12 g/dL range 11 13 g/dL suggests patients mild-to-moderate anemia achieve greatest QOL benefit epoetin alfa therapy Evidence community-based studies suggests epoetin alfa administered weekly similar safety efficacy profile three-times-weekly administration research ongoing frequent dosing regimens beneficial effects epoetin alfa therapy reported studies involving patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL multiple myeloma lymphomas Evidence exists epoetin alfa benefit patients myelodysplastic syndromes MDS impressive Combining epoetin alfa cytokine growth factors confer additional benefit patients rigorous investigation required,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[1545, 16, 2485, 107, 12, 7, 5, 813, 441, 5, 613, 2, 6408, 458, 507, 1, 1545, 3156, 6, 2849, 372, 1, 358, 1001, 74, 29, 392, 384, 619, 1149, 38, 143, 2, 169, 375, 1714, 90, 94, 4, 7, 5, 813, 441, 1008, 17, 2835, 171, 6266, 668, 21090, 7305, 4443, 122, 4883, 1545, 969, 2785, 4230, 2, 401, 1001, 1393, 8, 109, 858, 71, 85, 204, 59, 101, 2222, 5753, 148, 2, 1474, 4, 1001, 2182, 1583, 1, 34, 1309, 5, 3, 2199, 3648, 767, 1821, 198, 5753, 1106, 29, 175, 499, 1826, 6, 133, 499, 1826, 184, 175, 6, 233, 499, 1826, 26, 844, 17, 7, 5, 1980, 6, 1163, 1545, 68, 1359, 3, 2199, 1001, 247, 29, 7305, 4443, 36, 241, 29, 1714, 90, 94, 844, 17, 7305, 4443, 468, 1059, 709, 71, 8, 288, 367, 2, 209, 800, 22, 169, 1072, 709, 634, 195, 389, 16, 942, 5, 299, 908, 1280, 472, 3, 2524, 176, 1, 7305, 4443, 36, 47, 85, 210, 4, 94, 1267, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 232, 2, 1557, 241, 120, 2481, 17, 7305, 4443, 122, 247, 7, 5, 2040, 1223, 242, 46, 99, 47, 44, 85, 22, 5790, 1525, 7305, 4443, 5, 127, 1675, 129, 130, 68, 2913, 476, 402, 247, 4, 46, 7, 84, 80, 6496, 940, 16, 616]",1500.0,12447849,Epoetin alfa supportive measure hematologic malignancies,2,0.0034904013961605585

Clinical manifestations of such phenomena may include an acute systemic vasculitic syndrome, skin vasculitis, fever, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrates, peripheral polyneuropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, and even classical connective tissue disorders, such as relapsing polychondritis. On the other hand, asymptomatic immunologic abnormalities have also been reported in these patients. These autoimmune manifestations frequently respond to immunosuppressive agents including steroids and occasional hematologic responses to steroid therapy have also been reported. We report five patients with history of MDS who manifested different spectrums of autoimmune phenomena including: pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), vasculitis, Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We also review the incidence, nature, course and response to therapy of these manifestations and discuss potential pathogenic mechanisms.",Case Reports,6290.0,111.0,Autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes commonly encountered patients myelodysplastic syndromes MDS review case reports small series suggest 10 MDS patients experience autoimmune syndromes Clinical manifestations phenomena include acute systemic vasculitic syndrome skin vasculitis fever arthritis pulmonary infiltrates peripheral polyneuropathy inflammatory bowel disease glomerulonephritis classical connective tissue disorders relapsing polychondritis hand asymptomatic immunologic abnormalities reported patients autoimmune manifestations frequently respond immunosuppressive agents including steroids occasional hematologic responses steroid therapy reported report patients history MDS manifested different spectrums autoimmune phenomena including pyoderma gangrenosum PG vasculitis Coombs negative hemolytic anemia idiopathic thrombocytopenia chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy CIDP review incidence nature course response therapy manifestations discuss potential pathogenic mechanisms,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3445, 6544, 2040, 32, 841, 3903, 4, 7, 5, 2040, 1223, 8, 206, 1, 473, 1198, 2, 302, 988, 309, 22, 445, 22, 79, 1, 1223, 7, 68, 730, 747, 3445, 2040, 38, 4282, 1, 225, 11549, 68, 643, 35, 286, 403, 37370, 681, 18850, 2775, 8646, 1087, 5942, 672, 14469, 1291, 1659, 34, 26106, 2, 871, 3781, 10990, 246, 1997, 225, 22, 6758, 53332, 23, 3, 127, 2833, 2100, 3042, 1171, 47, 120, 85, 210, 4, 46, 7, 46, 3445, 4282, 746, 1892, 6, 2989, 183, 141, 4580, 2, 9753, 813, 253, 6, 3853, 36, 47, 120, 85, 210, 21, 414, 365, 7, 5, 532, 1, 1223, 54, 6023, 338, 37110, 1, 3445, 11549, 141, 43141, 43142, 3234, 18850, 43143, 199, 10425, 1545, 7540, 1340, 2, 442, 1291, 19540, 14469, 37371, 21, 120, 206, 3, 287, 2202, 906, 2, 51, 6, 36, 1, 46, 4282, 2, 1139, 174, 2806, 483]",1188.0,12533032,Autoimmune phenomena patients myelodysplastic syndromes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,72,0.1256544502617801
Randomized comparison of ABVD and MOPP/ABV hybrid for the treatment of advanced Hodgkin's disease: report of an intergroup trial.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-02-01,"In a series of trials, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) and mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPP/ABV) have been identified as effective treatments for Hodgkin's disease. We compared these regimens as initial chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. Adult patients (N = 856) with advanced Hodgkin's disease were randomly assigned to treatment with ABVD or MOPP/ABV. The major end points were failure-free and overall survival, life-threatening acute toxicities, and serious long-term toxicities, including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary toxicity, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and secondary malignancies. The rates of complete remission (76% v 80%, P =.16), failure-free survival at 5 years (63% v 66%, P =.42), and overall survival at 5 years (82% v 81%, P =.82) were similar for ABVD and MOPP/ABV, respectively. Clinically significant acute pulmonary and hematologic toxicity were more common with MOPP/ABV (P =.060 and.001, respectively). There was no difference in cardiac toxicity. There were 24 deaths attributed to initial treatment: nine with ABVD and 15 with MOPP/ABV (P =.057). There have been 18 second malignancies associated with ABVD and 28 associated with MOPP/ABV (P =.13). Thirteen patients have developed MDS or acute leukemia: 11 were initially treated with MOPP/ABV, and two were initially treated with ABVD but subsequently received MOPP-containing regimens and radiotherapy before developing leukemia (P =.011). ABVD and the MOPP/ABV hybrid are effective therapies for Hodgkin's disease. MOPP/ABV is associated with a greater incidence of acute toxicity, MDS, and leukemia.

Adults with AML or high-risk MDS and cytogenetic abnormalities other than inv (16), t(8;21), -Y or -X were randomized to receive liposomal daunorubicin (DNX) and ara-C (DA) or DNX and topotecan (DT). Within each arm, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone (DA or DT) or with thalidomide (DATh or DTTh). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels and microvascular density was measured before and after therapy. Eighty-four patients (median age, 65 years; range, 27-84 years) were treated. None of 11 patients treated with DT or DTTh responded and these arms were closed. Seventeen of 37 patients treated with DA and 15 of 36 treated with DATh achieved an early complete remission. Median complete response duration was 38 and 34 weeks (P = 0.57) and median survival 35 and 28 weeks (P = 0.15), respectively. Patients with high pretreatment VEGF levels had an inferior survival.

Acquired FANCA dysfunction and cytogenetic instability in adult acute myelogenous leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2003-03-13,"Myelodysplastic and leukemic stem cell clones that evolve in children and adults with Fanconi anemia universally bear complex cytogenetic abnormalities. The abnormalities are generally recurring deletions or chromosomal loss and involve precisely the same chromosomes with the same frequency as has been described in marrow cells from patients with secondary acute leukemia induced by alkylating agents. Reasoning that acquired Fanconi anemia protein dysfunction might contribute to cytogenetic instability in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, we analyzed leukemic cells bearing characteristic complex cytogenetic defects obtained from a 68-year-old man whose lymphoblasts showed no evidence of Fanconi anemia. Unlike the lymphoblasts, this myeloid leukemia cell line (UoC-M1) was hypersensitive to mitomycin-C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB) and exhibited a marked decrease in nuclear FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2-L. Retroviral transduction of FANCA significantly reduced MMC sensitivity but FANCF, FANCG, and FANCC did not. Overexpression of FANCA restored levels of both FANCA and FANCG, whereas overexpression of FANCG or FANCC did not restore FANCA levels. The molecular mass of cytoplasmic FANCA, FANCG, FANCC, and nuclear FANCD2 were normal. All exons of FANCA and FANCG were sequenced, and no mutations were found. We conclude that perturbations of as yet unidentified factors that govern the binding activity or intracellular localization of FANCA may promote cytogenetic instability and clonal progression in patients with AML who do not have Fanconi anemia.",Journal Article,6158.0,39.0,Myelodysplastic leukemic stem clones evolve children adults Fanconi anemia universally bear complex cytogenetic abnormalities abnormalities generally recurring deletions chromosomal loss involve precisely chromosomes frequency described marrow patients secondary acute leukemia induced alkylating agents Reasoning acquired Fanconi anemia dysfunction contribute cytogenetic instability secondary acute myelogenous leukemia AML leukemic bearing characteristic complex cytogenetic defects obtained 68-year-old man lymphoblasts showed evidence Fanconi anemia Unlike lymphoblasts myeloid leukemia line UoC-M1 hypersensitive mitomycin-C MMC diepoxybutane DEB exhibited marked decrease nuclear FANCA FANCG FANCD2-L.

This study was conducted to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of its combination with cytarabine (ara-C), idarubicin, or topotecan. Patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), advanced myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were initially randomly assigned to receive troxacitabine 5.0 mg/m(2) by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on days 1 to 5 with ara-C 1.0 g/m(2)/d IV [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] over 2 hours on days 1 to 5, idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) by 5 minute IV infusion on days 1 to 3, or topotecan 1.0 mg/m(2) as an continuous IV infusion on days 1 to 5. Doses were then adjusted to define DLT for each combination. Eighty-seven patients (68 AML, eight MDS, 11 CML-BP) were treated. DLTs were hepatic transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hand foot syndrome (HFS) on the troxacitabine plus ara-C combination. The recommended phase II doses were 6 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days and 1.0g/m(2) once a day for 5 days, respectively. DLTs were diarrhea, rash, and mucositis on the troxacitabine plus topotecan combination. The recommended phase II doses were 4 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days and 0.75 mg/m(2) once a day for 5 days, respectively. DLTs were HFS, rash, and mucositis on the troxacitabine plus idarubicin combination.

"SU5416, a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, has biologic activity in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.",Blood,Blood,2003-03-20,"Increased bone marrow angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are adverse prognostic features in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). VEGF is a soluble circulating angiogenic molecule that stimulates signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). AML blasts may express VEGFR-2, c-kit, and FLT3. SU5416 is a small molecule RTK inhibitor (RTKI) of VEGFR-2, c-kit, and both wild-type and mutant FLT3. A multicenter phase 2 study of SU5416 was conducted in patients with refractory AML or MDS. For a median of 9 weeks (range, 1-55 weeks), 55 patients (33 AML: 10 [30%] primary refractory, 23 [70%] relapsed; 22 MDS: 15 [68%] relapsed) received 145 mg/m2 SU5416 twice weekly intravenously. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicities included headaches (14%), infusion-related reactions (11%), dyspnea (14%), fatigue (7%), thrombotic episodes (7%), bone pain (5%), and gastrointestinal disturbance (4%). There were 11 patients (20%) who did not complete 4 weeks of therapy (10 progressive disease, 1 adverse event); 3 patients (5%) who achieved partial responses; and 1 (2%) who achieved hematologic improvement. Single agent SU5416 had biologic and modest clinical activity in refractory AML/MDS. Overall median survival was 12 weeks in AML patients (range, 4-41 weeks) and not reached in MDS patients. Most observed toxicities were attributable to drug formulation (polyoxyl 35 castor oil or hyperosmolarity of the SU5416 preparation).

New malignancies after blood or marrow stem-cell transplantation in children and adults: incidence and risk factors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-04-01,"To determine the incidence and risk factors for the development of new malignancies occurring after stem-cell transplantation (SCT). Between January 1, 1974, and March 31, 2001, 3,372 patients underwent SCT at the University of Minnesota. From these transplants, 147 posttransplant malignancies (PTMs) were identified in 137 patients. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers (n = 19) and carcinoma-in-situ (n = 5), the remaining 123 cases represented an 8.1-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 9.6) increased risk of a PTM, an excess risk of 102.7 cases/10,000 persons/yr (age and sex adjusted). This includes a significantly elevated risk for developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML; standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 300; 95% CI, 210 to 406), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD; SIR = 54.3; 95% CI, 39.5 to 41.1), Hodgkin's disease (SIR = 14.8; 95% CI, 3.9 to 32.9), or solid tumors overall (SIR = 2.8; CI, 2.0 to 3.7) and in specific for melanoma, brain, and oral cavity tumors. The cumulative incidence for the development of any PTM was 6.9% (95% CI, 5.2 to 8.6) at 20 years post-SCT. For PTLD (n = 43), the cumulative incidence plateaued at 1.4% (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) by 10 years post-SCT. For MDS or AML, the cumulative incidence plateaued at 1.4% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) by 10 years post-SCT. The cumulative incidence of developing a solid tumor did not plateau and was 3.8% (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.4) at 20 years post-SCT.

Prior gemtuzumab ozogamicin exposure significantly increases the risk of veno-occlusive disease in patients who undergo myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2003-05-08,"Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been linked to the development of venoocclusive disease (VOD). We conducted a retrospective study of 62 patients with previously treated AML/MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) who underwent allogeneic stem cell (SC) transplantation at our institution from December 2000 to October 2002 to determine whether GO exposure prior to allogeneic SC transplantation increases the risk of developing VOD. Fourteen patients received GO prior to SC transplantation. Of 62 patients, 13 (21%) developed VOD; 9 (64%) of 14 with prior GO exposure developed VOD compared with 4 (8%) of 48 without prior GO exposure (P <.0001). Logistic regression controlling for sex, disease status, donor type, and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis identified prior treatment with GO as a significant risk factor for VOD (odds ratio [OR], 21.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2-112.2].

"Results of imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with refractory or recurrent acute myeloid leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and myeloproliferative disorders.",Cancer,Cancer,2003-06-01,"Imatinib mesylate is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-abl, bcr/abl, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (PDGF-R). c-kit is expressed in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The authors investigated the efficacy of imatinib in patients with these disorders. Forty-eight patients with AML (n = 10), MDS (n = 8), myelofibrosis (n = 18), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 7), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n = 3), or polycythemia vera (n = 2) were treated with imatinib 400 mg daily. None of the patients with AML or MDS responded. Among patients with myelofibrosis, 10 of 14 patients with splenomegaly (71%) had a 30% or greater reduction in spleen size, 1 patient had trilineage hematologic improvement, 2 had erythroid hematologic improvement, and 1 had improvement in platelet count. One patient with atypical CML had erythroid hematologic improvement. Both patients with polycythemia vera needed fewer phlebotomies (from 2-3 per year to none during the 8 months of therapy and from 3-6 per year to 1 during 9 months of therapy). None of the three patients with CMML responded. Treatment was well tolerated. The side effects were similar to those observed in patients with CML. Within these small subgroups of disease types, single-agent imatinib did not achieve a significant clinical response among patients with AML, MDS, atypical CML, or CMML without PDGF-R fusion genes. Preliminary data on polycythemia vera are promising and deserve further investigation. Responses among myelofibrosis patients were minor.

Splenic histopathological patterns in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with clinical correlations: reinforcement of the heterogeneity of the syndrome.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2003-09-01,"The syndrome of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) includes a heterogeneous group of patients who exhibit both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative clinicopathological features. Troublesome splenomegaly is uncommon in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but when organomegaly occurs, this complication is more likely to be associated with myelodysplastic-myeloproliferative overlap syndromes such as CMML rather than ""dysplasia-only"" MDS types such as refractory anemia. We report a single-institution experience with splenectomy in CMML patients, including a detailed review of splenic histopathology. Twelve patients with CMML underwent splenectomy at the Mayo Clinic, primarily because of refractory thrombocytopenia and/or mechanical complications related to splenomegaly. Three of the 12 patients (25%) died as a direct result of surgery, and significant postoperative morbidity was seen in another 4 patients (33%). Thrombocytopenia improved in 4 of the 11 patients (36%) with low platelet counts before surgery. Three of the four responders had an abundance of CD68 (PGM1)-positive foamy histiocytes in the marginal zone surrounding the splenic white pulp-a pattern which can be seen in immune thrombocytopenia-and two of these three patients had thrombocytopenia out of proportion to the degree of anemia pre-operatively, suggestive of peripheral destruction of platelets. More consistent splenic pathological findings in the 12 patients included trilineage extramedullary hematopoiesis in splenic red pulp and expansion of splenic cords by a myelomonocytic infiltrate. This study underscores both the uniformity and diversity of splenic findings in CMML, highlights the potential dangers and benefits of splenectomy in this group, and suggests peripheral destruction of platelets as a mechanism contributing to thrombocytopenia in a subset of CMML patients.",Journal Article,5986.0,25.0,syndrome chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML includes heterogeneous group patients exhibit myelodysplastic myeloproliferative clinicopathological features Troublesome splenomegaly uncommon myelodysplastic syndrome MDS organomegaly occurs complication likely associated myelodysplastic-myeloproliferative overlap syndromes CMML `` dysplasia-only '' MDS types refractory anemia report single-institution experience splenectomy CMML patients including detailed review splenic histopathology patients CMML underwent splenectomy Mayo Clinic primarily refractory thrombocytopenia and/or mechanical complications related splenomegaly 12 patients 25 died direct surgery significant postoperative morbidity seen 4 patients 33 Thrombocytopenia improved 4 11 patients 36 low platelet counts surgery responders abundance CD68 PGM1 -positive foamy histiocytes marginal zone surrounding splenic white pulp-a pattern seen immune thrombocytopenia-and patients thrombocytopenia proportion degree anemia pre-operatively suggestive peripheral destruction platelets consistent splenic pathological findings 12 patients included trilineage extramedullary hematopoiesis splenic red pulp expansion splenic cords myelomonocytic infiltrate underscores uniformity diversity splenic findings CMML highlights potential dangers benefits splenectomy group suggests peripheral destruction platelets mechanism contributing thrombocytopenia subset CMML patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 681, 1, 442, 5451, 3382, 1920, 8, 1564, 87, 1, 7, 54, 2239, 110, 2, 2721, 404, 22115, 6364, 16, 2052, 4, 681, 1223, 84, 198, 16738, 1780, 26, 1447, 16, 80, 322, 6, 40, 41, 5, 10589, 10857, 4526, 2040, 225, 22, 3382, 1832, 76, 2253, 158, 522, 1223, 630, 225, 22, 430, 1545, 21, 414, 8, 226, 731, 730, 5, 6569, 4, 3382, 7, 141, 8, 2455, 206, 1, 5237, 3831, 2544, 7, 5, 3382, 208, 6569, 28, 3, 2486, 1188, 1561, 408, 1, 430, 1340, 2, 15, 6065, 521, 139, 6, 6364, 169, 1, 3, 133, 7, 243, 1016, 22, 8, 1196, 757, 1, 152, 2, 93, 573, 787, 10, 527, 4, 1809, 39, 7, 466, 1340, 231, 4, 39, 1, 3, 175, 7, 511, 5, 154, 1596, 1911, 348, 152, 169, 1, 3, 294, 1983, 42, 35, 4778, 1, 6439, 53579, 109, 30400, 16734, 4, 3, 3450, 3614, 2976, 3, 5237, 886, 23231, 8, 1177, 92, 122, 40, 527, 4, 250, 1340, 2, 100, 1, 46, 169, 7, 42, 1340, 1205, 1, 920, 6, 3, 1444, 1, 1545, 671, 9433, 3832, 1, 672, 4572, 1, 4407, 80, 925, 5237, 1301, 272, 4, 3, 133, 7, 159, 21950, 5508, 5114, 4, 5237, 3422, 23231, 2, 1422, 1, 5237, 17654, 20, 8, 5451, 5172, 26, 45, 6926, 110, 3, 9338, 2, 3653, 1, 5237, 272, 4, 3382, 2527, 3, 174, 43271, 2, 1141, 1, 6569, 4, 26, 87, 2, 844, 672, 4572, 1, 4407, 22, 8, 670, 3156, 6, 1340, 4, 8, 697, 1, 3382, 7]",1781.0,12804634,Splenic histopathological patterns chronic myelomonocytic leukemia clinical correlations reinforcement heterogeneity syndrome,11,0.019197207678883072

Clin.

Eligible patients were those who were previously untreated and who had either bulky stage II, or stage III or IV lymphoma with working formulation histology D, E, F, G, H, or J; performance status < or = 2; and acceptable end organ function. No upper age limit was specified. Therapy was dose-intensified CHOP (CHOP-DI) with filgrastim support. Each course was repeated every 14 days for six planned courses. Eighty-eight eligible patients were treated with CHOP-DI and had a median follow-up of 5.1 years on this phase II study, designated Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 9349. The progression-free survival was 51% at 2 years and 41% at 5 years. The overall survival was 60% at 5 years. Three fatal treatment-related events occurred.

Conventional adjuvant chemotherapy with or without high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation in high-risk breast cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003-07-01,"The prognosis for women with primary breast cancer and 10 or more involved axillary lymph nodes is poor. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been reported to be effective in the adjuvant setting for patients at high risk for relapse. We randomly assigned 540 female patients with primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes to receive either six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or the same adjuvant chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and thiotepa and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Among the 511 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival, overall survival, or the time to recurrence between those who received CAF alone and those who received CAF plus high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. Among 417 patients fulfilling strict eligibility criteria, the time to recurrence was longer for patients who underwent stem-cell transplantation than for those who received CAF alone. In the transplantation group, nine patients died of transplantation-related complications and a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia developed in nine. The addition of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with CAF may reduce the risk of relapse but does not improve the outcome among patients with primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved axillary lymph nodes.

Phase I study of oral topotecan in hematological malignancies.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2003-09-01,"In this Phase I, dose-seeking study, we investigated the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of oral topotecan in patients with hematological malignancies. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia were treated with 0.6-1.9 mg/m(2)/day oral topotecan for 5 consecutive days on and 2 days off, for 3 weeks (15 doses/course) followed by 2-4 weeks of rest. The DLTs occurring during the first course of treatment were considered for defining the MTD. Preliminary results of antitumor activity were assessed by examining bone marrow status and peripheral blood cell counts. All 26 patients enrolled in the study were evaluable for toxicity, and 24 patients were evaluable for response. A total of 54 courses were administered. The most frequently reported nonhematological toxicities (percentage of courses) were diarrhea (57%), nausea/vomiting (50%), fatigue (24%), and mucositis (9%). DLTs included grade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting and diarrhea at 1.9 mg/m(2)/day. The MTD for oral topotecan in patients with hematological malignancies was defined at 1.4 mg/m(2)/day. Hematological toxicity was noted in all 26 patients and with all courses but was not considered dose-limiting. Four (17%) patients achieved a complete response, and six (25%) patients experienced hematological improvement. Protracted administration of oral topotecan is safe and well tolerated in patients with hematological malignancies.

Fifty-three of 446 patients received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with a median CD3 dose of 1 x 10(7) cells/kg. Their diagnoses included myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 10), acute leukemia (n = 10), chronic leukemia (n = 11), multiple myeloma (n = 9), lymphoma (n = 9), and solid tumors (n = 4). Patients received DLI for persistent disease (n = 8), disease relapse (n = 17), progressive disease (n = 12), low donor chimerism with disease (n = 11), or low chimerism with disease remission (n = 5). Seventeen of the 53 patients (32%) are alive with a median follow-up of 30 months; 5 are in complete remission (CR), 2 are in partial remission (PR), and 10 have stable or progressive disease. Nine of 53 patients (17%) developed grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease. Of 48 patients receiving DLI for treatment of disease, 7 achieved CR and 5 PR, with an overall response rate of 25%.

DNA methylation in haematological malignancies: the role of decitabine.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2003-12-01,"Normal cell development and function is dependent upon controlled gene expression. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can play an important role in the control of gene expression. DNA methylation at cytosine residues in gene promoter CpG sequences is known to inhibit gene transcription. Inappropriate inhibition of the transcription of tumour suppressor genes, genes that inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis and genes involved in DNA repair by uncontrolled methylation, can lead to unregulated growth and proliferation of a cell and carcinogenesis. Promoter hypermethylation affecting the p16 gene, resulting in gene silencing, has been shown to occur in many human solid tumours and a 'hypermethylation profile' in some leukaemias has been defined. The molecular mechanisms by which aberrant DNA methylation takes place during carcinogenesis are still not clear. However, the large number of target genes (involved in tumorigenesis) that are silenced by aberrant methylation suggests that inhibition of this process may have potential as cancer therapy. Decitabine (NSC-127716, Dacogen; SuperGen) is a potent and specific hypomethylating agent and an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase activity that mediates DNA methylation.

Cytogenet.,2004-01-01,"Massive hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes) and tetraploidy (4n) are rare cytogenetic abnormalities in myelocytic malignancies, and their significance is unknown. We report on 11 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and two patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with massive hyperdiploidy (10 patients) or tetraploidy (3 patients) seen at our institution over a 12-year period. Eleven patients were male and two were female. Age range was 44-84 years (median, 70 years). Only one AML patient had a previous MDS, and no patient had therapy-related disease. One or more copies of chromosomes 8 and 19 were gained in eight patients each; other frequently gained chromosomes included 13, 15, and 21. Eight patients had structural abnormalities in addition to chromosome gain; del(5q) was most common (five patients). Eleven patients received induction chemotherapy, but only four achieved complete remission. Survival ranged from 1 to 22 months, with a median of 6 months. We conclude that massive hyperdiploidy and tetraploidy are infrequent abnormalities in AML and MDS, are seen primarily in de novo disease in older male patients and are associated with a low remission rate and short survival.

"RAS, FLT3, and TP53 mutations in therapy-related myeloid malignancies with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7.","Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2004-03-01,"Oncogenic mutations in the KRAS2, NRAS, or FLT3 gene are detected in more than 50% of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RAS mutations are also prevalent in de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. However, few studies have examined these genetic lesions in therapy-related myeloid malignancies. Monosomy 7/del(7q) and monosomy 5/del(5q) represent the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in therapy-related MDS and AML (t-MDS/t-AML) and are strongly associated with prior exposure to alkylating agents. Mutational analysis of bone marrow specimens from a well-characterized cohort of 26 t-MDS/t-AML patients with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 revealed 3 with RAS mutations. Further analyses of 23 of these cases uncovered one FLT3 internal tandem duplication and five TP53 mutations. The four patients with RAS or FLT3 mutations had monosomy 7, including one with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7. One specimen demonstrated mutations in both KRAS2 and TP53.

Amphotericin B lipid complex as prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing induction chemotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2004-02-01,"The optimal antifungal prophylactic regimen for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing induction chemotherapy has yet to be identified. A prospective historical control study evaluated the efficacy and safety of amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) in this patient population. Newly diagnosed patients with AML or high-risk MDS who were undergoing induction chemotherapy received prophylactic ABLC 2.5 mg/kg intravenously 3 times weekly. This treatment group was compared with a historical control group that had similar baseline characteristics and received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) 3 mg/kg 3 times weekly. The primary endpoint was the incidence of documented or suspected fungal infections during and up to 4 weeks after cessation of prophylaxis. Reported adverse events were used to assess tolerability. The overall efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis was similar in patients who received ABLC and patients who received L-AmB (P=0.95). Among 131 ABLC-treated patients and 70 L-AmB-treated patients who were assessed for efficacy and safety, 49% of patients in each group completed therapy without developing a documented or suspected fungal infection. Documented fungal infections occurred in 5% of ABLC-treated patients and in 4% of L-AmB-treated patients. Alternative antifungal strategies were required because of persistent fever or pneumonia of unknown pathogen in 28% and 32% of ABLC-treated and L-AmB-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, therapy discontinuations due to adverse events, and survival rates also were similar between treatment groups.

Expression of constitutively active nuclear-kappa B RelA transcription factor in blasts of acute myeloid leukemia.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2004-02-01,"The nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B regulates cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Little is known about NF-kappa B in myeloid malignancies. In this report, we assessed NF-kappa B in a group of myeloid neoplasms by using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and immunofluorescence methods in freshly isolated leukemia cells. We analyzed 30 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 5 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 3 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 15 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), and 2 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC). Unstimulated cells (bone marrow and peripheral blood) from 17 normal donors and apheresis samples from 6 peripheral blood stem cell donors treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were used as controls. When EMSA was used, NF-kappa B was elevated in 14 of 30 (47%) cases of AML, in both cases of CML-BC, and in all reference donors treated with G-CSF, but it was at basal levels in all cases of MDS and CML-CP and in normal donors (P = <.01).

OSI-211 has significant activity in severe combined immunodeficient mouse models of human leukemia. This study was conducted to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and pharmacokinetics of OSI-211 in patients with refractory myeloid leukemias. Patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) were eligible. OSI-211 was given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 3 days. The starting dose was 1.5 mg/m2 per day (4.5 mg/m2 per course). The dose was escalated by 50% until Grade 2 toxicity was observed and then by 30-35% until the DLT was defined. Serial plasma and urine samples were collected, and drug levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Twenty patients (18 patients [90%] with AML, and 1 patient each [5%] with MDS and CML-BP) were treated. Mucositis and diarrhea were considered to be the DLTs. The maximum tolerated dose was 3.7 mg/m2 per day. Fourteen of 18 evaluable patients (78%) with AML or MDS achieved transient bone marrow aplasia. The mean systemic clearance of lurtotecan in plasma was 0.946 +/- 1.53 L/hour/m2. Urinary recovery of lurtotecan was 6.66% +/- 5.26% (range, 1.05-18.4%).

"Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, and not receptor 2, is an independent prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.",Cancer,Cancer,2004-05-01,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) are major regulators of angiogenesis, which plays a key role in the growth and dissemination of solid tumors and hematologic neoplasms. The authors measured the plasma concentrations of soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) and sVEGFR2 in 133 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in 80 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) at the time of initial presentation and compared clinical behaviors. A reverse correlation was observed between plasma sVEGFR1 levels and the rate of complete remission (CR) in patients with AML, but not in patients with MDS. In contrast, increased plasma levels of sVEGFR2 were correlated with a lower CR rate in patients with MDS, but not in patients with AML. Cox regression model analysis demonstrated that plasma levels of sVEGFR1, but not sVEGFR2, were independent prognostic factors in both patients with AML and patients with MDS.

Cancer Res.,2004-05-01,"VNP40101M is a novel sulfonylhydrazine alkylating agent with broad antitumor activity in animal models. As alkylating agents are important antileukemia drugs, a Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of VNP40101M was conducted in patients with refractory or relapsed leukemias or poor-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). VNP40101M was given as a single i.v. infusion over 15-70 min on day 1. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks according to antileukemic activity. The starting dose of 220 mg/m(2) was escalated by approximately 33% in cohorts of 3-6 patients until a maximum-tolerated dose was established. One additional cohort was treated with the maximum-tolerated dose divided over days 1 and 8. Thirty-eight patients, including 28 with acute myeloid leukemia and 5 with MDS, received 52 courses of treatment. Nondose-limiting, reversible infusion-related toxicities were the most frequent adverse event, occurring in 24 (63%) patients on the first course. Dose escalation was terminated at 708 mg/m(2) for prolonged myelosuppression in 1 of 7 patients, and 600 mg/m(2) was selected as the recommended Phase II dose, with no significant extramedullary toxicity at this dose level. Two patients, 1 with MDS treated with 300 mg/m(2) and 1 with acute myeloid leukemia treated with 600 mg/m(2), achieved complete remission.

Management of thalidomide toxicity.,The journal of supportive oncology,J Support Oncol,,"Thalidomide has re-emerged as a novel antineoplastic agent with immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic activities. In the early sixties, it was withdrawn from the market after its infamous association with congenital abnormalities that left about 10,000 children affected world-wide. With strict regulations and precautions, thalidomide is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum. Its role in cancer therapy is promising, with clinical trials in the past 5 years showing significant activity in multiple myeloma. Several trials are ongoing in other malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. The major toxicities of thalidomide are birth defects, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, somnolence, rash, fatigue, and constipation. Less common side effects include deep venous thrombosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, malaise, and peripheral edema. The incidence and severity of adverse events are related to dose and duration of therapy. Doses of the drug of 200 mg/day or less are usually well tolerated.

Acquired alpha-thalassemia in association with myelodysplastic syndrome and other hematologic malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2004-09-09,"Abnormalities of hemoglobin synthesis are usually inherited but may also arise as a secondary manifestation of another disease, most commonly hematologic neoplasia. Acquired hemoglobin disorders can be seen in any population and are not restricted to areas of the world with high incidences of inherited hemoglobinopathies. In fact, the acquired hemoglobinopathies may be more readily recognized where inherited hemoglobin abnormalities are rare and less likely to cause diagnostic confusion. Acquired alpha-thalassemia is the best characterized of the acquired red blood cell disorders in patients with hematologic malignancy, and it is almost always associated with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At least 2 molecular mechanisms for acquired alpha-thalassemia are now recognized: acquired deletion of the alpha-globin gene cluster limited to the neoplastic clone and, more commonly, inactivating somatic mutations of the trans-acting chromatin-associated factor ATRX, which cause dramatic down-regulation of alpha-globin gene expression.

Results of a phase 1-2 study of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine (ara-C) in relapsed and refractory acute leukemias.,Blood,Blood,2004-10-14,"Clofarabine (2-chloro-2'-fluoro-deoxy-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is a second-generation nucleoside analog with activity in acute leukemias. As clofarabine is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RnR), we hypothesized that clofarabine will modulate ara-c triphosphate accumulation and increase the antileukemic activity of cytarabine (ara-C). We conducted a phase 1-2 study of clofarabine plus ara-C in 32 patients with relapsed acute leukemia (25 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 4 high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 1 blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).(1) Clofarabine was given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 2 through 6) followed 4 hours later by ara-C at 1 g/m(2) per day as a 2-hour intravenous infusion for 5 days (days 1 through 5). The phase 2 dose of clofarabine was 40 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days. Among all patients, 7 (22%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 5 (16%) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 38%. No responses occurred in 3 patients with ALL and CML. One patient (3%) died during induction. Adverse events were mainly less than or equal to grade 2, including transient liver test abnormalities, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, mucositis, and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesias.

Platelet kinetics and decreased transfusion requirements after splenectomy for hematologic malignancy.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2004-11-01,"Thrombocytopenia is a significant and morbid problem in patients with hematologic malignancy, resulting in frequent platelet transfusions and significant resource consumption. We undertook this study to determine the impact of splenectomy on transfusion requirements in patients with chronic leukemia, acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and lymphoma. Records of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent splenectomy were reviewed. Results are reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean. Mean preoperative (preop) platelet count was 97 +/- 8 K/microL. A significant rise in platelets, compared with preop, was observed starting on postsplenectomy day 1 (141 +/- 8 K/microL, P < 0.001 versus preop) and persisted through day 7. Counts remained significantly elevated at 3 and 6 months and years 1-5. In profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (preop levels < 20 K/microL), preop count was 11 +/- 1 K/microL. A significant postsplenectomy platelet rise persisted for at least 1 year (137 +/- 52 K/microL, P < 0.05 versus preop). An increased platelet level was observed in all hematologic subgroups; in the chronic leukemias (n = 58, P < 0.01) and in lymphoma (n = 59, P < 0.001), this reached significance. Mean platelet transfusions were significantly decreased from preop (3 months preop: 8.6 +/- 2 units) compared with postsplenectomy (3 months postsplenectomy: 5.0 +/- 1 unit, P = 0.03). This decrease was even more pronounced in profoundly thrombocytopenic patients (31.6 +/- 10.6 units preop versus 8.9 +/- 4.8 units postoperative, P = 0.01). In the hematologic malignancies, splenectomy produces a significant and longlasting restoration of platelet levels and a resultant decrease in platelet transfusion requirements.

Management of patients with systemic mastocytosis: review of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center experience.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2004-11-01,"Mastocytosis is characterized by mast cell proliferation that may be limited to the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or may involve one or more extracutaneous organs, e.g., the bone marrow (systemic mastocytosis; SM). This study objective is to evaluate the features and outcome of patients referred to M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) with SM. A search of the MDACC database from 1944 to 2002 was conducted for patients with SM and review of their clinical charts. Eighteen patients with mastocytosis were identified in the MDACC database; 15 (11 males and 4 females) had SM and available information. Two had associated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and one had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The median age was 58 years (range 31-80). Nine patients were treated with subcutaneous interferon-alpha, and only 1 experienced temporary control of the disease. Three of these patients were then treated with imatinib mesylate: transient improvement was noted in two patients. One patient underwent stem cell transplantation as first therapy and achieved complete remission; this patient had associated MDS and is now in complete remission for 8 years. The patient with associated AML was treated with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin; he has been in complete remission for 16 months. One patient was treated with induction chemotherapy consisting of high-dose cytarabine and 2CDA but expired due to sepsis. Three patients received symptomatic therapy only; these were the only 3 patients who presented with normal blood counts. SM is rare and has no effective standard of care.

Childhood and adolescent lymphoid and myeloid leukemia.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2004-01-01,"Remarkable progress has been made in the past decade in the treatment and in the understanding of the biology of childhood lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. With contemporary improved risk assessment, chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and supportive care, approximately 80% of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 50% of those with myeloid neoplasm can be cured to date. Current emphasis is placed not only on increased cure rate but also on improved quality of life. In Section I, Dr. Ching-Hon Pui describes certain clinical and biologic features that still have prognostic and therapeutic relevance in the context of contemporary treatment programs. He emphasizes that treatment failure in some patients is not due to intrinsic drug resistance of leukemic cells but is rather caused by suboptimal drug dosing due to host compliance, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics. Hence, measurement of minimal residual disease, which accounts for both the genetic (primary and secondary) features of leukemic lymphoblasts and pharmacogenomic variables of the host, is the most reliable prognostic indicator. Finally, he contends that with optimal risk-directed systemic and intrathecal therapy, cranial irradiation may be omitted in all patients, regardless of the presenting features. In Section II, Dr. Martin Schrappe performs detailed analyses of the prognostic impact of presenting age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype, genetic abnormality, early treatment response, and in vitro drug sensitivity/resistance in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on the large database of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster consortium. He also succinctly summarizes the important treatment components resulting in the improved outcome of children and young adolescents with this disease. He describes the treatment approach that led to the improved outcome of adolescent patients, a finding that may be applied to young adults in the second and third decade of life. Finally, he believes that treatment reduction under well-controlled clinical trials is feasible in a subgroup of patients with excellent early treatment response as evidenced by minimal residual disease measurement during induction and consolidation therapy. In Section III, Dr. Raul Ribeiro describes distinct morphologic and genetic subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. The finding of essentially identical gene expression profiling by DNA microarray in certain specific genetic subtypes of childhood and adult acute myeloid leukemia suggests a shared leukemogenesis. He then describes the principles of treatment as well as the efficacy and toxicity of various forms of postremission therapy, emphasizing the need of tailoring therapy to both the disease and the age of the patient. Early results suggest that minimal residual disease measurement can also improve the risk assessment in acute myeloid leukemia, and that cranial irradiation can be omitted even in those with central-nervous-system leukemia at diagnosis. In Section IV, Dr. Charlotte Niemeyer describes a new classification of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases in childhood, which has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recent discovery of somatic mutations in PTPN11 has improved the understanding of the pathobiology and the diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Together with the findings of mutations in RAS and NF1 in the other patients, she suggests that pathological activation of RAS-dependent pathways plays a central role in the leukemogenesis of this disease. She then describes the various treatment approaches for both juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in the US and Europe, emphasizing the differences between childhood and adult cases for the latter group of diseases. She also raises some controversial issues regarding treatment that will require well-controlled international clinical trials to address.",Journal Article,5864.0,115.0,Remarkable progress past decade

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2005-02-01,"Allogeneic progenitor cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. To identify prognostic factors in these patients, we performed a retrospective analysis of transplantation outcomes. Patients were selected if they had undergone an allogeneic transplantation between January 1988 and January 2002 and were not in remission or first untreated relapse at the time of transplantation. A total of 135 patients were identified. The median age was 49.5 years (range, 19-75 years). At the time of transplantation, 39.3% of patients had not responded to induction therapy, 37% had not responded to first salvage therapy, and 23.7% were beyond first salvage. Forty-one patients (30%) received unrelated donor progenitor cells. Eighty patients (59%) received either a reduced-intensity or a nonmyeloablative regimen. A total of 104 (77%) of 135 patients died, with a median survival time of 4.9 months (95% confidence interval, 3.9-6.6 months). The median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-4.2 months). A Cox regression analysis showed that Karnofsky performance status, peripheral blood blasts, and tacrolimus exposure during the first 11 days after transplantation were predictive of survival.

Cytoprotection in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) therapy.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2004-12-01,"Planning therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is difficult because of the heterogeneous nature of the disease and varying patient age at presentation. Cytogenetics and patient age at the time of diagnosis are two major factors determining treatment outcome in AML. Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics have much lower complete remission rates than other groups. In addition, AML in patients greater than 55 to 60 years of age often exhibits a resistant phenotype, more akin to secondary AML or AML arising from myelodysplastic syndromes. This group is also characterized by lower complete remission rates, and often requires the delivery of intensive therapy to a patient population that is the least likely to tolerate it. At the Jefferson Health System (Philadelphia, PA), we wished to develop a regimen that was maximally intensive to treat stubborn disease, but gentle enough to be given to all patients regardless of age. Toward this end, 33 patients received a maximal dose of the cytoprotective agent, amifostine, before each infusion of idarubicin in the ""7 + 3"" regimen, escalating the dose of idarubicin in a phase I fashion to a maximum dose of 24 mg/m2 . The data indicate that the addition of amifostine to ""7 + 3"" AML induction therapy enables a substantial escalation of the idarubicin dose through the 21-mg/m2 dose level, without a concomitant increase in side effects, thus providing a regimen that is both intensive and applicable to patients of all ages.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-02-22,"To investigate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-214662, a farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor, in patients with acute leukemias and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias or MDS, or previously untreated but poor candidates for chemotherapy, were included in this phase I study with a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. BMS-214662 was administered as a 1-hour bolus once weekly at doses of 42 to 157 mg/m2. Once the MTD was identified, the schedule was changed to a 24-hour continuous infusion once weekly (starting dose, 300 mg/m2). Thirty patients were treated at a dose of 42 (n = 1), 56 (n = 3), 84 (n = 3), 118 (n = 13), 157 (n = 6) or 300 mg/m2 (n = 4). DLT occurred in 3 patients at 157 mg/m2, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypokalemia and cardiovascular problems. No DLT occurred with 24-hour continuous infusion. MTD with a 1-hour infusion was 118 mg/m2, with no MTD identified with the 24-hour infusion. Plasma concentrations of BMS-214662 correlated with the dose. Inhibition of FTase activity of approximately 60% occurred after the infusion with recovery to near baseline after 24 hours.

The treatment of choice, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, provides the only known cure for the disease, but relapse after transplant is common. The authors describe a 5-year-old boy diagnosed at age 34 months with JMML that evolved to acute myeloid leukemia. Initial treatment consisted of fludarabine and cis-retinoic acid therapy, followed by a matched sibling bone marrow transplant. After a relapse, he received a second transplant from the same donor, using peripheral blood stem cells, followed by repeated donor leukocyte infusions. After the second relapse, he received the farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra), but the leukemia persisted. When bone marrow blasts numbered 60% of the mononuclear cells, he received single-agent clofarabine induction (52 mg/m/d) for 5 days.

Increasing incidence of late second malignancies after conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation and autologous bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-03-07,"Although the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been well-described following autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), the risk of solid tumors has been poorly characterized. We report the incidence and outcome of solid tumors at 10-year follow-up in a large cohort of uniformly treated patients who underwent ABMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Between 1982 and 1997, 605 patients underwent ABMT for B-cell NHL, with uniform conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow purged with anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies. Current information on relapse of disease and second malignancies was obtained via an institutional review board-approved questionnaire sent to the referring oncologists. Forty-two solid tumors, six non-MDS hematologic malignancies, 39 nonmelanoma skin cancers, and 68 cases of MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were observed at a median follow-up of 9.5 years. A cumulative incidence model using death as a competing risk found that the 10-year incidence of second malignancy is 21%, with 10.0% non-MDS malignancies. The projected incidence of all malignancies at 15 years is 29%. The principal risk factor for second malignancy is increased age at ABMT (P = .0002). In the entire cohort, 9.6% of patients have died of second malignancy. Lengthy follow-up demonstrates a significant incidence of second malignancies after ABMT for NHL.

Expression of DLK1 in hematopoietic cells results in inhibition of differentiation and proliferation.,Oncogene,Oncogene,2005-06-01,"The Delta-like (DLK1) gene is overexpressed in CD34+ cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. DLK1 encodes an EGF-like homeotic transmembrane protein homologous to the notch/delta/serrate family. Although exogenous DLK1 promotes maintenance of murine hematopoietic stem cells, the functional effects of DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells are unknown. We show that ectopically expressed DLK1 significantly inhibits differentiation and proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Unlike preadipocytes, where proteolytic processing of membrane-bound protein and release of a soluble form mediates differentiation inhibition, proteolytic release of the extracellular domain was not required for inhibition of hematopoietic cell differentiation. However, intracellular domain interactions were critical to this DLK1 function. We conclude that DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells has important functional consequences. Our studies identify novel molecular mechanisms and indicate that DLK1 has activity both as a soluble and a transmembrane expressed protein.

Adaptive randomized study of idarubicin and cytarabine alone or with interleukin-11 as induction therapy in patients aged 50 or above with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2005-04-01,"A higher complete remission (CR) rate was observed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who, on a prior randomized study of induction therapy, received gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) plus interleukin-11 (IL-11) rather than GO alone. An adaptive randomized phase III study of the addition of IL-11 to idarubicin and cytarabine (IA) induction in 100 patients >/=50 years of age with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was conducted. Median patient age was 67 years (range 50-82). Twenty-four of the 45 (53%) patients randomized to IA plus IL-11 achieved CR. Eight (33%) subsequently relapsed, 4 (17%) died in CR; median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 37 weeks. Twenty-nine of the 55 (53%) patients treated without IL-11 achieved CR. Eight (28%) subsequently relapsed, 2 (7%) died in CR; median TTF was 46 weeks. Median overall survivals were 21 and 59 weeks for the IA plus IL-11 and IA cohorts, respectively (p=0.271, log rank test; 0.435, Gehan-Breslow test).

Myelodysplasic syndromes: a comprehensive review.,Blood reviews,Blood Rev.,2005-11-01,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a set of oligoclonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that manifest clinically as anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia of variable severity. The result often is transfusion-dependent anemia, an increased risk of infection or hemorrhage, and a potential to progress to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although progression to acute leukemia can lead to death in patients with MDS, many deaths are consequences of cytopenias and marrow failure in the absence of transformation. Approximately 2/3 of patients succumb to the disease within 3-4 years after presentation, and individuals with high-risk MDS generally survive about 1 year. Given that the disease is more prevalent in the elderly who often have comorbid conditions, the current treatment of MDS consists mainly of supportive care. Curative treatments are restricted to younger, healthy individuals with histocompatible (HLA)-matched donors for allogenic transplant or those able to undergo intensive chemotherapeutic regimens. However, understanding of the pathophysiology of MDS and identification of potential cellular and molecular targets in recent years has led to novel therapeutic approaches. Encouraging results using these heterogeneous therapeutic approaches alone or in combination in Phase I and II trials, have, in turn, called into question previous classification systems and have confirmed the need for an all-encompassing molecular, diagnostic and prognostic staging system.",Journal Article,5194.0,71.0,Myelodysplastic syndromes MDS set oligoclonal disorders hematopoietic stem characterized ineffective hematopoiesis manifest clinically anemia neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia variable severity transfusion-dependent anemia increased risk infection hemorrhage potential progress acute myelogenous leukemia AML progression acute leukemia lead death patients MDS deaths consequences cytopenias marrow failure absence transformation Approximately 2/3 patients succumb disease 3-4 years presentation individuals high-risk MDS generally survive 1 year Given disease prevalent elderly comorbid conditions current treatment MDS consists mainly supportive care Curative treatments restricted younger healthy individuals histocompatible HLA -matched donors allogenic transplant able undergo intensive chemotherapeutic regimens understanding pathophysiology MDS identification potential cellular molecular targets recent years led novel therapeutic approaches Encouraging heterogeneous therapeutic approaches combination Phase II trials turn called question previous classification systems confirmed need all-encompassing molecular diagnostic prognostic staging,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2040, 1223, 32, 8, 916, 1, 18201, 1997, 1, 1007, 452, 37, 765, 20, 3957, 5114, 17, 7633, 505, 22, 1545, 778, 2, 15, 1340, 1, 1347, 1702, 3, 757, 629, 16, 2785, 470, 1545, 35, 101, 43, 1, 930, 15, 3599, 2, 8, 174, 6, 1466, 6, 286, 2194, 329, 242, 91, 6, 286, 122, 1122, 6, 273, 4, 7, 5, 1223, 445, 1043, 32, 3255, 1, 5635, 2, 581, 496, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 1392, 705, 18, 27, 1, 7, 9025, 6, 3, 34, 262, 27, 39, 60, 50, 1031, 2, 869, 5, 64, 43, 1223, 1228, 4573, 545, 14, 111, 447, 17, 3, 34, 16, 80, 2485, 4, 3, 1216, 54, 629, 47, 3952, 1298, 3, 291, 24, 1, 1223, 5132, 2615, 1, 1877, 165, 1075, 640, 32, 2016, 6, 773, 1331, 869, 5, 30254, 1160, 655, 2344, 9, 15122, 941, 15, 135, 1665, 6, 1251, 1686, 1573, 472, 137, 612, 1, 3, 4320, 1, 1223, 2, 911, 1, 174, 763, 2, 219, 637, 4, 435, 60, 71, 836, 6, 229, 189, 611, 2269, 99, 75, 46, 1564, 189, 611, 279, 15, 4, 150, 4, 124, 70, 2, 215, 143, 47, 4, 3854, 3472, 237, 2840, 698, 947, 1530, 2, 47, 557, 3, 594, 9, 35, 62, 6853, 219, 752, 2, 177, 632, 398]",1483.0,15885860,Myelodysplasic syndromes comprehensive review,216,0.3769633507853403
Durable molecular remissions with a single cycle of timed sequential consolidation chemotherapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2005-06-01,"In a pilot study to reduce the duration of treatment and potential long-term toxicities, 39 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia in remission received a single cycle of intensive consolidation therapy, followed by intermittent ATRA maintenance. Consolidation therapy required prolonged hospitalization and was associated with a high incidence of mucositis (43% grade II or greater) and documented infection (45%). No deaths occurred during consolidation. Seven patients have relapsed; all other patients are in molecular remission (median follow-up, 2.75 years). Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3 year disease-free survival is 73% (95% confidence interval 55-91%). The relapse rate (0.06 relapses/patient-year of follow-up) is well within the range of larger published series that administer more prolonged consolidation. One patient has developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. These pilot data suggest that decreasing the total duration of consolidation chemotherapy did not compromise disease-free survival for APL patients induced with ATRA/anthracycline and given intermittent ATRA maintenance.

Adult acute megakaryocytic leukemia: an analysis of 37 patients treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.,Blood,Blood,2005-08-25,"To characterize acute megakaryocytic leukemia (FAB M7 AML), we identified 37 patients with M7 AML treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1987 and 2003 and compared them with 1800 patients with non-M7, non-M3 AML treated during the same period. The median age of the M7 AML group was 56 years (range, 21-78 years); 22 patients (59%) had an antecedent hematologic disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome or both, and 7 patients (19%) had previously received chemotherapy for other malignancies. Extensive bone marrow fibrosis was found in 23 patients (62%). Poor cytogenetic characteristics were observed in 49% of patients with M7 AML versus 33% of others (P < .001). Complete remission rates were 43% with M7 AML and 57% with non-M7 AML (P = .089). Median overall survival (OS) was 23 and 38 weeks, respectively (P = .006). Median disease-free survivals were 23 versus 52 weeks, respectively (P < .001). By multivariate analysis, M7 AML was an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS, independent of other factors including cytogenetic abnormalities (hazard ratio 1.51, P = .049).

Cancer Res.,2005-09-01,"ABT-751 is an oral antimitotic agent that binds to the colchicine site on beta-tubulin. A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of ABT-751 in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. Thirty-two patients were treated: nine with 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 3), or 150 mg/m(2) (n = 3) of ABT-751 given orally once daily for 7 days every 3 weeks and 23 with 75 (n = 3), 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 5), 150 (n = 5), 175 (n = 3), or 200 mg/m(2) (n = 4) of ABT-751 given orally once daily for 21 days every 4 weeks. Consenting patients had pharmacogenetic sampling and enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of ileus in one patient at 200 mg/m(2), with a subsequent patient developing grade 2 constipation at the same dose level. One patient with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia achieved a complete remission that was sustained for 2 months. Four other patients had transient hematologic improvements, consisting of a decrease in peripheral blood blasts and improvements in platelet counts. CEC number was reduced in three patients with a concomitant reduction in peripheral blasts.

Combination therapy with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in hematologic malignancies.,Nature clinical practice. Oncology,Nat Clin Pract Oncol,2005-12-01,"A variety of epigenetic changes contribute to transcriptional dysregulation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors--azacitidine and decitabine--have significant activity in the treatment of MDS. Despite marked activity in myeloid malignancy, monotherapy with DNMT inhibitors is limited by low complete and partial response rates (7-20%) and median response durations of 15 months. As with classical cytotoxic therapy, the targeting of biologic pathways and mechanisms may best be accomplished using a combination of agents offering complementary mechanisms and synergistic pharmacodynamic interactions. The goal of this approach is to improve response rates, quality, and duration, and to minimize adverse events. There are a number of new therapies under development for the management of MDS and AML. This review article touches on some of the more promising combination regimens in various phases of investigation. The treatment of MDS and AML is undergoing rapid evolution. Cytogenetic complete remission and prolonged survival represent important goals. Incremental improvements in disease state and quality-of-life issues are also important for patients. Given the overall failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the achievement of cures in MDS and MDS-related AML, the application of less toxic, biologically directed agents may represent a more promising approach to treatment.

Duration of prophylaxis (median, 21 days [range, 1 to 38 days]), demographics, and prognostic factors were similar in both groups. Ninety-nine patients completed antifungal prophylaxis without developing fungal infection (44 [51%] with itraconazole, 55 [52%] with caspofungin). Twelve patients developed documented invasive fungal infections, five in the itraconazole group (four with candidemia and one with Aspergillus pneumonia), and seven in the caspofungin group (two with candidemia, two with disseminated trichosporon species, two with Aspergillus pneumonia, and one with disseminated Fusarium spp).

Current therapeutic uses of lenalidomide in multiple myeloma.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2006-02-01,"Thalidomide has demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological and immunological effects, with potential therapeutic applications that span a wide spectrum of diseases: cancer and related conditions; infectious diseases; autoimmune diseases; dermatological diseases; and other disorders such as sarcoidosis, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Immunomodulatory derivative lenalidomide has more potent antitumour and anti-inflammatory effects. The molecular mechanisms of antitumour activity of lenalidomide have been extensively studied in multiple myeloma (MM). It directly induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis of even drug-resistant MM cells; inhibits binding of MM cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix proteins and stromal cells; modulates cytokine secretion and inhibits angiogenesis in the bone marrow milieu; and augments host antitumour immunity. Importantly, lenalidomide induces significant clinical responses even in patients with relapsed/refractory MM.

Results of intensive chemotherapy in 998 patients age 65 years or older with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome: predictive prognostic models for outcome.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-03-01,"Elderly patients (age > or = 65 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally have a poor prognosis. AML-type therapy results are often derived from studies in younger patients and may not apply to elderly AML. Many investigators and oncologists advocate, at times, only supportive care or frontline single agents, Phase I-II studies, low-intensity regimens, or 'targeted' therapies. However, baseline expectations for outcomes of elderly AML with 'standard' AML-type therapy are not well defined. The aim was to develop prognostic models for complete response (CR), induction (8-week) mortality, and survival rates in elderly AML, which would be used to advise oncologists and patients of expectations with standard AML type therapy, and to establish baseline therapy results against which novel strategies would be evaluated. A total of 998 patients age > or = 65 years with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (> 10% blasts) treated with intensive chemotherapy between 1980 and 2004 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors associated with CR, induction (8-week) mortality, and survival used standard methods. The overall CR rate was 45% and induction mortality 29%. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors identified consistent independent poor prognostic factors for CR, 8-week mortality, and survival. These included age > or = 75 years, unfavorable karyotypes (often complex), poor performance (3-4 ECOG [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group]), longer duration of antecedent hematologic disorder, treatment outside the laminar airflow room, and abnormal organ functions.

"Are myelodysplastic syndromes ""cancer""? Unexpected adverse consequences of linguistic ambiguity.",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2006-01-26,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal, neoplastic disorders of hematopoietic tissue that convey a guarded prognosis, but physicians vary in whether they refer to MDS as a ""cancer"" when discussing the diagnosis with patients. Because of past ambiguity about whether MDS is truly a malignancy, confusion about MDS terminology is widespread. Additionally, patients who carry one of the dubious cancer-specific health insurance policies are usually not eligible for financial benefits when they receive a diagnosis of MDS. Likewise, patients with MDS who have been led to believe they do not have a form of cancer by their primary physician may become upset when seeing another health care provider who does refer to MDS in this way.

Myelodysplasia: when to treat and how.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2006-01-01,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. The result is pancytopenia leading to transfusion-dependent anemia, an increased risk of infection or bleeding, and a potential to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS is most prevalent among older individuals, many of whom also suffer from other medical conditions. MDS is classified according to World Health Organization criteria and the International Prognostic Scoring System. Supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. Those with low-risk MDS can often be monitored for an extended period of time without specific therapy, whereas those with intermediate- or high-risk MDS benefit from treatment. Currently, only azacitidine is approved for the treatment of MDS. Several new agents are being tested, including inhibitors of angiogenesis (thalidomide, lenalidomide), farnesyl transferase inhibitors (lonafarnib, tipifarnib), and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine, decitabine). Lenalidomide appears particularly effective in patients with low-risk MDS with the deletion of chromosome 5q31. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an alternative for high-risk MDS. With advances in transplantation techniques, this treatment can be offered to an increasing number of patients.

Decitabine indirectly depletes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of target gene promoters. A total of 170 patients with MDS were randomized to receive either decitabine at a dose of 15 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days (at a dose of 135 mg/m2 per course) and repeated every 6 weeks, or best supportive care. Response was assessed using the International Working Group criteria and required that response criteria be met for at least 8 weeks. Patients who were treated with decitabine achieved a significantly higher overall response rate (17%), including 9% complete responses, compared with supportive care (0%) (P < .001). An additional 12 patients who were treated with decitabine (13%) achieved hematologic improvement. Responses were durable (median, 10.3 mos) and were associated with transfusion independence. Patients treated with decitabine had a trend toward a longer median time to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) progression or death compared with patients who received supportive care alone (all patients, 12.1 mos vs. 7.8 mos [P = 0.16]; those with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high-risk disease, 12.0 mos vs. 6.8 mos [P = 0.03]; those with de novo disease, 12.6 mos vs. 9.4 mos [P = 0.04]; and treatment-naive patients, 12.3 mos vs. 7.3 mos [P = 0.08]).

Allogeneic transplantation for the elderly patient with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2006-04-01,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are diseases of the elderly. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers the possibility of cure for these malignancies, but until recently its use was restricted to younger patients due to prohibitive treatment-related mortality. Improvements in supportive care and development of reduced-intensity preparative regimens have allowed patients in the sixth, seventh, and to a lesser extent, eighth decade of life to be treated with allogeneic transplantation. Major obstacles to extending this form of treatment to older patients are lack of promptly available donors, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), delayed immune recovery, and the high prevalence of refractory and relapsed disease intrinsic to the natural history of these myeloid malignancies.

Recombinant interferon gamma1b immune enhancement in 20 patients with hematologic malignancies and systemic opportunistic infections treated with donor granulocyte transfusions.,Cancer,Cancer,2006-06-01,"The response to antifungal therapy alone often is suboptimal in patients with cancer who have therapy-refractory neutropenia, and even donor-derived granulocyte transfusions (GTX) are not always successful. The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of immune enhancement using recombinant interferon gamma1b (rIFN-gamma1b) in patients with cancer who received GTX for refractory, systemic, opportunistic infections. Twenty recipients of high-dose donor GTX ( approximately 5.5 x 10(10) neutrophils per transfusion) who had received concurrent rIFN-gamma1b between October 2001 and December 2004 were evaluated retrospectively. The median age (+/- standard deviation [SD]) was 45 +/- 17 years. Ten patients (50%) were men, 17 patients (85%) had leukemia, and 3 patients (15%) had myelodysplastic syndrome. The median +/- SD Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 15 +/- 4 (range, 7-22). Most patients (n = 18 patients; 90%) had recurrent or refractory cancer. In 6 patients (30%) who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b was given a median +/- SD of 26 +/- 100 days (range, 12-372 days) after transplantation. Seventeen patients (85%) had neutropenia during GTX therapy. Five patients (25%) had possible invasive fungal infection, 3 patients (15%) had probable invasive fungal infection, and 11 patients (55%) had proven invasive fungal infection. One patient (5%) had refractory Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. Eight patients (40%) received corticosteroids during GTX plus rIFN-gamma1b therapy. Patients received a median +/- SD of 8 +/- 7 GTX doses (range, 4-28 doses) and 9 +/- 7 rIFN-gamma1b doses (range, 1-28 doses), for a mean +/- SD cumulative dose (CD) of 400 +/- 2621 microg. Other concomitant cytokines were granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 3 doses; CD, 6720 +/- 4721 microg) in 15 patients (75%) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (12 +/- 9 doses; CD, 4750 +/- 4410 microg) in 14 patients (70%). Four patients (20%) developed fever, and 2 patients (10%) developed skin rashes. Reversible liver dysfunction (n = 3 patients; 15%) and tachycardia (n = 1 patients; 5%) were considered rIFN-gamma1b-associated adverse reactions; whereas, in 1 patient (5%), transient dyspnea was attributed to GTX. Four weeks after therapy started, 9 patients (45%) had complete or partial resolution of infection; and, in another 3 patients (15%), the invasive fungal infection had become stable.

"SALL4, a novel oncogene, is constitutively expressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and induces AML in transgenic mice.",Blood,Blood,2006-06-08,"SALL4, a human homolog to Drosophila spalt, is a novel zinc finger transcriptional factor essential for development. We cloned SALL4 and its isoforms (SALL4A and SALL4B). Through immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that SALL4 was constitutively expressed in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 81), and directly tested the leukemogenic potential of constitutive expression of SALL4 in a murine model. SALL4B transgenic mice developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like features and subsequently AML that was transplantable. Increased apoptosis associated with dysmyelopoiesis was evident in transgenic mouse marrow and colony-formation (CFU) assays. Both isoforms could bind to beta-catenin and synergistically enhanced the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our data suggest that the constitutive expression of SALL4 causes MDS/AML, most likely through the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

Combined DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibition in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2006-06-01,"Optimal reexpression of most genes silenced through promoter methylation requires the sequential application of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors in tumor cell cultures. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacitidine (aza-CR) followed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium phenylbutyrate. Major responses associated with cytogenetic complete response developed in patients receiving prolonged dosing schedules of aza-CR. Bisulfite sequencing of the p15 promoter in marrow DNA during the first cycle of treatment showed heterogeneous allelic demethylation in three responding patients, suggesting ongoing demethylation within the tumor clone, but no demethylation in two nonresponders. Six of six responding patients with pretreatment methylation of p15 or CDH-1 promoters reversed methylation during the first cycle of therapy (methylation-specific PCR), whereas none of six nonresponders showed any demethylation.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: WHO defined.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2006-01-01,"The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid disorders has provided updated parameters for the consistent diagnosis of two previously less than optimally defined chronic myeloid disorders, CNL and CMML. The classification of these disorders, which had been controversial, is now better defined and provides more clinically and biologically relevant disease definitions to enable uniform diagnosis and a framework to evaluate natural history and therapeutic interventions. CNL is now recognized as a distinct entity among the chronic myeloproliferative disorders and CMML is included within the new category of 'myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases' (MDS/MPD). Predominant neutrophilia defines CNL whereas CMML is defined by predominant and monocytosis. In each case these defining features must be distinguished from reactive causes for the same in the absence of clear evidence of myeloid clonality (CNL and CMML) or dysplasia (CMML). The exclusion of underlying bcr/abl-driven oncogenesis is an essential component in the diagnosis of these chronic leukemic processes. The optimal therapy for both CNL and CMML remains uncertain. Current management decisions are based on small studies or extrapolated from therapeutic strategies that are effective in similar chronic, clonal myeloid disorders.

Arsenic derivatives in hematologic malignancies: a role beyond acute promyelocytic leukemia?,Hematological oncology,Hematol Oncol,2006-12-01,"The importance of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been underscored over the last decade due to its efficacy against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a disease in which this agent has been associated with complete hematologic and molecular remission rates of 87% and 83%, respectively.

However, responses obtained thus far have consisted of improvements in signs and symptoms without the elimination of a given disease. Toxicities derived from As2O3 are significant but manageable and reversible. However, the risk/benefit ratio of As2O3 in hematologic malignancies other than APL is still unclear.

Cancer Res.,2006-08-01,"LBH589 is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cell lines. In this phase I study, LBH589 was administered i.v. as a 30-minute infusion on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle. Fifteen patients (median age, 63 years; range, 42-87 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (13 patients), acute lymphocytic leukemia (1 patient), or myelodysplastic syndrome (1 patient) were treated with LBH589 at the following dose levels (mg/m(2)): 4.8 (3 patients), 7.2 (3 patients), 9.0 (1 patient), 11.5 (3 patient), and 14.0 (5 patients). The levels of histone acetylation were measured using quantitative flow cytometry and plasma LBH589 concentrations were assayed. Four dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 QTcF prolongation) were observed, four at 14.0 mg/m(2) and one at 11.5 mg/m(2). QTcF prolongation was asymptomatic and reversed on LBH589 discontinuation. Other potentially LBH589-related toxicities included nausea (40%), diarrhea (33%), vomiting (33%), hypokalemia (27%), loss of appetite (13%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). In 8 of 11 patients with peripheral blasts, transient reductions occurred with a rebound following the 7-day treatment period. H3 acetylation increase was significant in B-cells (CD19(+); P = 0.02) and blasts (CD34(+); P = 0.04). The increase in H2B acetylation was highest in CD19(+) and CD34(+) cells [3.8-fold (P = 0.01) and 4.4-fold (P = 0.03), respectively]. The median acetylation of histones H2B and H3 in CD34(+) and CD19(+) cells significantly increased on therapy as did apoptosis in CD14(+) cells.

Because of the correlation between FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we conducted a phase 1 trial of tandutinib in 40 patients with either AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Tandutinib was given orally in doses ranging from 50 mg to 700 mg twice daily The principal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of tandutinib was reversible generalized muscular weakness, fatigue, or both, occurring at doses of 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily. Tandutinib's pharmacokinetics were characterized by slow elimination, with achievement of steady-state plasma concentrations requiring greater than 1 week of dosing. Western blotting showed that tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 in circulating leukemic blasts. Eight patients had FLT3-ITD mutations; 5 of these were evaluable for assessment of tandutinib's antileukemic effect. Two of the 5 patients, treated at 525 mg and 700 mg twice daily, showed evidence of antileukemic activity, with decreases in both peripheral and bone marrow blasts. Tandutinib at the MTD (525 mg twice daily) should be evaluated more extensively in patients with AML with FLT3-ITD mutations to better define its antileukemic activity.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4912.0,203.0,Tandutinib MLN518/CT53518 novel quinazoline-based inhibitor type III receptor tyrosine kinases FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 FLT3 platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR KIT correlation FLT3 internal tandem duplication ITD poor prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia AML conducted phase 1 trial tandutinib 40 patients AML high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome MDS Tandutinib given orally doses ranging 50 mg 700 mg twice daily principal dose-limiting toxicity DLT tandutinib reversible generalized muscular weakness fatigue occurring doses 525 mg 700 mg twice daily Tandutinib 's pharmacokinetics characterized slow elimination achievement steady-state plasma concentrations requiring greater 1 week dosing Western blotting showed tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation FLT3 circulating leukemic blasts patients FLT3-ITD 5 evaluable assessment tandutinib 's antileukemic effect 5 patients treated 525 mg 700 mg twice daily showed evidence antileukemic activity decreases peripheral bone marrow blasts Tandutinib MTD 525 mg twice daily evaluated extensively patients AML FLT3-ITD better define antileukemic activity,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[15695, 38230, 55691, 16, 8, 229, 26185, 90, 230, 1, 3, 267, 316, 153, 564, 1549, 5516, 733, 564, 216, 27, 1224, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 4103, 2, 1164, 408, 1, 3, 816, 59, 1224, 2329, 2905, 4616, 2837, 138, 2, 334, 356, 4, 286, 2194, 329, 21, 426, 8, 124, 14, 160, 1, 15695, 4, 327, 7, 5, 361, 329, 15, 64, 43, 681, 1223, 15695, 10, 447, 1428, 4, 415, 2223, 29, 212, 81, 6, 5692, 81, 936, 391, 3, 4312, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1, 15695, 10, 2786, 4169, 8620, 6408, 613, 15, 110, 1821, 28, 415, 1, 10223, 81, 2, 5692, 81, 936, 391, 15695, 292, 1159, 11, 765, 20, 3645, 3730, 5, 5088, 1, 4152, 1309, 554, 1003, 1888, 378, 76, 14, 647, 1, 1280, 1521, 3661, 224, 17, 15695, 879, 982, 1, 1224, 4, 1033, 2015, 2438, 659, 7, 42, 1224, 2837, 138, 33, 1, 46, 11, 859, 9, 455, 1, 15695, 292, 4512, 254, 100, 1, 3, 33, 7, 73, 28, 10223, 81, 2, 5692, 81, 936, 391, 224, 241, 1, 4512, 128, 5, 2140, 4, 110, 672, 2, 581, 2438, 15695, 28, 3, 961, 10223, 81, 936, 391, 257, 40, 194, 80, 3576, 4, 7, 5, 329, 5, 1224, 2837, 138, 6, 380, 1107, 211, 4512, 128]",1372.0,16902153,Phase 1 clinical tandutinib MLN518 novel FLT3 antagonist patients acute myelogenous leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics,146,0.2547993019197208

Cancer,2006-09-27,"The objective of this prospective study was to examine the safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in support of chemotherapy regimens that are administered every 14 d. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma receiving standard ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and decarbazine) chemotherapy every 14 d were eligible for the study. All patients received one fixed dose of 6 mg pegfilgrastim approximately 24h after each ABVD infusion. Absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were measured weekly while on therapy. After completion of therapy, ANCs were measured every 3-4 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. Twenty-three patients received 115 courses (230 doses) of ABVD. Nadir ANC below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was observed only in two cases (1.1%), and ANC counts on the day of ABVD therapy below 1 x 10(9)/L was observed only once (0.4%). No neutropenic fever was observed. Two hundred and fifteen (93.5%) doses of ABVD were given on time as scheduled. Grade 3/4 bone pain was observed after 0.4% of ABVD doses, and bleomycin lung toxicity was observed in two patients. With a median follow-up of 29 months after completion of ABVD, no myelodysplastic syndrome was observed. Two patients relapsed and subsequently underwent successful stem cell collection and transplantation.

Impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for advanced acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2006-10-01,"We reviewed 136 patients with advanced acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic transplantation to assess the impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcome. Thirty-nine patients receiving nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) were compared with 97 patients receiving myeloablative transplantation. Patients receiving NST were at high risk for treatment-related complications given that they were older, 57 vs 43 years (P < .001), and more likely had received previous or myeloablative transplantation (54% vs 2%; P < .0001). The cumulative risk of relapse was higher for patients after NST (61% vs 38%; P = .02). The 100-day mortality was less after NST (15% vs 32%) Overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 28% for NST and 34% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .89). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years was 20% for NST and 31% for myeloablative transplantation (P = .31). Cox regression analysis showed that the intensity of the conditioning regimen had no effect on either OS or PFS. Despite the high-risk features of patients with advanced AML or MDS undergoing NST, OS and PFS in these patients was similar to those in patients receiving myeloablative transplantation. These results demonstrate that dose intensity plays a significant role in control of disease after transplantation, but that this benefit is negated by increasing treatment-related mortality. These results suggest that NST is a reasonable alternative for patients with advanced AML and MDS at high risk for complications after myeloablative transplantation.",Comparative Study,4860.0,148.0,reviewed 136 patients advanced acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS undergoing allogeneic transplantation assess impact conditioning regimen intensity outcome Thirty-nine patients receiving nonmyeloablative stem transplantation NST compared 97 patients receiving myeloablative transplantation Patients receiving NST high risk treatment-related complications given older 57 vs 43 years P .001 likely received previous myeloablative transplantation 54 vs 2 P .0001 cumulative risk relapse higher patients NST 61 vs 38 P .02 100-day mortality NST 15 vs 32 Overall survival OS 2 years 28 NST 34 myeloablative transplantation P .89 Progression-free survival PFS 2 years 20 NST 31 myeloablative transplantation P .31 Cox regression showed intensity conditioning regimen effect OS PFS Despite high-risk features patients advanced AML MDS undergoing NST OS PFS patients similar patients receiving myeloablative transplantation demonstrate dose intensity plays significant role control disease transplantation benefit negated increasing treatment-related mortality suggest NST reasonable alternative patients advanced AML MDS high risk complications myeloablative transplantation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 446, 4829, 7, 5, 131, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 479, 1063, 497, 6, 423, 3, 345, 1, 1933, 477, 837, 23, 228, 977, 762, 7, 357, 6094, 452, 31, 497, 5976, 11, 72, 5, 1015, 7, 357, 3246, 497, 7, 357, 5976, 11, 28, 64, 43, 9, 24, 139, 521, 447, 17, 491, 11, 434, 696, 105, 601, 60, 19, 144, 2, 80, 322, 42, 103, 698, 15, 3246, 497, 667, 105, 18, 19, 488, 3, 967, 43, 1, 429, 10, 142, 9, 7, 50, 5976, 713, 105, 519, 19, 588, 3, 394, 218, 282, 10, 299, 50, 5976, 167, 105, 531, 63, 25, 118, 28, 18, 60, 10, 339, 9, 5976, 2, 562, 9, 3246, 497, 19, 887, 91, 115, 25, 300, 28, 18, 60, 10, 179, 9, 5976, 2, 456, 9, 3246, 497, 19, 456, 418, 320, 65, 224, 17, 3, 837, 1, 3, 1933, 477, 42, 77, 254, 23, 361, 118, 15, 300, 550, 3, 64, 43, 404, 1, 7, 5, 131, 329, 15, 1223, 479, 5976, 118, 2, 300, 4, 46, 7, 10, 288, 6, 135, 4, 7, 357, 3246, 497, 46, 99, 608, 17, 61, 837, 1698, 8, 93, 200, 4, 182, 1, 34, 50, 497, 84, 17, 26, 247, 16, 21413, 20, 602, 24, 139, 282, 46, 99, 309, 17, 5976, 16, 8, 3203, 1091, 9, 7, 5, 131, 329, 2, 1223, 28, 64, 43, 9, 521, 50, 3246, 497]",1521.0,17067911,Impact conditioning regimen intensity outcome allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation advanced acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome,23,0.04013961605584642

In this phase 2 study, we tested the oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in 158 older adults with previously untreated, poor-risk AML. The median age was 74 years, and a majority of patients had antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 22 patients (14%); partial remission or hematologic improvement occurred in 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 23%. The median duration of CR was 7.3 months and the median survival of complete responders was 18 months. Adverse karyotype, age 75 years or older, and poor performance status correlated negatively with survival. Early death in the absence of progressive disease was rare, and drug-related nonhematologic serious adverse events were observed in 74 patients (47%). Inhibition of farnesylation of the surrogate protein HDJ-2 occurred in the large majority of marrow samples tested. Baseline levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT did not correlate with clinical response.

Clin. Oncol.,2006-12-04,"Cloretazine (VNP40101M) is a sulfonylhydrazine alkylating agent with significant antileukemia activity. A multicenter phase II study of cloretazine was conducted in patients 60 years of age or older with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Cloretazine 600 mg/m2 was administered as a single intravenous infusion. Patients were stratified by age, performance score, cytogenetic risk category, type of AML, and comorbidity. One hundred four patients, median age 72 years (range, 60 to 84 years), were treated on study. Performance status was 2 in 31 patients (30%) and no patient had a favorable karyotype. Forty-seven patients (45%) had cardiac disease, 25 patients (24%) had hepatic disease, and 19 patients (18%) had pulmonary disease, defined as per the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, at study entry. The overall response rate was 32%, with 29 patients (28%) achieving complete response (CR) and four patients (4%) achieving CR with incomplete platelet recovery. Response rates in 44 de novo AML patients, 45 secondary AML patients, and 15 high-risk MDS patients were 50%, 11%, and 40%, respectively. Response by cytogenetic risk category was 39% in 56 patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk and 24% in 46 patients with unfavorable cytogenetic risk. Nineteen (18%) patients died within 30 days of receiving cloretazine therapy.

Chromosome 5q deletion and epigenetic suppression of the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) in myeloid cell transformation.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2006-12-10,"Interstitial loss of all or part of the long arm of chromosome 5, or del(5q), is a frequent clonal chromosomal abnormality in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, a preleukemic disorder) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by deleting one or more tumor-suppressor genes. Although a major commonly deleted region (CDR) has been delineated on chromosome band 5q31.1 (refs. 3-7), attempts to identify tumor suppressors within this band have been unsuccessful. We focused our analysis of gene expression on RNA from primitive leukemia-initiating cells, which harbor 5q deletions, and analyzed 12 genes within the CDR that are expressed by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here we show that the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) is expressed at a much lower level in leukemia-initiating stem cells from individuals with AML or MDS with a 5q deletion than in individuals with MDS or AML lacking a 5q deletion or in normal hematopoietic stem cells. Analysis of HL-60 cells, a myeloid leukemia line with deletion of the 5q31 region, showed that the CTNNA1 promoter of the retained allele is suppressed by both methylation and histone deacetylation. Restoration of CTNNA1 expression in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Thus, loss of expression of the alpha-catenin tumor suppressor in hematopoietic stem cells may provide a growth advantage that contributes to human MDS or AML with del(5q).",Journal Article,4790.0,163.0,Interstitial loss long arm chromosome 5 del 5q frequent clonal chromosomal abnormality human myelodysplastic syndrome MDS preleukemic disorder acute myeloid leukemia AML thought contribute pathogenesis diseases deleting tumor-suppressor major commonly deleted region CDR delineated chromosome band 5q31.1 refs 3-7 attempts identify suppressors band unsuccessful focused expression RNA primitive leukemia-initiating harbor 5q deletions 12 CDR expressed normal hematopoietic stem encoding alpha-catenin CTNNA1 expressed lower level leukemia-initiating stem individuals AML MDS 5q deletion individuals MDS AML lacking 5q deletion normal hematopoietic stem HL-60 myeloid leukemia line deletion 5q31 region showed CTNNA1 promoter retained allele suppressed methylation histone deacetylation Restoration CTNNA1 expression HL-60 resulted reduced proliferation apoptotic death loss expression alpha-catenin suppressor hematopoietic stem provide growth advantage contributes human MDS AML del 5q,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4543, 407, 1, 62, 15, 760, 1, 3, 319, 475, 1, 1170, 33, 15, 3084, 5460, 16, 8, 908, 1946, 1860, 3698, 4, 171, 681, 1223, 8, 19788, 2645, 2, 286, 533, 329, 2, 16, 2739, 6, 1248, 6, 3, 1384, 1, 46, 1342, 20, 31039, 104, 15, 80, 30, 1245, 214, 242, 8, 458, 841, 4389, 1053, 13586, 71, 85, 5610, 23, 1170, 7679, 22069, 14, 22067, 27, 67, 4374, 6, 255, 30, 5704, 262, 26, 7679, 47, 85, 7581, 21, 1649, 114, 65, 1, 145, 55, 23, 893, 29, 5594, 2647, 2637, 37, 92, 2760, 5460, 2439, 2, 311, 133, 214, 262, 3, 13586, 17, 32, 570, 20, 295, 1007, 452, 37, 467, 21, 514, 17, 3, 145, 2362, 950, 1778, 17917, 16, 570, 28, 8, 1802, 280, 301, 4, 2647, 2637, 452, 37, 29, 869, 5, 329, 15, 1223, 5, 8, 5460, 1528, 76, 4, 869, 5, 1223, 15, 329, 1941, 8, 5460, 1528, 15, 4, 295, 1007, 452, 37, 65, 1, 1718, 335, 37, 8, 533, 328, 5, 1528, 1, 3, 22069, 1053, 224, 17, 3, 17917, 973, 1, 3, 3532, 1254, 16, 1908, 20, 110, 569, 2, 1508, 15191, 5194, 1, 17917, 55, 4, 1718, 335, 37, 627, 4, 405, 457, 2, 1631, 31, 273, 631, 407, 1, 55, 1, 3, 950, 1778, 30, 1245, 4, 1007, 452, 37, 68, 377, 8, 129, 1874, 17, 2444, 6, 171, 1223, 15, 329, 5, 3084, 5460]",1425.0,17159988,Chromosome 5q deletion epigenetic suppression encoding alpha-catenin CTNNA1 myeloid transformation,9,0.015706806282722512

However, there are few data addressing the appropriateness of such classification. We studied 155 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML)/t-MDS to determine whether subclassification by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for de novo MDS provides prognostic information in t-MDS. In addition, we assessed whether cytogenetic stratification by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) guidelines or karyotypic complexity was prognostically important. We found no differences in median survival times among patients classified into the different WHO subgroup of MDS or according to their bone marrow blast percentage; our results indicate a uniformly poor outcome in t-MDS regardless of morphologic classification. However, significant survival differences correlated with cytogenetic stratification according to IPSS guidelines and/or karyotypic complexity.

Detrimental effect of natural killer cell alloreactivity in T-replete hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for leukemia patients.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2007-02-01,"In hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), natural killer cell alloreactivity conferred by inhibitory ligands of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRLs) may result in beneficial or detrimental outcomes. More data may contribute to resolution of this complex issue. We analyzed 378 primary allogeneic transplants with T-replete grafts for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 101), acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 149), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 128). The cohort was divided into 3 groups: in group 1, HLA class I matched at the antigen level (n = 260); in group 2, HLA class I mismatched at the antigen level (n = 57); and in group 3, HLA class I and iKIRLs mismatched (n = 61). One-year overall survival (OS) across groups 1 (59%), 2 (49%), and 3 (30%) was significantly different (P = .002). In contrast to group 2, group 3 had statistically lower OS (P = .05) and event-free survival (P = .01). Relapse and relapse-free mortality appeared to contribute to the low OS in group 3. The detrimental effect of natural killer alloreactivity was also evident when HLA-matched transplants were analyzed for patients lacking iKIRLs. One-year OS in patients lacking the HLA-Cw group 1 or 2 iKIRL was significantly lower than that in patients having the iKIRLs (55% vs 67%, n = 246, P = .01).

To improve transplant outcome in this patient population, 43 patients (median age, 46.1 years) with high-risk or advanced lymphoid (n = 5) or myeloid malignancy (n = 38) were prospectively enrolled on a pilot trial of cytoreduction with intravenous busulfan and melphalan followed by an unmodified HLA-A, -B, and -DRbeta1-matched related (n = 18) or unrelated (n = 25) HCT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. Thirty-four patients had > or = 5% blasts at the time of HCT; 12 of these had > 20% blasts. Seventeen patients had unfavorable cytogenetics, 8 patients underwent transplantation for secondary MDS or acute myelogenous leukemia, and 4 patients had relapsed after a previous allogeneic transplantation. Although mucositis was the most significant regimen-related toxicity, requiring the addition of folinic acid rescue and failure to receive all 4 doses of methotrexate in 23 patients, the nonrelapse mortality at 30 and 100 days was low at 0% and 16%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 24%, and that of extensive chronic GVHD was 7%. With a minimum follow-up of 18 months, the estimated 3-year overall survival is 37% and the estimated disease-free survival (DFS) is 33%.

Risk-based management of myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)","Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",2007-01-01,"Most adult patients with hematopoietic failure due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are treated with supportive care measures, including hematopoietic growth factors (epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, sargramostim), red blood cell or platelet transfusions, and antimicrobial agents. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be curative, but only a small subset of patients are eligible for transplantation, and until recently there were few options other than supportive care for transplant-ineligible patients. Since 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three new therapies specifically for the indication of MDS: two DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (azacitidine and decitabine) and an immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide). Several other drugs are used by clinicians for treatment of patients with MDS, but are not specifically FDA-approved for this indication. With several therapeutic options available, yet none of them effective in the majority of cases, it can be challenging for clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient. Here we discuss a risk-based management approach to MDS that incorporates recent data regarding these new therapies.

Survival advantage with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome: comparison with historical experience.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-03-01,"Decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, is active and has been approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy is an accepted form of therapy for patients with higher risk MDS. The comparative efficacy of these 2 forms of treatment in MDS is unknown. The objective of the current study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of decitabine and intensive chemotherapy in MDS. The authors compared lower intensity decitabine therapy (n = 115 patients) with intensive chemotherapy (as it is used in acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients with higher risk MDS. Two comparisons were made with a cohort of 376 historic patients (from 1995 to 2005): The first comparison included a subcohort of 115 patients (Group A) who matched the 115 decitabine study patients according to age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and cytogenetics; and the second comparison included the whole cohort of 376 patients without matching (Group B). A multivariate analysis was performed for outcome. The complete remission (CR) rate according to AML criteria was 43% with decitabine, 46% with intensive chemotherapy in Group A, and 52% with intensive chemotherapy in Group B. Compared with Group A, mortality at 6 weeks was 3% with decitabine versus 13% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .006) and, at 3 months, 7% with decitabine versus 23% with intensive chemotherapy (P = .001). Survival was better with decitabine versus intensive chemotherapy in Group A (median survival: 22 months vs 12 months; P < .001).

Darbepoetin alfa: an effective treatment with flexible and simplified dosing for anemia in patients with cancer.,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,2007-03-01,"Anemia is common in patients with cancer or myelodysplastic syndrome. Erythropoietic therapy offers an effective way to manage anemia by increasing hemoglobin levels, decreasing transfusion requirements, and alleviating symptoms. We reviewed data showing the feasibility and effectiveness of treatment with the erythropoiesis-stimulating protein darbepoetin alfa at extended dosing intervals to treat anemia in patients with cancer receiving multicycle chemotherapy. We also explored the darbepoetin alfa's potential for treating anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Data from clinical studies and drug therapy evaluations confirm that darbepoetin alfa administered weekly, every 2 weeks, and every 3 weeks corrects and maintains hemoglobin levels in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. In addition, the data demonstrate that both weight-based and fixed dosing with darbepoetin alfa are effective, and that early intervention to treat anemia has clinical benefits. Darbepoetin alfa also is an effective treatment for anemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, at extended dosing intervals of at least 3 weeks. Extended dosing for anemia treatment can provide benefits for patients, caregivers, and clinicians because it reduces the number of clinic visits needed and permits synchronizing anemia treatment with chemotherapy cycles. Data from recent studies suggest that darbepoetin alfa is effective for treating anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome; this potential use is being investigated further in ongoing studies. Thus, darbepoetin alfa is an attractive therapy option for patients with chemotherapy or cancer-induced anemia. It allows increased flexibility and simplified dosing and may offer some benefit in the treatment of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.",Journal Article,4709.0,3.0,Anemia common patients myelodysplastic syndrome Erythropoietic therapy offers effective way manage anemia increasing hemoglobin levels decreasing transfusion requirements alleviating symptoms reviewed showing feasibility effectiveness treatment erythropoiesis-stimulating darbepoetin alfa extended dosing intervals treat anemia patients receiving multicycle chemotherapy explored darbepoetin alfa 's potential treating anemia patients myelodysplastic syndrome clinical studies drug therapy evaluations confirm darbepoetin alfa administered weekly 2 weeks 3 weeks corrects maintains hemoglobin levels patients chemotherapy-induced anemia addition demonstrate weight-based fixed dosing darbepoetin alfa effective early intervention treat anemia clinical benefits Darbepoetin alfa effective treatment anemia patients receiving chemotherapy extended dosing intervals 3 weeks Extended dosing anemia treatment provide benefits patients caregivers clinicians reduces number clinic visits needed permits synchronizing anemia treatment chemotherapy cycles recent studies suggest darbepoetin alfa effective treating anemia patients myelodysplastic syndrome potential use investigated ongoing studies darbepoetin alfa attractive therapy option patients chemotherapy cancer-induced anemia allows increased flexibility simplified dosing offer benefit treatment anemia patients myelodysplastic syndrome,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1545, 16, 186, 4, 7, 5, 12, 15, 681, 14276, 36, 2339, 35, 323, 2255, 6, 4001, 1545, 20, 602, 2222, 148, 2777, 2785, 4230, 2, 12956, 507, 21, 446, 74, 2069, 3, 1437, 2, 1236, 1, 24, 5, 3, 10297, 2122, 178, 11502, 4443, 28, 1747, 1280, 1582, 6, 943, 1545, 4, 7, 5, 12, 357, 30515, 56, 21, 120, 1443, 3, 11502, 4443, 292, 174, 9, 1367, 1545, 4, 7, 5, 681, 74, 29, 38, 94, 2, 234, 36, 3816, 1843, 17, 11502, 4443, 468, 709, 454, 18, 244, 2, 454, 27, 244, 28233, 2, 8107, 2222, 148, 4, 7, 5, 56, 277, 1545, 4, 352, 3, 74, 608, 17, 110, 924, 90, 2, 1959, 1280, 5, 11502, 4443, 32, 323, 2, 17, 191, 788, 6, 943, 1545, 71, 38, 1141, 11502, 4443, 120, 16, 35, 323, 24, 9, 1545, 4, 7, 5, 12, 44, 357, 56, 28, 1747, 1280, 1582, 1, 28, 506, 27, 244, 1747, 1280, 9, 1545, 24, 122, 377, 1141, 9, 7, 2771, 2, 1490, 408, 192, 2389, 3, 207, 1, 1188, 2690, 575, 2, 8504, 31063, 1545, 24, 5, 56, 410, 74, 29, 435, 94, 309, 17, 11502, 4443, 16, 323, 9, 1367, 1545, 4, 7, 5, 681, 26, 174, 119, 16, 486, 565, 195, 4, 942, 94, 631, 11502, 4443, 16, 35, 3059, 36, 1501, 9, 7, 5, 56, 15, 12, 277, 1545, 192, 2333, 101, 9794, 2, 8087, 1280, 2, 68, 1918, 476, 247, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1545, 4, 7, 5, 681]",1745.0,17316154,Darbepoetin alfa effective treatment flexible simplified dosing anemia patients,0,0.0
Is secondary leukemia an independent poor prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia?,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2007-03-01,"Secondary leukemia is a poorly defined term that often refers to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following the history of a previous disease, such as a myelodysplastic syndrome or a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Secondary leukemia can also be a consequence of treatment with chemotherapy, including alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, and/or radiotherapy, or due to exposure to environmental carcinogens. Outcomes for this large and variable group of patients with secondary AML have been poor compared to people who develop AML de novo. The question arises whether a diagnosis of secondary leukemia per se indicates a poor prognosis or whether their bad outcomes result from an association with certain morphologic and biologic characteristics. Morphologic dysplasia in de novo AML is related to unfavorable cytogenetics, but has no independent prognostic relevance under the conditions of intensive chemotherapy. While there is no significant correlation between cytogenetic risk groups and dysplasia, cytogenetic features do have an impact on outcome among both de novo and secondary AML patients. In various subgroups of secondary AML, the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities is similar to de novo AML, but the frequency of abnormalities associated with unfavorable and intermediate risk cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype, trisomy 8, monosomy 7, and others, is higher in secondary AML. The survival of patients with therapy-related myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is generally shorter than for those with de novo AML within the same cytogenetic risk group. Across the population of t-AML, however, survival varies according to cytogenetic risk group, with longer survival in patients with favorable-risk karyotypes. The term secondary AML is too broad and imprecise to be of importance and should not be used. These AML patients should be enrolled on front-line chemotherapy trials and should be stratified by pretreatment disease status and exposure history, if necessary. Most importantly, the molecular and genetic differences that appear to determine the phenotype and the outcome of these patients need to be investigated further.",Journal Article,4709.0,55.0,Secondary leukemia poorly defined term refers development acute myeloid leukemia AML following history previous disease myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myeloproliferative disorder Secondary leukemia consequence treatment chemotherapy including alkylating agents topoisomerase II inhibitors and/or radiotherapy exposure environmental carcinogens Outcomes large variable group patients secondary AML poor compared people develop AML novo question arises diagnosis secondary leukemia se indicates poor prognosis bad outcomes association certain morphologic biologic characteristics Morphologic dysplasia novo AML related unfavorable cytogenetics independent prognostic relevance conditions intensive chemotherapy significant correlation cytogenetic risk groups dysplasia cytogenetic features impact outcome novo secondary AML patients subgroups secondary AML spectrum cytogenetic abnormalities similar novo AML frequency abnormalities associated unfavorable intermediate risk cytogenetics complex karyotype trisomy 8 monosomy 7 higher secondary AML survival patients therapy-related myeloid leukemia t-AML generally shorter novo AML cytogenetic risk group population t-AML survival varies according cytogenetic risk group longer survival patients favorable-risk karyotypes term secondary AML broad imprecise importance AML patients enrolled front-line chemotherapy trials stratified pretreatment disease status exposure history necessary importantly molecular genetic differences appear determine phenotype outcome patients need investigated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[568, 16, 8, 1240, 395, 337, 17, 629, 11312, 6, 3, 193, 1, 286, 533, 329, 366, 3, 532, 1, 8, 698, 34, 225, 22, 8, 681, 15, 8, 442, 2645, 568, 122, 120, 40, 8, 4177, 1, 24, 5, 56, 141, 3410, 183, 2, 3999, 215, 222, 2, 15, 310, 15, 520, 6, 645, 6, 3766, 8850, 123, 9, 26, 375, 2, 1347, 87, 1, 7, 5, 568, 329, 47, 85, 334, 72, 6, 3788, 54, 690, 329, 1566, 2018, 3, 2840, 6053, 317, 8, 147, 1, 568, 379, 3428, 2640, 8, 334, 356, 15, 317, 136, 5618, 123, 757, 29, 35, 248, 5, 1840, 2815, 2, 1283, 374, 2815, 2253, 4, 1566, 2018, 329, 16, 139, 6, 2483, 2510, 84, 71, 77, 306, 177, 2088, 669, 3, 1298, 1, 1686, 56, 369, 125, 16, 77, 93, 816, 59, 1266, 43, 271, 2, 2253, 1266, 404, 1022, 47, 35, 345, 23, 228, 107, 110, 1566, 2018, 2, 568, 329, 7, 4, 747, 1453, 1, 568, 329, 3, 1873, 1, 1266, 1171, 16, 288, 6, 1566, 2018, 329, 84, 3, 675, 1, 1171, 41, 5, 2483, 2, 919, 43, 2510, 225, 22, 8, 840, 3385, 6317, 66, 7521, 67, 2, 1749, 16, 142, 4, 568, 329, 3, 25, 1, 7, 5, 36, 139, 533, 102, 329, 16, 1228, 985, 76, 9, 135, 5, 1566, 2018, 329, 262, 3, 827, 1266, 43, 87, 716, 3, 266, 1, 102, 329, 137, 25, 4037, 768, 6, 1266, 43, 87, 5, 589, 25, 4, 7, 5, 913, 43, 6809, 3, 337, 568, 329, 16, 5044, 2094, 2, 18486, 6, 40, 1, 1187, 2, 257, 44, 40, 95, 46, 329, 7, 257, 40, 346, 23, 3007, 328, 56, 143, 2, 257, 40, 1173, 20, 1194, 34, 156, 2, 645, 532, 492, 1493, 96, 1859, 3, 219, 2, 336, 362, 17, 1322, 6, 223, 3, 1005, 2, 3, 228, 1, 46, 7, 594, 6, 40, 565, 195]",2066.0,17336252,secondary leukemia independent poor prognostic factor acute myeloid leukemia,94,0.16404886561954624
Reduced natural killer (NK) function associated with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and reduced expression of activating NK receptors.,Blood,Blood,2007-03-06,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with potential for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

NK cytotoxicity in MDS patients was reduced against 3 disparate tumor targets with differential activating receptor requirement, suggesting global defects in NK function. Reduced NK function in MDS was significantly associated with higher International Prognostic Score (P = .01), abnormal karyotype (P = .05), the presence of excess blasts (P = .01), and age-adjusted bone marrow hypercellularity (P = .04). MDS patients had a display of the activating receptor NKp30, and NKG2D down-regulation closely correlated with impaired NK function (P = .001). NKG2D ligands (MICA and MICB) were expressed on CD34(+) cells from bone marrow of 30% of MDS patients and a leukemic cell line derived from an MDS patient (MDS1).

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome using reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2007-02-08,"Reduced-intensity conditioning has extended the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to patients otherwise not eligible for this treatment due to older age or frailty. One hundred twelve acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes patients received fludarabine and melphalan (FM) conditioning with allogeneic HSCT. Most patients (73%) were not in remission. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate. Median age was 55 years (range, 22-74). Donors were related (53%) and unrelated (47%). Median follow-up of surviving patients (n = 43) was 29.4 months (range, 13.1-87.7). The complete remission (CR) rate was 82%. Estimates of 2-year survival were 66%, 40%, and 23% for patients in CR, with active disease without and with circulating blasts at HSCT, respectively. In multivariate analysis, survival was negatively influenced by active disease at HSCT and development of grade II-IV acute GVHD. Presence of circulating blasts at HSCT negatively influenced freedom from disease progression.

"Haploinsufficiency of EGR1, a candidate gene in the del(5q), leads to the development of myeloid disorders.",Blood,Blood,2007-04-09,"Loss of a whole chromosome 5 or a deletion of the long arm, del(5q), is a recurring abnormality in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify a leukemia-related gene on chromosome 5, we previously delineated a 970-kb segment of 5q31 that is deleted in all patients examined, and prepared a transcript map of this region. EGR1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene within the commonly deleted segment of 5q, and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor. To test the hypothesis that loss of function of Egr1 is an initiating event in the pathogenesis of AML/MDS, Egr1-deficient mice were treated with a potent DNA alkylating agent, N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU), to induce secondary cooperating mutations. Egr1(+/-) and Egr1(-/-) mice treated with ENU developed immature T-cell lymphomas (CD4(+), CD8(+)) or a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) at increased rates and with shorter latencies than that of wild-type littermates. The MPD was characterized by an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with ineffective erythropoiesis. Biallelic mutations of Egr1 were not observed in MPDs in Egr1(+/-) mice.

Impact of cytogenetics on outcome of de novo and therapy-related AML and MDS after allogeneic transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2007-03-21,"Cytogenetics has an important impact on the prognosis of patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, it is unclear whether currently accepted cytogenetic risk groups, which were established for patients treated mostly with standard therapy, are optimally discriminating for patients undergoing HSCT. Also, the impact of cytogenetics in the growing population of patients with therapy-related disease has not been completely elucidated. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed data on 556 patients with AML or MDS transplanted at our institution. We examined, in multivariate analyses, the contribution of cytogenetics to survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality for the 476 patients with de novo disease. We used these results to establish an optimal cytogenetic grouping scheme. We then applied this grouping scheme to the 80 patients with therapy-related disease. Our proposed 3-group cytogenetic classification outperformed the established grouping schemes for both de novo and therapy-related disease. When classified by this new scheme, cytogenetics was the strongest prognostic factor for overall survival in our cohort, through its impact on the risk of relapse (and not on nonrelapse mortality). After accounting for cytogenetics, patients with therapy-related AML or MDS had an equivalent outcome to those with de novo disease. This study demonstrates the impact of cytogenetics on the risk of relapse and death for patients with both de novo and therapy-related disease undergoing transplantation; it also emphasizes the necessity of using cytogenetics to stratify patients entering clinical trials, and provides a system for doing so, which can be validated in a multi-institutional database.",Journal Article,4689.0,111.0,Cytogenetics important impact prognosis patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation HSCT acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndromes MDS unclear currently accepted cytogenetic risk groups established patients treated standard therapy optimally discriminating patients undergoing HSCT impact cytogenetics growing population patients therapy-related disease completely elucidated retrospectively 556 patients AML MDS transplanted institution examined multivariate contribution cytogenetics survival relapse nonrelapse mortality 476 patients novo disease establish optimal cytogenetic grouping scheme applied grouping scheme 80 patients therapy-related disease proposed 3-group cytogenetic classification outperformed established grouping schemes novo therapy-related disease classified new scheme cytogenetics strongest prognostic factor overall survival cohort impact risk relapse nonrelapse mortality accounting cytogenetics patients therapy-related AML MDS equivalent outcome novo disease demonstrates impact cytogenetics risk relapse death patients novo therapy-related disease undergoing transplantation emphasizes necessity cytogenetics stratify patients entering clinical trials provides validated multi-institutional database,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2510, 71, 35, 305, 345, 23, 3, 356, 1, 7, 479, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 9, 286, 2194, 329, 15, 2040, 1223, 137, 192, 16, 1200, 317, 694, 3058, 1266, 43, 271, 92, 11, 635, 9, 7, 73, 2754, 5, 260, 36, 32, 5074, 8059, 9, 7, 479, 1703, 120, 3, 345, 1, 2510, 4, 3, 1921, 266, 1, 7, 5, 36, 139, 34, 71, 44, 85, 2500, 3901, 4, 26, 45, 21, 894, 311, 74, 23, 12341, 7, 5, 329, 15, 1223, 4600, 28, 114, 731, 21, 409, 4, 331, 318, 3, 2925, 1, 2510, 6, 25, 429, 2, 4640, 282, 9, 3, 10652, 7, 5, 1566, 2018, 34, 21, 95, 46, 99, 6, 1811, 35, 665, 1266, 6946, 4633, 21, 818, 1498, 26, 6946, 4633, 6, 3, 493, 7, 5, 36, 139, 34, 114, 1587, 27, 87, 1266, 947, 9504, 3, 635, 6946, 7103, 9, 110, 1566, 2018, 2, 36, 139, 34, 198, 1373, 20, 26, 217, 4633, 2510, 10, 3, 3311, 177, 161, 9, 63, 25, 4, 114, 180, 298, 211, 345, 23, 3, 43, 1, 429, 2, 44, 23, 4640, 282, 50, 3116, 9, 2510, 7, 5, 36, 139, 329, 15, 1223, 42, 35, 2017, 228, 6, 135, 5, 1566, 2018, 34, 26, 45, 1902, 3, 345, 1, 2510, 23, 3, 43, 1, 429, 2, 273, 9, 7, 5, 110, 1566, 2018, 2, 36, 139, 34, 479, 497, 192, 120, 7519, 3, 7378, 1, 75, 2510, 6, 3570, 7, 7653, 38, 143, 2, 777, 8, 398, 9, 9647, 1743, 92, 122, 40, 938, 4, 8, 1414, 1115, 609]",1766.0,17531775,Impact cytogenetics outcome novo therapy-related AML MDS allogeneic transplantation,2,0.0034904013961605585

Acute myeloid leukemia after adjuvant breast cancer therapy in older women: understanding risk.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-07-30,"The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in older women. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database were used for women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer from 1992 to 2002. The primary end point was a claim with an inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of AML (International Classification of Diseases ninth revision, codes 205 to 208), comparing patients treated with and without adjuvant chemotherapy, and by differing chemotherapy regimens. The cumulative hazard of AML was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine factors independently associated with the development of AML. In this observational study, there were 64,715 patients: 10,130 received adjuvant chemotherapy and 54,585 did not. The median patient age was 75.6 years (range, 66 to 104 years). The mean follow-up was 54.8 months (range, 13 to 144 months). The absolute risk of developing AML at 10 years after any adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was 1.8% versus 1.2% for women who had not received chemotherapy. The adjusted hazard ratio for AML with adjuvant chemotherapy versus none was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.06). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) within the first year of diagnosis did not convey a significantly increased risk of AML (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.92).

Decitabine and its role in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2007-08-01,"DNA methylation is responsible for abnormal silencing of many genes, including tumor suppressor genes, in cancer. Decitabine, an S-phase specific inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, has been shown to decrease levels of abnormal methylation in neoplasia. Though initially investigated at high doses as a cytotoxic agent, recent studies show that when administered at low doses, the hypomethylating activity of decitabine is increased with a demonstrated increase in activity in hematopoietic malignancies. Multiple clinical trials, both in the United States and in Europe, have demonstrated the efficacy of decitabine in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of (MDS), decitabine represents an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option in this disease, for which treatment options were previously scarce.

Clin. Oncol.,2007-08-01,"Older node-positive patients treated with newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have improvements in relapse-free and overall survival similar to younger patients. We compared toxicity of older and younger patients in three randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy. Toxicity data were available for 93% of 6,642 patients enrolled. The three trials included: Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8541, a comparison of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in three dose schedules; CALGB 9344: cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel; and CALGB 9741: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel every 2 versus every 3 weeks. National Cancer Institute grade 3 to 5 toxicities were compared among age groups. Seven percent of patients (n = 458) were age 65 or older, 3% were 70 or older, 38% were 51 to 64, and 55% were 50 or younger. Twenty-four deaths (0.4%) were attributed to treatment; seven (1.5%) of 486 in patients 65 or older, 10 (0.40%) of 2,480 in patients who were 51 to 64 years, and seven (0.19%) of 3,676 occurred in patients younger than 50. In multivariate analysis, older patients were significantly more likely to have grade 4 hematologic toxicity, to have discontinued treatment for toxicity, or to have died of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. There were no significant differences in grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Healthy older patients who met the strict eligibility criteria for these trials had a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and treatment-related deaths than younger patients, but no increase in nonhematologic toxicity.

Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia in patients treated with ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-08-20,"To investigate the incidence of treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and treatment-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML) after treatment with ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy. Analysis of the incidence of t-MDS and t-AML in 746 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen in registration and compassionate-use trials between 1996 and 2002. Nineteen patients (2.5%) developed t-MDS or t-AML at a median follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 0 to 9.3). These malignancies were diagnosed at a median of 5.6 years (range, 1.4 to 13.9) after the diagnosis of NHL and 1.9 years (range, 0.4 to 6.3) after radioimmunotherapy. The annualized rates were 0.3% per year after the diagnosis of NHL and 0.7% per year after treatment. Most patients with t-MDS or t-AML had multiple cytogenetic aberrations, commonly on chromosomes 5 and 7, suggesting an association with previous exposure to chemotherapy. Analysis of data from patients in registration and compassionate-use trials suggests that the annualized incidences of t-MDS and t-AML are consistent with that expected in patients with NHL who have had extensive previous chemotherapy treatment and do not appear to be increased after treatment with the ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen.

The use of hypomethylating agents in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2007-09-01,"Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, are abnormal in cancer cells, and the use of the hypomethylating agents 5-azacitidine and decitabine are important additions to our arsenal of active cancer drugs, especially for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Most effective are repeated cycles of the drugs given at doses much lower than originally tested. Typical overall response rates (complete responses + partial responses + hematologic improvement) for both drugs are in the range of 40 - 50%. These agents are generally very well tolerated, with myelosuppression being the major side effect.

"Clofarabine: past, present, and future.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2007-10-01,"Clofarabine is a good generation purine nucleoside analogue designed to overcome the limitations and to incorporate the best qualities of both cladribine and fludarabine. Clofarabine is thought to work via three mechanisms: inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase; incorporation to DNA; and induction of apoptosis. Given these mechanism of action, clofarabine would be predicted to act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents such as other purine nucleoside analogues and DNA damaging or cross linking agents such as anthracyclines and platinum-based compounds. Intravenous clofarabine showed significant efficacy in pediatric leukemias (specifically, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) and, in 2004, it was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pediatric relapsed/refractory ALL after at least two regimens. In adults, clofarabine has shown significant efficacy in hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) alone and in combinations.

We hypothesized that with new precise methods more cryptic karyotypic lesions can be uncovered that may show important clinical implications. We have applied 250K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arrays (SNP-A) to study chromosomal lesions in samples from 174 patients (94 MDS, 33 secondary acute myeloid leukemia [sAML], and 47 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease [MDS/MPD]) and 76 controls. Using SNP-A, aberrations were found in around three-fourths of MDS, MDS/MPD, and sAML (vs 59%, 37%, 53% by MC; in 8% of patients MC was unsuccessful). Previously unrecognized lesions were detected in patients with normal MC and in those with known lesions. Moreover, segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) was found in 20% of MDS, 23% of sAML, and 35% of MDS/MPD patients, a lesion resulting in copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity undetectable by MC. The potential clinical significance of abnormalities detected by SNP-A, but not seen on MC, was demonstrated by their impact on overall survival. UPD involving chromosomes frequently affected by deletions may have prognostic implications similar to the deletions visible by MC.

A phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the safety and activity of oral vorinostat 100 to 300 mg twice or thrice daily for 14 days followed by 1-week rest. Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and untreated patients who were not candidates for chemotherapy were eligible. Of 41 patients, 31 had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 3 MDS, 2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 chronic myelocytic leukemia. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 200 mg twice daily or 250 mg thrice daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Common drug-related adverse experiences were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and anorexia and were mild/moderate in severity. Grade 3/4 drug-related adverse experiences included fatigue (27%), thrombocytopenia (12%), and diarrhea (10%).

At present, no transplantation-specific risk score exists for this patient population. We propose a simple scoring system for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or MDS, based on a retrospective analysis of 445 patients undergoing SCT at our institution (divided into training and validation subsets). The score depends on 5 variables: age, disease, stage at transplantation, cytogenetics, and pretransplantation ferritin. It divides patients into 3 groups of comparable size, with 5-year overall survival (OS) of 56% (low risk), 22% (intermediate risk), and 5% (high risk).

DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2008-01-01,"The recently approved drugs 5-azacitidine (5AC) and 5-aza-2'-deoxyazacytidine (DAC) are in wide clinical use for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of all types and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). These agents were developed based upon an understanding of the importance of epigenetic changes in malignancy, and they have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, which demonstrate response rates between 20% and 40% in patients for whom no previous standard of care was available. As understanding of the epigenetic changes characteristic of the malignant phenotype improves, we are able to target other regulators of chromatin conformation that contribute to aberrant gene transcription and dysregulated cell growth. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors belong to one class of therapeutics developed using this paradigm. Although responses using HDAC inhibitors alone in MDS have been modest, robust preclinical data drive clinical trials in which they are utilized in combination with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.

Myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant using T cell depleted allografts followed by post-transplant GM-CSF in high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2008-02-07,"Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (alloBMT) remains the only curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but its application has been limited by the older age range of patients with this disease. T cell depletion decreases transplant-related toxicity related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but does not improve overall survival because of increased risk for relapse and graft failure. Myeloid growth factors have been used to speed engraftment following alloBMT, but data suggest that they may also have anti-tumor properties. We treated 43 patients (median age 56) with MDS/AML with high-risk features using a myeloablative T cell depleted alloBMT followed by prolonged systemic GM-CSF. The current event-free survival at 1 and 3 years was 47% and 34%, respectively with a median follow-up of 22.8 months in surviving patients.

Phase II study of azacitidine to restore responsiveness of prostate cancer to hormonal therapy.,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2007-12-01,"Epigenetic alterations, including methylation of key tumor suppressor genes, may play a role in the progression of prostate cancer to a castration-refractory state. Azacitidine, an agent approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, appears to exert its antineoplastic effects partly by hypomethylating DNA that leads to the reversal of gene silencing. It is hypothesized that the addition of azacitidine to complete androgen blockade may restore the responsiveness of progressive prostate cancer to hormonal therapy. A phase II trial was designed to evaluate the activity of azacitidine to primarily modulate PSA kinetics, with supportive secondary clinical endpoints. Correlative studies will be performed to detect the biologic activity of azacitidine (increased fetal hemoglobin, plasma DNA methylation) and examine any association with anti-tumor clinical activity.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4434.0,11.0,Epigenetic alterations including methylation key suppressor play role progression prostate castration-refractory state Azacitidine agent approved treatment myelodysplastic syndromes appears exert antineoplastic effects partly hypomethylating DNA leads reversal silencing hypothesized addition azacitidine complete androgen blockade restore responsiveness progressive prostate hormonal therapy phase II trial designed evaluate activity azacitidine primarily modulate PSA kinetics supportive secondary clinical endpoints Correlative studies performed detect biologic activity azacitidine increased fetal hemoglobin plasma DNA methylation examine association anti-tumor clinical activity,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1418, 593, 141, 569, 1, 825, 30, 1245, 214, 68, 1343, 8, 200, 4, 3, 91, 1, 12, 6, 8, 1517, 430, 1309, 3752, 35, 420, 850, 9, 3, 24, 1, 2040, 1233, 6, 5448, 211, 3940, 176, 5180, 20, 4931, 261, 17, 1940, 6, 3, 5933, 1, 145, 2077, 192, 16, 1237, 17, 3, 352, 1, 3752, 6, 236, 687, 1189, 68, 6075, 3, 3642, 1, 1014, 12, 6, 1761, 36, 8, 124, 215, 160, 10, 1114, 6, 376, 3, 128, 1, 3752, 6, 1561, 3319, 534, 3839, 5, 1877, 568, 38, 1387, 3679, 94, 303, 40, 173, 6, 1426, 3, 1283, 128, 1, 3752, 101, 6698, 2222, 554, 261, 569, 2, 1004, 500, 248, 5, 312, 30, 38, 128]",834.0,18272030,Phase II azacitidine restore responsiveness prostate hormonal therapy,0,0.0
Reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant in patients older than 55 years: unrelated umbilical cord blood is safe and effective for patients without a matched related donor.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2008-03-01,"The lower morbidity and mortality of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have allowed allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in older patients. Unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been investigated as an alternative stem cell source to suitably HLA matched related (MRD) and adult volunteer unrelated donors. We hypothesized that RIC HCT using UCB would be safe and efficacious in older patients, and compared the treatment-related mortality (TRM) and overall survival (OS) of RIC HCT in patients older than 55 years using either MRD (n = 47) or, in patients with no 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 HLA compatible related donors, UCB (n = 43). RIC regimen consisted of total-body irradiation (TBI; 200 cGy) and either cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (n = 69), or busulfan and fludarabine (n = 16) or busulfan and cladribine (n = 5). The median age of MRD and UCB cohorts was 58 (range, 55-70) and 59 (range, 55-69) years, respectively. acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) (50%) was the most common diagnosis. All MRD grafts were 6 of 6 HLA matched to the recipient. Among patients undergoing UCB HCT, 88% received 2 UCB units to optimize cell dose and 93% received 1-2 HLA mismatched grafts. The median follow-up for survivors was 27 (range: 12-61) months. The 3-year probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS; 30% versus 34%, P = .98) and OS (43% versus 34%, P = .57) were similar for recipients of MRD and UCB. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host (aGVHD) disease (42% versus 49%, P = .20) and TRM at 180-days (23% versus 28%, P = .36) were comparable. However, UCB recipients had a lower incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) at 1 year (40% versus 17%, P = .02). On multivariate analysis, graft type had no impact on TRM or survival, and the HCT comorbidity index score was the only factor independently predictive for these endpoints. Our study supports the use of HLA mismatched UCB as an alternative graft source for older patients who need a transplant but do not have an MRD. The use of RIC and UCB extends the availability of transplant therapy to older patients previously excluded on the basis of age and lack of a suitable MRD. A careful review of existing comorbidities is necessary when considering older patients for HCT.",Clinical Trial,4343.0,96.0,lower morbidity mortality reduced-intensity conditioning RIC regimens allowed allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation HCT older patients Unrelated umbilical cord blood UCB investigated alternative stem source suitably HLA matched related MRD adult volunteer unrelated donors hypothesized RIC HCT UCB safe efficacious older patients compared treatment-related mortality TRM overall survival OS RIC HCT patients older 55 years MRD n 47 patients 5 6 6 6 HLA compatible related donors UCB n 43 RIC regimen consisted total-body irradiation TBI 200 cGy cyclophosphamide fludarabine n 69 busulfan fludarabine n 16 busulfan cladribine n 5 median age MRD UCB cohorts 58 range 55-70 59 range 55-69 years respectively acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome AML/MDS 50 common diagnosis MRD grafts 6 6 HLA matched recipient patients undergoing UCB HCT 88 received 2 UCB units optimize dose 93 received 1-2 HLA mismatched grafts median follow-up survivors 27 range 12-61 months 3-year probabilities progression-free survival PFS 30 versus 34 P .98 OS 43 versus 34 P .57 similar recipients MRD UCB cumulative incidence grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host aGVHD disease 42 versus 49 P .20 TRM 180-days 23 versus 28 P .36 comparable UCB recipients lower incidence chronic graft-versus-host disease cGVHD 1 year 40 versus 17 P .02 multivariate graft type impact TRM survival HCT comorbidity index score factor independently predictive endpoints supports use HLA mismatched UCB alternative graft source older patients need transplant MRD use RIC UCB extends availability transplant therapy older patients previously excluded basis age lack suitable MRD careful review existing comorbidities necessary considering older patients HCT,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 280, 787, 2, 282, 1, 405, 837, 1933, 3365, 472, 47, 2313, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 4, 434, 7, 2092, 5998, 1885, 315, 4056, 71, 85, 565, 22, 35, 1091, 452, 31, 2353, 6, 33526, 1160, 655, 139, 2029, 2, 780, 15536, 2092, 2344, 21, 1237, 17, 3365, 1085, 75, 4056, 688, 40, 1165, 2, 3289, 4, 434, 7, 2, 72, 3, 24, 139, 282, 5064, 2, 63, 25, 118, 1, 3365, 1085, 4, 7, 434, 76, 614, 60, 75, 361, 2029, 78, 662, 15, 4, 7, 5, 77, 33, 1, 49, 15, 49, 1, 49, 1160, 7293, 139, 2344, 4056, 78, 601, 3365, 477, 1695, 1, 181, 642, 1104, 4889, 1250, 3071, 2, 361, 1112, 2, 2027, 78, 790, 15, 3906, 2, 2027, 78, 245, 15, 3906, 2, 8251, 78, 33, 3, 52, 89, 1, 2029, 2, 4056, 736, 10, 717, 184, 614, 431, 2, 728, 184, 614, 790, 60, 106, 286, 2194, 2647, 10589, 681, 329, 1223, 212, 10, 3, 96, 186, 147, 62, 2029, 4713, 11, 49, 1, 49, 1160, 655, 6, 3, 5783, 107, 7, 479, 4056, 1085, 889, 103, 18, 4056, 2960, 6, 2465, 31, 61, 2, 966, 103, 14, 18, 1160, 5095, 4713, 3, 52, 166, 126, 9, 332, 10, 428, 184, 133, 713, 53, 3, 27, 111, 3518, 1, 91, 115, 25, 300, 201, 185, 562, 19, 1096, 2, 118, 601, 185, 562, 19, 696, 11, 288, 9, 2190, 1, 2029, 2, 4056, 3, 967, 287, 1, 88, 215, 478, 286, 1599, 185, 1204, 5873, 34, 595, 185, 739, 19, 179, 2, 5064, 28, 3172, 162, 382, 185, 339, 19, 511, 11, 1279, 137, 4056, 2190, 42, 8, 280, 287, 1, 442, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 6670, 28, 14, 111, 327, 185, 269, 19, 588, 23, 331, 65, 1599, 267, 42, 77, 345, 23, 5064, 15, 25, 2, 3, 1085, 1879, 558, 368, 10, 3, 158, 161, 1042, 464, 9, 46, 1387, 114, 45, 2304, 3, 119, 1, 1160, 5095, 4056, 22, 35, 1091, 1599, 2353, 9, 434, 7, 54, 594, 8, 941, 84, 1022, 44, 47, 35, 2029, 3, 119, 1, 3365, 2, 4056, 8464, 3, 2550, 1, 941, 36, 6, 434, 7, 373, 1800, 23, 3, 877, 1, 89, 2, 926, 1, 8, 2884, 2029, 8, 3465, 206, 1, 1692, 1909, 16, 1493, 198, 3075, 434, 7, 9, 1085]",2210.0,18275894,Reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant patients older 55 years unrelated umbilical cord blood safe effective patients matched related donor,0,0.0

Involved-field radiotherapy before high-dose therapy and autologous stem-cell rescue in diffuse large-cell lymphoma: long-term disease control and toxicity.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-03-10,"To analyze outcome, prognostic factors, and toxicities in patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) who received involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) before high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue (ASCR). Between January 1990 and August 2006, 164 patients with relapsed or refractory DLCL received IFRT at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) before high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR. IFRT was delivered to involved sites measuring more than 5 cm or to sites with residual disease more than 2 cm. Radiotherapy was administered in 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily to a total dose of 30 Gy. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated, and short- and long-term toxicity was assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0). Median follow-up was 60 months (range, 2 to 187 months). Two- and 5-year progression-free survival was 62% and 53%; 2- and 5-year overall survival was 67% and 58%, respectively. Sixty-seven patients relapsed; only 10 patients relapsed completely within the radiotherapy field.

Cancer Res.,2008-04-01,"Epigenetic silencing via aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation of normal genes has been described as a leukemogenic mechanism in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). We hypothesized that MG98, an oligonucleotide antisense to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), could reverse malignant phenotypes by down-regulating DNMT1 and inducing reexpression of hypermethylated genes. This phase I study was conducted to determine a biologically effective dose and describe the safety of MG98 in MDS/AML. Twenty-three patients with MDS (n = 11) and AML (n = 12) were enrolled. Biologically effective dose was defined as the dose at which > or =50% of patients experienced >50% reduction in DNMT1 expression with acceptable toxicity. Escalating doses of MG98 were administered according to two schedules (2-hour i.v. bolus followed by 5-day continuous i.v. infusion every 14 days, or 14-day continuous i.v. infusion every 21 days). DNMT1 down-regulation was observed in 8 patients. However, biologically effective dose was not reached. Reexpression of target genes (P15, WIT1, and ER) was observed in 12 patients but did not correlate with DNMT1 down-regulation. Escalation was stopped due to dose-limiting toxicities (bone pain, nausea, and fever). No objective clinical response was observed. Disease stabilization occurred in 6 (26%) patients. No pharmacodynamic or clinical activity was observed at MG98 doses and schedules administered. Despite this, pursuing DNMT1 down-regulation remains a sound approach for targeting aberrant epigenetics in AML/MDS. Future studies with different formulation and/or doses and schedules will be required to ensure efficient MG98 intracellular uptake and fully evaluate its therapeutic potential.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",4312.0,67.0,Epigenetic silencing aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation normal described leukemogenic mechanism myelodysplastic syndromes MDS acute myeloid leukemias AML hypothesized MG98 oligonucleotide antisense DNA methyltransferase 1 DNMT1 reverse malignant phenotypes down-regulating DNMT1 inducing reexpression hypermethylated phase conducted determine biologically effective dose safety MG98 MDS/AML Twenty-three patients MDS n 11 AML n 12 enrolled Biologically effective dose defined dose =50 patients experienced 50 reduction DNMT1 expression acceptable toxicity Escalating doses MG98 administered according schedules 2-hour i.v bolus followed 5-day continuous i.v infusion 14 days 14-day continuous i.v infusion 21 days DNMT1 down-regulation observed 8 patients biologically effective dose reached Reexpression target P15 WIT1 ER observed 12 patients correlate DNMT1 down-regulation Escalation stopped dose-limiting toxicities bone pain nausea fever objective clinical response observed Disease stabilization occurred 6 26 patients pharmacodynamic clinical activity observed MG98 doses schedules administered Despite pursuing DNMT1 down-regulation remains sound approach targeting aberrant epigenetics AML/MDS Future studies different formulation and/or doses schedules required ensure efficient MG98 intracellular uptake fully evaluate therapeutic potential,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1418, 2077, 847, 1898, 973, 261, 2575, 1, 295, 214, 71, 85, 1027, 22, 8, 13519, 670, 4, 2040, 1223, 2, 286, 533, 2792, 329, 21, 1237, 17, 31269, 35, 4727, 4645, 6, 261, 3747, 14, 7328, 359, 1772, 393, 2618, 20, 1328, 2681, 7328, 2, 1958, 11120, 1, 6936, 214, 26, 124, 70, 45, 10, 426, 6, 223, 8, 2665, 323, 61, 2, 897, 3, 367, 1, 31269, 4, 1223, 329, 737, 169, 7, 5, 1223, 78, 175, 2, 329, 78, 133, 11, 346, 2665, 323, 61, 10, 395, 22, 3, 61, 28, 92, 15, 212, 1, 7, 592, 212, 628, 4, 7328, 55, 5, 1595, 155, 2922, 415, 1, 31269, 11, 468, 768, 6, 100, 2314, 18, 2583, 70, 603, 3604, 370, 20, 33, 218, 1314, 70, 603, 904, 454, 213, 162, 15, 213, 218, 1314, 70, 603, 904, 454, 239, 162, 7328, 1328, 863, 10, 164, 4, 66, 7, 137, 2665, 323, 61, 10, 44, 1300, 11120, 1, 283, 214, 8840, 57003, 2, 516, 10, 164, 4, 133, 7, 84, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 7328, 1328, 863, 1125, 10, 4403, 520, 6, 61, 817, 385, 559, 1218, 2, 2775, 77, 461, 38, 51, 10, 164, 34, 3184, 489, 4, 49, 432, 7, 77, 2424, 15, 38, 128, 10, 164, 28, 31269, 415, 2, 2314, 468, 550, 26, 10692, 7328, 1328, 863, 469, 8, 11475, 353, 9, 529, 1898, 9706, 4, 329, 1223, 508, 94, 5, 338, 3583, 2, 15, 415, 2, 2314, 303, 40, 616, 6, 3478, 2547, 31269, 2087, 1135, 2, 1910, 376, 211, 189, 174]",1675.0,18413836,phase MG98 oligodeoxynucleotide antisense DNA methyltransferase 1 patients high-risk myelodysplasia acute myeloid leukemia,6,0.010471204188481676
Higher doses of lenalidomide are associated with unacceptable toxicity including life-threatening tumor flare in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2008-04-21,"Lenalidomide is a novel therapeutic agent with uncertain mechanism of action that is clinically active in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Application of high (MM) and low (MDS) doses of lenalidomide has been reported to have clinical activity in CLL. Herein, we highlight life-threatening tumor flare when higher doses of lenalidomide are administered to patients with CLL and provide a potential mechanism for its occurrence. Four patients with relapsed CLL were treated with lenalidomide (25 mg/d for 21 days of a 28-day cycle). Serious adverse events including tumor flare and tumor lysis are summarized. In vitro studies examining drug-induced apoptosis and activation of CLL cells were also performed. Four consecutive patients were treated with lenalidomide; all had serious adverse events. Tumor flare was observed in three patients and was characterized by dramatic and painful lymph node enlargement resulting in hospitalization of two patients, with one fatal outcome. Another patient developed sepsis and renal failure. In vitro studies demonstrated lenalidomide-induced B-cell activation (upregulation of CD40 and CD86) corresponding to degree of tumor flare, possibly explaining the tumor flare observation. Lenalidomide administered at 25 mg/d in relapsed CLL is associated with unacceptable toxicity; the rapid onset and adverse clinical effects of tumor flare represent a significant limitation of lenalidomide use in CLL at this dose. Drug-associated B-cell activation may contribute to this adverse event.

Adult Henoch-schönlein purpura in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome and a history of follicular lymphoma.,Cutis,Cutis,2008-02-01,"To understand Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) to better manage patients with the condition. Upon completion of this activity, dermatologists and general practitioners should be able to: 1. Describe the criteria for diagnosing HSP. 2. Explain the association of malignancy and HSP. 3. Discuss the prevalence of HSP in adults. Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving arterioles and venules most commonly in the skin, glomeruli, and gastrointestinal tract. In skin, it is associated with IgA deposition around dermal blood vessels. While an exact cause of HSP has not been elucidated, several processes have been implicated in its development, including infections; drugs; and allergic, rheumatologic, and neoplastic diseases. We present a 57-year-old woman with a history of follicular lymphoma who developed HSP likely associated with myelodysplastic syndrome. This case is clinically significant because the patient was thought to be in remission of her hematologic disease until her skin findings prompted further evaluation.

In this first analysis of data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), encompassing 82% of the US population, we evaluated trends in MDS and CMD incidence, estimated case numbers for the entire United States, and assessed trends in diagnostic recognition and reporting. Based on more than 40 000 observations, average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of MDS and CMD for 2001 through 2003 were 3.3 and 2.1 per 100,000, respectively. Incidence rates increased with age for both MDS and CMD (P < .05) and were highest among whites and non-Hispanics. Based on follow-up data through 2004 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, overall relative 3-year survival rates for MDS and CMD were 45% and 80%, respectively, with males experiencing poorer survival than females. Applying the observed age-specific incidence rates to US Census population estimates, approximately 9700 patients with MDS and 6300 patients with CMD were estimated for the entire United States in 2004. MDS incidence rates significantly increased with calendar year in 2001 through 2004, and only 4% of patients were reported to registries by physicians' offices.

A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent deforolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. Eligible patients were assigned to one of five disease-specific, parallel cohorts and given 12.5 mg deforolimus as a 30-minute infusion once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks. A Simon two-stage design was used for each cohort. Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor response were assessed. Fifty-five patients received deforolimus as follows: cohort 1 23 acute myelogenous leukemia, two myelodysplastic syndrome and one chronic myelogenous leukemia in nonlymphoid blast phase; cohort 2, one acute lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 3, nine agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; cohort 4, eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia; cohort 5, nine mantle cell lymphoma and two T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Most patients were heavily pretreated. Of the 52 evaluable patients, partial responses were noted in five (10%), two of seven agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and three of nine mantle cell lymphoma. Hematologic improvement/stable disease was observed in 21 (40%). Common treatment-related adverse events, which were generally mild and reversible, were mouth sores, fatigue, nausea, and thrombocytopenia. Decreased levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in 9 of 11 acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients after therapy showed mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition by deforolimus. Deforolimus was well-tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies, and antitumor activity was observed. Further investigation of deforolimus alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents is warranted in patients with selected hematologic malignancies.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4282.0,192.0,Deforolimus AP23573 novel non-prodrug rapamycin analogue inhibits mammalian target rapamycin downstream effector phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt nutrient-sensing pathways phase 2 trial conducted determine efficacy safety single-agent deforolimus patients relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies Eligible patients assigned disease-specific parallel cohorts given 12.5 mg deforolimus 30-minute infusion daily 5 days 2 weeks Simon two-stage design cohort Safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics antitumor response assessed Fifty-five patients received deforolimus follows cohort 1 23 acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myelogenous leukemia nonlymphoid blast phase cohort 2 acute lymphocytic leukemia cohort 3 agnogenic myeloid metaplasia cohort 4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cohort 5 mantle lymphoma T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients heavily pretreated 52 evaluable patients partial responses noted 10 seven agnogenic myeloid metaplasia mantle lymphoma Hematologic improvement/stable disease observed 21 40 Common treatment-related adverse events generally mild reversible mouth sores fatigue nausea thrombocytopenia Decreased levels phosphorylated 4E-BP1 9 11 acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients therapy showed mammalian target rapamycin inhibition deforolimus Deforolimus well-tolerated patients heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies antitumor activity observed investigation deforolimus combination therapeutic agents warranted patients selected hematologic malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[19848, 24680, 8, 229, 220, 5227, 1620, 4696, 1576, 3, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 8, 1489, 2070, 1, 3, 3415, 27, 216, 649, 2, 8749, 8350, 460, 8, 124, 18, 160, 10, 426, 6, 223, 3, 209, 2, 367, 1, 226, 420, 19848, 4, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 813, 441, 625, 7, 11, 896, 6, 104, 1, 365, 34, 112, 2755, 736, 2, 447, 133, 33, 81, 19848, 22, 8, 201, 3949, 904, 1059, 391, 9, 33, 162, 454, 18, 244, 8, 7385, 100, 82, 771, 10, 95, 9, 296, 180, 367, 1159, 3587, 2, 579, 51, 11, 275, 1461, 365, 7, 103, 19848, 22, 2962, 180, 14, 382, 286, 2194, 100, 681, 2, 104, 442, 2194, 4, 20180, 3112, 124, 180, 18, 104, 286, 1193, 180, 27, 762, 26059, 533, 6054, 180, 39, 659, 442, 1193, 180, 33, 762, 2757, 31, 2, 100, 102, 31, 2647, 4763, 96, 7, 11, 2447, 2193, 1, 3, 653, 859, 7, 450, 253, 11, 1051, 4, 365, 79, 100, 1, 648, 26059, 533, 6054, 2, 169, 1, 762, 2757, 31, 813, 767, 585, 34, 10, 164, 4, 239, 327, 186, 24, 139, 290, 281, 92, 11, 1228, 1980, 2, 2786, 11, 5831, 45115, 613, 1218, 2, 1340, 340, 148, 1, 2365, 6726, 7949, 4, 83, 1, 175, 286, 2194, 2647, 10589, 681, 7, 50, 36, 224, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 297, 20, 19848, 19848, 10, 149, 421, 4, 7, 5, 2447, 2193, 813, 441, 2, 579, 128, 10, 164, 195, 940, 1, 19848, 279, 2, 4, 150, 5, 127, 189, 183, 16, 1197, 4, 7, 5, 715, 813, 441]",1820.0,18451242,phase 2 clinical trial deforolimus AP23573 MK-8669 novel mammalian target rapamycin inhibitor patients relapsed refractory hematologic malignancies,0,0.0

Phase 1 study of the oral isotype specific histone deacetylase inhibitor MGCD0103 in leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-05-21,"MGCD0103 is an isotype-selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) targeted to isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 11. In a phase 1 study in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), MGCD0103 was administered orally 3 times weekly without interruption. Twenty-nine patients with a median age of 62 years (range, 32-84 years) were enrolled at planned dose levels (20, 40, and 80 mg/m(2)). The majority of patients (76%) had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In all, 24 (83%) of 29 patients had received 1 or more prior chemotherapies (range, 0-5), and 18 (62%) of 29 patients had abnormal cytogenetics. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 60 mg/m(2), with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea observed at higher doses. Three patients achieved a complete bone marrow response (blasts <or= 5%).

"Phase II study of dasatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute and chronic myeloid diseases, including systemic mastocytosis.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2008-06-01,"Molecular characterization of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloproliferative disorders, such as systemic mastocytosis (SM), has provided a clear rationale for investigating novel targeted therapies. The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor dasatinib is 325-fold more potent against Bcr-Abl TK than imatinib in vitro, significantly inhibiting wild-type KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs, and is active against cells carrying the mutant KIT-D816V gene. In this phase 2, open-label study, the efficacy of dasatinib (140 mg/d) was investigated in 67 patients with various Ph- myeloid disorders, including SM (n = 33; 28 KIT-D816V positive). The overall response rate to dasatinib in patients with SM was 33%. Only two patients, one with SM-myelofibrosis and one with SM-chronic eosinophilic leukemia, achieved complete response (elimination of mastocytosis) lasting for 5 and 16 months, respectively. Both patients were negative for KIT-D816V mutation, had low tryptase levels, abnormal WBC counts, and anemia, and had failed prior therapy with erythropoietin. Additional nine SM patients had symptomatic response, lasting 3 to 18+ months. Complete responses were achieved in two other patients (acute myeloid leukemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome). No responses were observed among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and primary myelofibrosis. The majority of adverse events were grade 1/2. These data show that dasatinib therapy may benefit a selected group of SM patients, primarily by improving their symptoms, but it does not eliminate the disease in the patients with KIT-D816V mutation.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4251.0,133.0,Molecular characterization Philadelphia chromosome-negative Ph- chronic myeloproliferative disorders systemic mastocytosis SM provided clear rationale investigating novel targeted therapies tyrosine kinase TK inhibitor dasatinib 325-fold potent Bcr-Abl TK imatinib vitro significantly inhibiting wild-type KIT platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs active carrying KIT-D816V phase 2 open-label efficacy dasatinib 140 mg/d investigated 67 patients Ph- myeloid disorders including SM n 33 28 KIT-D816V positive overall response rate dasatinib patients SM 33 patients SM-myelofibrosis SM-chronic eosinophilic leukemia achieved complete response elimination mastocytosis lasting 5 16 months respectively patients negative KIT-D816V low tryptase levels abnormal WBC counts anemia failed prior therapy erythropoietin Additional SM patients symptomatic response lasting 3 18+ months Complete responses achieved patients acute myeloid leukemia hypereosinophilic syndrome responses observed patients myelodysplastic syndromes primary myelofibrosis majority adverse events grade 1/2 dasatinib therapy benefit selected group SM patients primarily improving symptoms eliminate disease patients KIT-D816V,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[219, 2136, 1, 3006, 1170, 199, 2058, 442, 1997, 225, 22, 403, 7224, 3635, 71, 1052, 8, 885, 1728, 9, 3103, 229, 238, 235, 3, 564, 216, 5067, 230, 1674, 16, 7139, 1116, 80, 1157, 480, 1062, 1425, 5067, 76, 577, 4, 439, 97, 2062, 955, 267, 1164, 2, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 1090, 38624, 2, 16, 544, 480, 37, 2934, 3, 620, 1164, 12643, 145, 4, 26, 124, 18, 1020, 1756, 45, 3, 209, 1, 1674, 3304, 81, 427, 10, 565, 4, 598, 7, 5, 747, 2058, 533, 1997, 141, 3635, 78, 466, 339, 1164, 12643, 109, 3, 63, 51, 116, 6, 1674, 4, 7, 5, 3635, 10, 466, 158, 100, 7, 104, 5, 3635, 4637, 2, 104, 5, 3635, 442, 9757, 513, 236, 51, 3730, 1, 7224, 3443, 9, 33, 2, 245, 53, 106, 110, 7, 11, 199, 9, 1164, 12643, 258, 42, 154, 16910, 148, 1668, 4685, 1911, 2, 1545, 2, 42, 1551, 324, 36, 5, 6266, 402, 762, 3635, 7, 42, 1704, 51, 3443, 27, 6, 203, 53, 236, 253, 11, 513, 4, 100, 127, 7, 286, 533, 2, 13967, 681, 77, 253, 11, 164, 107, 7, 5, 2040, 2, 86, 4637, 3, 686, 1, 290, 281, 11, 88, 14, 18, 46, 74, 514, 17, 1674, 36, 68, 247, 8, 715, 87, 1, 3635, 7, 1561, 20, 1673, 136, 507, 84, 192, 1097, 44, 4964, 3, 34, 4, 3, 7, 5, 1164, 12643, 258]",1533.0,18559612,Phase II dasatinib Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute chronic myeloid diseases including systemic mastocytosis,75,0.13089005235602094

Proposal for a new risk model in myelodysplastic syndrome that accounts for events not considered in the original International Prognostic Scoring System.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-09-01,"Recent studies have highlighted issues with the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) model in relation to the exclusion of many subgroups that now represent a large proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (eg, secondary MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML] with leukocytosis, prior therapy) and its lack of applicability to most patients on investigational programs, because many would have received prior therapies and would have had MDS for a significant length of time. The authors analyzed 1915 patients with MDS who were referred from 1993 to 2005 (including those with CMML, secondary MDS, and MDS with prior therapy). Only 507 patients (26%) had primary MDS without prior therapy (ie, classifiable by the IPSS). Patients were divided randomly into a study group (n = 958) and a test group (n = 957). RESULTS.: A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in the study group identified the following adverse, independent factors as continuous and categoric values (P<.001): poor performance, older age, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased bone marrow blasts, leukocytosis, chromosome 7 or complex (>or=3) abnormalities, and prior transfusions. Cutoffs for anemia, thrombocytopenia and blasts, and cytogenetic subsets were different according to the IPSS. The new MDS prognostic model divided patients into 4 prognostic groups with significantly different outcomes. The model was validated in the test group. Applying the prognostic score of the new model within the 4 IPSS risk groups, overall, and in patients who had primary MDS without prior therapy was found to be highly prognostic in each subset. Applying the IPSS within each of the 4 risk groups of the new MDS model was not found to be prognostic. The new model accounts for duration of MDS and prior therapy.

Myelodysplastic syndromes associated with interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q: clinicopathologic correlations and new insights from the pre-lenalidomide era.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2008-09-01,"To better estimate prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with clonal interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)), we reviewed the medical records of 130 adults with del(5q) MDS seen at our institution over a 15-year period. Overall median survival of this cohort was 9.5 months, shorter than reported in earlier series. The least favorable outcomes are associated with complex cytogenetics, lack of any normal metaphases, normocytic rather than macrocytic erythrocyte indices, and low baseline lymphocyte counts. Lymphopenia but not neutropenia at the time of diagnosis appears to be a new adverse prognostic indicator. Cytogenetic breakpoints defined by G-banded karyotyping correlate poorly with particular disease features.

The prognostic significance of cytokine levels in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-10-01,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and other cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but their prognostic significance in these diseases is unknown. In the current study, the authors assessed the association between serum levels of various cytokines and clinical outcomes in patients with untreated AML or high-risk MDS. Serum levels of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6, IL-10, and endostatin were measured in patients with AML or high-risk MDS who presented for treatment at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from September 1994 through January 2001. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test for correlations with clinical outcomes. Higher TNF-alpha levels were found to correlate with poorer performance status; higher leukocyte counts; higher levels of beta2-microglobulin, creatinine, uric acid, and alkaline phosphatase; lower levels of creatinine clearance and albumin; baseline infection; and M4-M5 AML subtypes. TNF-alpha levels <10 pg/mL were associated with higher rates of complete remission (P = .003), survival (P = .0003), and event-free survival (EFS) (P = .0009). However, on multivariate analyses, TNF-alpha level > or =10 pg/mL was not found to be an independent factor predicting clinical outcomes, but became statistically significant when leukocyte count was excluded from the models. The other cytokines were not found to be predictive of clinical outcomes.

The outcomes for these patients have been poor historically compared to people who develop de novo AML. The spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities in t-AML is similar to de novo AML, but the frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype or deletion or loss of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, is considerably higher in t-AML. Survival varies according to cytogenetic risk group in t-AML patients, with better outcomes being observed in those with favorable-risk karyotypes. Treatment recommendations should be based on performance status and karyotype.

The percentage of older patients who are receiving unrelated donor transplants is increasing; currently over 1 in 10 adult transplant recipients is over the age of 60 years. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was previously the most common diagnosis for unrelated donor transplantation, but it now comprises less than 10% of transplants for adult recipients. Transplants for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) all outnumber CML.

Therapeutic advances in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome over the past 40 years.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-10-01,"Major therapeutic progress has been accomplished in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) over the past 40 years, which may not be fully appreciated by the larger medical community. The objective of this review was to briefly highlight the treatment breakthroughs in leukemia and MDS. Therapeutic progress happened through better understanding of disease pathophysiologies and rational development of targeted agents, like imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and through astute, empirical discoveries in the clinic, like all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and chlorodeoxyadenosine in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Today, the 5- to 10-year survival rates in patients with APL and HCL exceed 80%. In patients with CML, imatinib therapy has been associated with estimated 5- to 7-year survival rates from 85% to 90%. In patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, modern intensive regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates from 20% up to 40%. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemoimmunotherapy recently produced high rates of quality responses and improved long-term outcome. In younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 5-year survival rates range from 40% to 50%, although elderly AML remains a therapeutic challenge. In patients with MDS, it was recently demonstrated that epigenetic therapy with hypomethylating agents improved survival.

Single-agent lenalidomide induces complete remission of acute myeloid leukemia in patients with isolated trisomy 13.,Blood,Blood,2008-09-29,"Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) frequently fail chemotherapy due to refractory disease, relapse, or toxicity. Among older AML patients (age > 60 years), there are few long-term survivors. Lenalidomide is a candidate for study in AML based on its clinical activity in a related disorder, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with the 5q- chromosomal abnormality.

Demethylating agents in myeloid malignancies.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2008-11-01,"Two demethylating agents are approved in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): 5-azacitidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (decitabine). These drugs are structurally related and induce DNA hypomethylation. Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing. It is proposed that hypomethylating agents work by inducing reexpression of epigenetically silenced genes. Here, we provide an up-to-date summary of the clinical experience with these drugs. 5-Azacitidine and decitabine were approved in the United States based on clinical responses, but no effect on survival was documented. Recent results from a phase III study have indicated that treatment of patients with higher risk MDS with 5-azacitidine results in significant improvement in overall survival. Results of a randomized survival study of decitabine should be available in 2008. Reports of combination epigenetic therapies (a hypomethylating agent with a histone deacetylase inhibitor) indicate that these have significant activity in patients with MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia. Randomized studies are testing the concept that the combinations are superior to single-agent therapy. Demethylating agents are the standard of care for patients with higher risk MDS and the only agent known to improve the natural history of MDS.

Long-term outcomes to fludarabine and rituximab in Waldenström macroglobulinemia.,Blood,Blood,2008-11-17,"We report the long-term outcome of a multicenter, prospective study examining fludarabine and rituximab in Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). WM patients with less than 2 prior therapies were eligible. Intended therapy consisted of 6 cycles (25 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days) of fludarabine and 8 infusions (375 mg/m(2) per week) of rituximab. A total of 43 patients were enrolled. Responses were: complete response (n = 2), very good partial response (n = 14), partial response (n = 21), and minor response (n = 4), for overall and major response rates of 95.3% and 86.0%, respectively. Median time to progression for all patients was 51.2 months and was longer for untreated patients (P = .017) and those achieving at least a very good partial response (P = .049). Grade 3 or higher toxicities included neutropenia (n = 27), thrombocytopenia (n = 7), and pneumonia (n = 6), including 2 patients who died of non-Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. With a median follow-up of 40.3 months, we observed 3 cases of transformation to aggressive lymphoma and 3 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia.

Treatment options for relapse are generally limited and can include disease-specific chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Additional relapse-directed therapies that are available for allogeneic HCT recipients include withdrawal of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusion. Selected patients can be offered a second transplant procedure. Newer strategies to eliminate minimal residual disease and, in allogeneic HCT recipients, to augment the graft-versus-tumor effect are needed for patients who are at high risk for relapse after HCT. Second cancers after HCT include post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, hematologic malignancies and new solid cancers. The incidence of second solid cancers continues to rise without a plateau with increasing follow up of HCT survivors. Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia are almost exclusively seen in autologous HCT recipients while post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders complicate recipients of allogeneic HCT.

We performed a case-control study of the outcomes of patients who were hepatitis C virus seropositive at the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (N=31). Patients positive for hepatitis C virus were considered candidates for stem cell transplantation only if they had no significant evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Matched controls (N=31) were seronegative for viral hepatitides and were paired according to age, diagnosis, disease stage, conditioning regimen and donor type. We also compared the hepatitis C virus seropositive patients to all seronegative patients (all controls, N=1800) transplanted during the same period, to adjust for other confounding effects. The median age of the seropositive patients was 49 (range 26-72); 15 had acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 had chronic myeloid leukemia/myeloproliferative disease, 6 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2 myeloma, 1 acute lymphocytic leukemia and 1 Hodgkin's lymphoma; 61% had poor risk disease; 68% had related donors; 68% received reduced intensity conditioning; 7 patients had mildly abnormal alanine transaminase levels (all less than three times the upper limit of normal) and 1 patient had minimally elevated bilirubin. These characteristics were similar to those of the matched control group. Median overall survival was 3, 18 and 20 months, and 1-year survival was 29%, 56% and 56%, in the hepatitis C virus, matched and all controls groups, respectively (hazard ratio for death 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.9-5.6, p<0.001 in multivariate analysis). Non-relapse mortality at 1 year was 43%, 24% and 23%, respectively (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.1, p<0.01). Disease progression and graft-versus-host disease rates were comparable.

Reduced risk of secondary leukemia with fewer cycles of dose-intensive induction chemotherapy in patients with neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-07-01,"We report a prospective study of secondary leukemia (SL)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in neuroblastoma (NB) patients treated with > or =5 cycles of dose-intensive chemotherapy. NB patients received induction with high-dose cyclophosphamide (4,200 mg/m(2))-doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2))-vincristine (cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, 8), and high-dose cisplatin (200 mg/m(2))-etoposide (600 mg/m(2)) (cycles 3, 5, 7). Bone marrow was examined every 1-3 months for > or =36 months, with inclusion of extensive chromosomal studies 1-3 months post-induction and 1-2x/year thereafter. One hundred eight four patients received 5 (n = 76), 6 (n = 45), 7 (n = 59), or 8 (n = 4) cycles. Eight patients developed SL/MDS (only one each in the 5- and 6-cycle groups), at 12-50 months, including two cases detected in surveillance studies. Among 108 patients who received > or =6 cycles, the 5-year cumulative incidence was 7.1% (95% CI: 2%, 12.2%), versus 0% among 54 patients who received 5 cycles without maintenance oral etoposide. Five-year cumulative incidences were 1.46%, 2.28%, and 8.47% among patients in the 5-, 6-, and 7-cycle groups, with fewer cycles having a significantly lower risk (P = 0.048).

Therapy for older AML patients: the role of novel agents and allogeneic stem cell transplant.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2008-11-01,"The development of novel therapeutics in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by the need to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity. Clearly, elderly patients with AML represent a highly heterogeneous group, based on a wide array of disease- and patient-specific characteristics. Therefore, novel treatment strategies aimed at overcoming specific biologic modifiers of disease resistance will be paramount to successful therapy for some, whereas in others, the ability to administer a low-toxicity regimen on a chronic basis to achieve disease control may prove beneficial, perhaps even in the absence of complete responses. In addition, identifying genomic and proteomic expression patterns using an individual's unique neoplastic clone will likely optimize the ability to predict responders to novel therapies and identify new and relevant therapeutic targets. The development of reduced-intensity preparative regimens for allogeneic transplants has allowed physicians and patients to explore the option of long-term disease control.

Pathol.,2009-03-01,"We describe 9 patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) who also had a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). There were 6 men and 3 women with a median age of 60 years (range, 25-74 years). All patients had anemia at initial examination, 7 had neutropenia, and 5 had thrombocytopenia. The median absolute lymphocyte count was 1,300/microL (1.3 x 10(9)/L; range, 700-3,600/microL [0.7-3.6 x 10(9)/L]). Immunophenotypic analysis showed a CD8+ T-cell population, and molecular analysis showed monoclonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in every case. The MDS was classified as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD, n = 5), refractory anemia (n = 2), RCMD with ringed sideroblasts (n = 1), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1). We compared the data for these patients with T-LGL/MDS with a group that had only T-LGL. The median hemoglobin level and absolute lymphocyte count were lower in patients with T-LGL/MDS (P < .05).

A phase 2 study of concurrent fludarabine and rituximab for the treatment of marginal zone lymphomas.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2009-03-30,"The marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) are a recently defined group of related diseases that probably arise from a common cell of origin, the marginal zone B cell. Data on therapy for subtypes other than gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has been largely limited to retrospective case series. This prospective phase 2 study of fludarabine and rituximab for the treatment of marginal zone lymphomas enrolled 26 patients, 14 with nodal MZL, eight with MALT lymphomas and four with splenic MZL; 81% were receiving initial systemic therapy. Only 58% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37-77%] of patients completed the planned six cycles, due to significant haematological, infectious and allergic toxicity. Four late toxic deaths occurred due to infections [15% (95% CI 4.3-35%)], two related to delayed bone marrow aplasia and two related to myelodysplastic syndrome. Nonetheless, the overall response rate was 85% (95% CI 65-96%), with 54% complete responses. The progression-free survival at 3.1 years of follow-up is 79.5% (95% CI 63-96%). We conclude that, although concurrent fludarabine and rituximab given at this dose and schedule is a highly effective regimen in the treatment of MZLs, the significant haematological and infectious toxicity observed both during and after therapy is prohibitive in this patient population, emphasizing the need to study MZLs as a separate entity.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3949.0,62.0,marginal zone lymphomas MZLs recently defined group related diseases probably arise common origin marginal zone B therapy subtypes gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma largely limited retrospective case series prospective phase 2 fludarabine rituximab treatment marginal zone lymphomas enrolled 26 patients 14 nodal MZL MALT lymphomas splenic MZL 81 receiving initial systemic therapy 58 95 confidence interval CI 37-77 patients completed planned cycles significant haematological infectious allergic toxicity late toxic deaths occurred infections 15 95 CI 4.3-35 related delayed bone marrow aplasia related myelodysplastic syndrome Nonetheless overall response rate 85 95 CI 65-96 54 complete responses progression-free survival 3.1 years follow-up 79.5 95 CI 63-96 conclude concurrent fludarabine rituximab given dose schedule highly effective regimen treatment MZLs significant haematological infectious toxicity observed therapy prohibitive patient population emphasizing need MZLs separate entity,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 3450, 3614, 1557, 26803, 32, 8, 761, 395, 87, 1, 139, 1342, 17, 4061, 3043, 29, 8, 186, 31, 1, 1938, 3, 3450, 3614, 132, 31, 74, 23, 36, 9, 814, 127, 76, 2713, 41, 2303, 246, 8273, 71, 85, 1733, 383, 6, 459, 473, 988, 26, 482, 124, 18, 45, 1, 2027, 2, 855, 9, 3, 24, 1, 3450, 3614, 1557, 346, 432, 7, 213, 5, 779, 8277, 659, 5, 8273, 1557, 2, 294, 5, 5237, 8277, 865, 11, 357, 388, 403, 36, 158, 717, 48, 307, 268, 58, 567, 849, 1, 7, 781, 3, 1465, 437, 410, 520, 6, 93, 5143, 3398, 2, 7465, 155, 294, 807, 1812, 1043, 489, 520, 6, 1875, 167, 48, 58, 39, 27, 465, 100, 139, 6, 1612, 581, 12307, 2, 100, 139, 6, 681, 4648, 3, 63, 51, 116, 10, 772, 48, 58, 556, 921, 5, 667, 236, 253, 3, 91, 115, 25, 28, 27, 14, 60, 1, 166, 126, 16, 842, 33, 48, 58, 676, 921, 21, 2060, 17, 242, 750, 2027, 2, 855, 447, 28, 26, 61, 2, 1055, 16, 8, 561, 323, 477, 4, 3, 24, 1, 26803, 3, 93, 5143, 2, 3398, 155, 164, 110, 190, 2, 50, 36, 16, 10784, 4, 26, 69, 266, 6826, 3, 594, 6, 45, 26803, 22, 8, 2282, 2983]",1313.0,19344412,phase 2 concurrent fludarabine rituximab treatment marginal zone lymphomas,52,0.09075043630017451

Elevated AF1q expression is a poor prognostic marker for adult acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal cytogenetics.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2009-05-01,"Nearly half of the patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia have normal cytogenetics (NC-AML) and are classified as intermediate risk, but their 5-year overall survival (OS) ranges from 24 to 42%. Therefore, molecular biomarkers to identify poor-risk patients are needed. Elevated AF1q expression in the absence of specific poor cytogenetics is associated with poor outcomes in pediatric patients with AML and adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. We examined AF1q expression in 290 patients with NC-AML. We found that patients with low AF1q (n = 73) expression (AF1q(low)) have better OS (P = 0.026), disease-free survival (P = 0.1), and complete remission rate (P = 0.06) when compared with patients with high AF1q expression (AF1q(high) n = 217).

Cancer Res.,2009-06-09,"Two nucleoside inhibitors of DNA methylation, azacitidine and decitabine, are now standard of care for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome, a deadly form of leukemia. These old drugs, developed as cytotoxic agents and nearly abandoned decades ago were resurrected by the renewed interest in DNA methylation. They have now provided proof of principle for epigenetic therapy, the final chapter in the long saga to provide legitimacy to the field of epigenetics in cancer. But challenges remain; we don't understand precisely how or why the drugs work or stop working after an initial response. Extending these promising findings to solid tumors faces substantial hurdles from drug uptake to clinical trial design. We do not know yet how to select patients for this therapy and how to move it from life extension to cure.

Early epigenetic changes and DNA damage do not predict clinical response in an overlapping schedule of 5-azacytidine and entinostat in patients with myeloid malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2009-06-22,"Sequential administration of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the mechanism behind their clinical efficacy remains controversial. In this study, the methylation dynamics of 4 TSGs (p15(INK4B), CDH-1, DAPK-1, and SOCS-1) were studied in sequential bone marrow samples from 30 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who completed a minimum of 4 cycles of therapy with 5-azacytidine and entinostat. Reversal of promoter methylation after therapy was observed in both clinical responders and nonresponders across all genes. There was no association between clinical response and either baseline methylation or methylation reversal in the bone marrow or purified CD34(+) population, nor was there an association with change in gene expression. Transient global hypomethylation was observed in samples after treatment but was not associated with clinical response. Induction of histone H3/H4 acetylation and the DNA damage-associated variant histone gamma-H2AX was observed in peripheral blood samples across all dose cohorts. In conclusion, methylation reversal of candidate TSGs during cycle 1 of therapy was not predictive of clinical response to combination ""epigenetic"" therapy.

Reduced-toxicity conditioning therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for acute leukemia.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2009-06-01,"We hypothesized that standardized systemic drug delivery would improve treatment safety and provide better leukemia control. We therefore developed an intravenous busulfan formulation and combined it with fludarabine instead of cyclophosphamide in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We used a Bayesian method to compare the outcomes of 67 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who received intravenous busulfan-cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) with 148 subsequent AML/MDS patients who received busulfan-fludarabine (Bu-Flu). The groups had comparable pretreatment characteristics, except that the Bu-Flu patients were older, more often had unrelated donors and had a shorter follow-up. A greatly improved outcome in the Bu-Flu group is unlikely to be explained by improved supportive care during this time period. Overall, the data support replacing BuCy2 with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with Bu-Flu with or without rabbit-ATG for AML or MDS. We further suggest that the high level of safety and fast recovery from conditioning therapy-related side effects after the Bu-Flu regimen makes it a suitable platform technology for testing additional adjuncts for improved posttransplant immune recovery and long-term disease control in patients who are at high risk of rapidly recurrent disease after alloSCT. The extremely low one-year treatment-related mortality as well as high overall and event-free survival of patients in the Bu-Flu group indicate that it is time to revisit the value of alloSCT compared with conventional maintenance chemotherapy for patients in first complete remission of AML/MDS.",Comparative Study,3886.0,14.0,hypothesized standardized systemic drug delivery improve treatment safety provide better leukemia control developed intravenous busulfan formulation combined fludarabine instead cyclophosphamide preparation allogeneic stem transplantation alloSCT Bayesian compare outcomes 67 acute myeloid leukemia AML /myelodysplastic syndrome MDS patients received intravenous busulfan-cyclophosphamide BuCy2 148 subsequent AML/MDS patients received busulfan-fludarabine Bu-Flu groups comparable pretreatment characteristics Bu-Flu patients older unrelated donors shorter follow-up greatly improved outcome Bu-Flu group unlikely explained improved supportive care time period Overall support replacing BuCy2 antithymocyte globulin ATG Bu-Flu rabbit-ATG AML MDS suggest high level safety fast recovery conditioning therapy-related effects Bu-Flu regimen makes suitable platform technology testing additional adjuncts improved posttransplant immune recovery long-term disease control patients high risk rapidly recurrent disease alloSCT extremely low one-year treatment-related mortality high overall event-free survival patients Bu-Flu group indicate time revisit value alloSCT compared conventional maintenance chemotherapy patients complete remission AML/MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 1237, 17, 1670, 403, 234, 989, 688, 401, 24, 367, 2, 377, 380, 182, 21, 673, 276, 35, 1262, 3906, 3583, 2, 397, 192, 5, 2027, 3496, 1, 1112, 4, 4824, 9, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 7253, 21, 95, 8, 5032, 596, 6, 932, 3, 123, 1, 598, 286, 533, 329, 10589, 681, 1223, 7, 54, 103, 1262, 3906, 1112, 27967, 5, 4647, 706, 329, 1223, 7, 54, 103, 3906, 2027, 3667, 5119, 3, 271, 42, 1279, 1194, 374, 2187, 17, 3, 3667, 5119, 7, 11, 434, 80, 629, 42, 2092, 2344, 2, 42, 8, 985, 166, 126, 8, 3510, 231, 228, 4, 3, 3667, 5119, 87, 16, 3568, 6, 40, 3672, 20, 231, 1877, 165, 190, 26, 98, 727, 63, 3, 74, 538, 9574, 27967, 5, 15, 187, 11016, 7819, 7168, 5, 3667, 5119, 5, 15, 187, 11079, 7168, 9, 329, 15, 1223, 21, 195, 309, 17, 3, 64, 301, 1, 367, 2, 5830, 1602, 29, 1933, 36, 139, 1152, 176, 50, 3, 3667, 5119, 477, 4677, 192, 8, 2884, 2243, 2033, 9, 471, 402, 13885, 9, 231, 7346, 250, 1602, 2, 319, 337, 34, 182, 4, 7, 54, 32, 28, 64, 43, 1, 1755, 387, 34, 50, 7253, 3, 2938, 154, 104, 111, 24, 139, 282, 22, 149, 22, 64, 63, 2, 774, 115, 25, 1, 7, 4, 3, 3667, 5119, 87, 1008, 17, 192, 16, 98, 6, 26846, 3, 549, 1, 7253, 72, 5, 809, 1146, 56, 9, 7, 4, 157, 236, 734, 1, 329, 1223]",1626.0,19561406,Reduced-toxicity conditioning therapy allogeneic stem transplantation acute leukemia,25,0.04363001745200698

Preparative regimens included myeloablative (MA; N = 611), reduced-intensity (RI; N = 160), and nonmyeloablative (NMA; N = 161). For MA recipients, CD34(+) counts greater than 3.8 x 10(6)/kg improved neutrophil and platelet engraftment, whereas improved overall survival (OS) and reduced transplant-related mortality (TRM) were seen for all preparative regimens when CD34(+) cell doses exceeded 4.5 x 10(6)/kg. Higher infused doses of CD34(+) cell dose did not result in increased rates of either acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three-year OS and disease-free survival (DFS) of recipients of MA, RI, and NMA approaches were similar (33%, 35%, and 32% OS; 33%, 30%, and 29% DFS, respectively). In summary, recipients of URD-PBSC HCT receiving preparative regimens differing in intensity experienced similar survival. Higher CD34(+) cell doses resulted in more rapid engraftment, less TRM, and better 3-year OS (39% versus 25%, MA, P = .004; 38% versus 21% RI/NMA, P = .004) but did not increase the risk of GVHD.

Pooled vorinostat clinical trial data from 498 patients with solid or hematologic malignancies show that vorinostat was well tolerated as monotherapy or combination therapy. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) associated with monotherapy (n = 341) were fatigue (61.9%), nausea (55.7%), diarrhea (49.3%), anorexia (48.1%), and vomiting (32.8%), and Grade 3/4 drug-related AEs included fatigue (12.0%), thrombocytopenia (10.6%), dehydration (7.3%), and decreased platelet count (5.3%). The most common drug-related AEs observed with vorinostat in combination therapy (n = 157, most of whom received vorinostat 400 mg qd for 14 days) were nausea (48.4%), diarrhea (40.8%), fatigue (34.4%), vomiting (31.2%), and anorexia (20.4%), with the majority of AEs being Grade 2 or less. In Phase I trials, combinations with vorinostat were generally well tolerated and preliminary evidence of anticancer activity as monotherapy or in combination with other systemic therapies has been observed across a range of malignancies. Ongoing and planned studies will further evaluate the potential of vorinostat in combination therapy, including combinations with radiation, in patients with diverse malignancy types, including non-small-cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome.",Evaluation Study,3830.0,108.0,Vorinostat Zolinza histone deacetylase inhibitor approved Food Drug Administration October 2006 treatment cutaneous manifestations patients cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progressive persistent recurrent disease following systemic therapies review summarizes evidence use vorinostat solid hematologic malignancies collated tolerability vorinostat clinical trial program Pooled vorinostat clinical trial 498 patients solid hematologic malignancies vorinostat tolerated monotherapy combination therapy commonly reported drug-related adverse events AEs associated monotherapy n 341 fatigue 61.9 nausea 55.7 diarrhea 49.3 anorexia 48.1 vomiting 32.8 Grade 3/4 drug-related AEs included fatigue 12.0 thrombocytopenia 10.6 dehydration 7.3 decreased platelet count 5.3 common drug-related AEs observed vorinostat combination therapy n 157 received vorinostat 400 mg qd 14 days nausea 48.4 diarrhea 40.8 fatigue 34.4 vomiting 31.2 anorexia 20.4 majority AEs Grade 2 Phase trials combinations vorinostat generally tolerated preliminary evidence anticancer activity monotherapy combination systemic therapies observed range malignancies Ongoing planned studies evaluate potential vorinostat combination therapy including combinations radiation patients diverse malignancy types including non-small-cell lung glioblastoma multiforme multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2371, 26641, 8, 1508, 2732, 230, 10, 850, 20, 3, 843, 1773, 2, 234, 634, 4, 2551, 1324, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1486, 4282, 4, 7, 5, 1486, 102, 31, 54, 47, 1014, 1882, 15, 387, 34, 23, 15, 366, 100, 403, 235, 26, 206, 2869, 241, 23, 3, 119, 1, 2371, 4, 537, 2, 813, 441, 2, 20341, 1543, 74, 29, 3, 2371, 38, 160, 1243, 1830, 2371, 38, 160, 74, 29, 8928, 7, 5, 537, 15, 813, 441, 514, 17, 2371, 10, 149, 421, 22, 1411, 15, 150, 36, 3, 96, 841, 210, 234, 139, 290, 281, 1477, 41, 5, 1411, 78, 4065, 11, 613, 713, 83, 1218, 614, 67, 1172, 739, 27, 3373, 576, 14, 2, 1966, 531, 66, 2, 88, 27, 39, 234, 139, 1477, 159, 613, 133, 13, 1340, 79, 49, 5414, 67, 27, 2, 340, 1596, 1276, 33, 27, 3, 96, 186, 234, 139, 1477, 164, 5, 2371, 4, 150, 36, 78, 5311, 96, 1, 953, 103, 2371, 1524, 81, 5419, 9, 213, 162, 11, 1218, 576, 39, 1172, 327, 66, 613, 562, 39, 1966, 456, 18, 2, 3373, 179, 39, 5, 3, 686, 1, 1477, 486, 88, 18, 15, 299, 4, 124, 70, 143, 1247, 5, 2371, 11, 1228, 149, 421, 2, 1676, 241, 1, 1475, 128, 22, 1411, 15, 4, 150, 5, 127, 403, 235, 71, 85, 164, 716, 8, 184, 1, 441, 942, 2, 1465, 94, 303, 195, 376, 3, 174, 1, 2371, 4, 150, 36, 141, 1247, 5, 121, 4, 7, 5, 1867, 710, 630, 141, 220, 302, 31, 12, 996, 3238, 232, 2, 681]",1686.0,19635146,Vorinostat solid hematologic malignancies,2,0.0034904013961605585
Cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin in bone marrow blasts of acute myeloid leukemia patients is not completely concordant with NPM1 mutation and is not predictive of prognosis.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-10-01,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene mutations are reported to predict a favorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Aberrant cytoplasmic localization of nucleophosmin (NPM) protein is reported be a surrogate for NPM1 gene mutation. Using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, we assessed for NPM (clone 376) expression in formalin-fixed, formic acid-decalcified bone marrow biopsy specimens. DNA sequencing of exon 12 of NPM1 gene was performed in 104 patients. The study included 252 AML patients: 192 de novo AML, 33 AML preceded by either myelodysplastic syndrome or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 27 therapy-related AML. The median age was 62 years and 115 patients were <or=60 years old. All patients received intensive chemotherapy. Cytoplasmic NPM was detected in 59 of 252 (23%) patients, including 48 of 192 (25%) de novo AML and 33 of 94 (35%) with a normal karyotype. DNA sequencing identified NPM1 mutations in 30 of 38 cases with cytoplasmic NPM and 10 of 66 cases with nuclear NPM. Cytoplasmic NPM was associated with young patient age (P=.024), FLT3/ITD (P=.005), CD34 negative blasts (P<.001), high peripheral blood blast count (P=.041), and high serum albumin level (P=.028). No statistical differences in overall or event-free survival were found on the basis of NPM localization. Similar results were obtained in patients<or=60 years old with normal karyotype and wild-type FLT3 (P=.768). IHC assessment for NPM localization did not predict prognosis in this patient cohort.

MDS and secondary AML display unique patterns and abundance of aberrant DNA methylation.,Blood,Blood,2009-08-03,"Increasing evidence shows aberrant hypermethylation of genes occurring in and potentially contributing to pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Several of these diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), are responsive to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. To determine the extent of promoter hypermethylation in such tumors, we compared the distribution of DNA methylation of 14 000 promoters in MDS and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients enrolled in a phase 1 trial of 5-azacytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat against de novo AML patients and normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells. The MDS and secondary AML patients displayed more extensive aberrant DNA methylation involving thousands of genes than did the normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells or de novo AML blasts. Aberrant methylation in MDS and secondary AML tended to affect particular chromosomal regions, occurred more frequently in Alu-poor genes, and included prominent involvement of genes involved in the WNT and MAPK signaling pathways. DNA methylation was also measured at days 15 and 29 after the first treatment cycle. DNA methylation was reversed at day 15 in a uniform manner throughout the genome, and this effect persisted through day 29, even without continuous administration of the study drugs.

Moderate renal function impairment does not affect outcomes of reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2009-09-01,"Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after reduced-intensity allogeneic transplants is likely to be influenced by abnormalities in renal function. We studied 141 patients diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (n = 131) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 10) who underwent allogeneic transplantation with fludarabine (Flu)/melphalan (Mel)-based regimens and hypothesized that moderate to mild renal function impairment increases NRM in this setting. Flu dose consisted of 25-30 mg/m(2) for 4 days and Mel dose was 100-180 mg/m(2). Donors were HLA-compatible siblings (n = 69) and matched unrelated donors (n = 72). Disease status at transplantation was complete remission (n = 56, 40%) or active disease (n = 85, 60%). The influence of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured before transplantation on outcomes was analyzed. GFR was estimated by both the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and the modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) equations, using the creatinine value obtained prior to starting chemotherapy. Evaluated outcomes were overall survival (OS), NRM, and treatment-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 and 1-year posttransplantation. Median age was 55 years (range: 21-74 years); 59% of the patients were male. Estimated GFR by CG was > or =90 for 45 (32%), 60-89 for 78 (55%), and <60 for 18 (13%) patients. When estimated by MDRD, GFR was > or =90 for 65 (46%), 60-89 from 66 (47%), and <60 for 10 (7%) patients.

Pilot study of targeted skeletal radiation therapy for bone-only metastatic breast cancer.,Clinical breast cancer,Clin. Breast Cancer,2009-08-01,"Bone-targeted radiation therapy is an attractive strategy for addressing bone disease with minimal systemic toxicity. This pilot study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of (166)Holmium (Ho)-DOTMP for irradiating malignant cells and adjacent marrow in women with bone-only metastatic breast cancer. Subjects included 6 women aged < or = 65 years with breast cancer and bone-only metastases at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The activity of (166)Ho-DOTMP was calculated to deliver a therapeutic absorbed dose of 22 Gy (n = 3) or 28 Gy (n = 3) to the marrow. Treatment was followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to circumvent the anticipated myelosuppresion. Median follow-up time was 40 months. All subjects showed prompt hematologic recovery. No patient experienced grade 3/4 acute toxicity aside from myelosuppression. Two patients developed hemorrhagic cystitis 2 years after therapy. One patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome but was found to have had pre-existing trisomy 8. Two patients remained progression free without evidence of disease for more than 6 years. Five women experienced disease relapse (4 at extraosseous sites) and died of progressive disease. Median time to progression was 10.4 months. The approach of bone-targeted radiation therapy with (166)Ho-DOTMP had an acceptable toxicity profile, and sustained complete response was obtained in 2 of 6 patients.

Superior outcome with hypomethylating therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities.,Cancer,Cancer,2009-12-01,"Outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (excluding del 5[q]) has been poor, with <10% of patients alive at 2 years. The authors investigated whether treatment with hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine/decitabine) leads to an improved outcome. Between January 2004 and December 2007, 81 patients (37 [46%] with AML [>or=20% blasts]; 44 [54%] with high-risk MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their initial therapy. These included 68 patients with complex (>or=3) abnormalities and 13 with <3 aberrations. During the same period, 151 patients (126 with AML, 25 with MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (128 complex, 23 noncomplex) were treated with intensive chemotherapy (including cytarabine-based regimens in 72% and other regimes in 28%). The median ages for the 2 groups were 66 years and 61 years, respectively (ranges, 37-85 years and 19-89 years). Thirty-three (41%) patients in the hypomethylating group achieved complete remission (CR) versus 53 (35%) in the chemotherapy group (P=.395). With a median follow-up of 51 weeks (range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 weeks (range, 5-128 weeks), 22 of 33 patients in the hypomethylating group and 33 of 53 patients in the chemotherapy group had developed disease recurrence. The median CR duration was 45 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively (P=.153). The overall survival was superior for the hypomethylating group compared with the chemotherapy group (P=.019).

Oncol.,2009-11-01,"Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) is a long-term complication of pediatric cancer. We retrospectively studied pediatric t-MDS/AML patients treated at MD Anderson from 1975 to 2007. We also compared those patients to pediatric patients with de novo MDS/AML during this time interval. Among 2589 children with cancer treated at MD Anderson, we identified 22 patients with t-MDS/AML. Patients with t-MDS/AML had a median age of 14 years. There was a male and Hispanic predominance. The most common primary malignancies were osteosarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The median latency period was 4.1 years. Three patients received supportive care only. Group 1 (n=5) underwent stem cell transplantation without induction chemotherapy. Group 2 (n=5) patients received AML-type chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant postremission (n=5). Group 3 (n=4) received a stem cell transplant as salvage therapy. The respective 2-year survival rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 20%, 40%, and 25% (P=0.85). Patients with de novo AML were younger (P=0.001) and higher rates of complete remission (P=0.03), and survival (P<0.0001).

Progressive chromatin repression and promoter methylation of CTNNA1 associated with advanced myeloid malignancies.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2009-10-13,"Complete loss or deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is frequent in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The putative gene(s) deleted and responsible for the pathogenesis of these poor prognosis hematologic disorders remain controversial. This study is a comprehensive analysis of previously implicated and novel genes for epigenetic inactivation in AML and MDS. In 146 AML cases, methylation of CTNNA1 was frequent, and more common in AML patients with 5q deletion (31%) than those without 5q deletion (14%), whereas no methylation of other 5q genes was observed. In 31 MDS cases, CTNNA1 methylation was only found in high-risk MDS (>or=RAEB2), but not in low-risk MDS (<RAEB2), indicating that CTNNA1 methylation might be important in the transformation of MDS to AML. CTNNA1 expression was lowest in AML/MDS patients with CTNNA1 methylation, although reduced expression was found in some patients without promoter methylation. Repressive chromatin marks (H3K27me3) at the promoter were identified in CTNNA1-repressed AML cell lines and primary leukemias, with the most repressive state correlating with DNA methylation.

Outcomes of hematologic malignancies after unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation according to place of residence.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2009-10-30,"Studies suggest that patients who live in rural areas may have worse clinical outcomes compared with patients living in urban areas. We studied whether place of residence (rural versus urban) is associated with clinical outcomes of patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who received an unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients' residential ZIP code at the time of transplant was used to determine rural or urban designation based on the Rural Urban Commuting Codes. The study included 6140 patients reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) from 121 U.S. HCT centers: 1179 (19%) came from rural areas, whereas 4961 (81%) came from urban areas. Rural and urban patients were similar in patient-, disease-, and transplant-related characteristics aside from household income and distance traveled to the HCT center. After adjusting for income and other significant patient, disease, and transplant-related variables, the risk of overall mortality between patients residing in rural and urban areas were not statistically significant (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.93-1.10, P = .74).

Evolving strategies in the treatment of MDS and AML.,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,2009-08-01,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by a hyperproliferative bone marrow, cellular dysplasia, and ineffective hematopoiesis. This heterogeneous malignancy is composed of several subtypes, the classification of which has evolved over several years. The treatment of MDS involves improving patient survival and quality of life while decreasing the likelihood of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In addition to supportive care with transfusions and hematopoietic growth factors as well as stem cell transplantation, three chemotherapeutic agents have been approved to treat MDS--lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine. In addition, multiple agents and novel combinations are currently in development to treat both MDS AML. Several clinical studies which have investigated these therapeutic approaches, as well as the incorporation of new tools used in the diagnosis of MDS, have been published since the 2008 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition, and are discussed here.

Cytogenetic and genetic pathways in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia.,Chemico-biological interactions,Chem. Biol. Interact.,2009-12-01,"Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/t-AML) are late complications of cytotoxic therapy used in the treatment of malignant diseases. The most common subtype of t-AML ( approximately 75% of cases) develops after exposure to alkylating agents, and is characterized by loss or deletion of chromosome 5 and/or 7 [-5/del(5q), -7/del(7q)], and a poor outcome (median survival 8 months). In the University of Chicago's series of 386 patients with t-MDS/t-AML, 79 (20%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 5, 95 (25%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 7, and 85 (22%) patients had abnormalities of both chromosomes 5 and 7. t-MDS/t-AML with a -5/del(5q) is associated with a complex karyotype, characterized by trisomy 8, as well as loss of 12p, 13q, 16q22, 17p (TP53 locus), chromosome 18, and 20q. In addition, this subtype of t-AML is characterized by a unique expression profile (higher expression of genes) involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), loss of expression of IRF8, and overexpression of FHL2. Haploinsufficiency of the RPS14, EGR1, APC, NPM1, and CTNNA1 genes on 5q has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML. In previous studies, we determined that Egr1 acts by haploinsufficiency and cooperates with mutations induced by alkylating agents to induce myeloid leukemias in the mouse. To identify mutations that cooperate with Egr1 haploinsufficiency, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis. To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci). Of note is that the EVI1 transcription factor gene is deregulated in human AMLs, particularly those with -7, and abnormalities of 3q.

Azacitidine prolongs overall survival compared with conventional care regimens in elderly patients with low bone marrow blast count acute myeloid leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-12-21,"In a phase III randomized trial, azacitidine significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with conventional care regimens (CCRs) in patients with intermediate-2- and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Approximately one third of these patients were classified as having acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under current WHO criteria. This analysis compared the effects of azacitidine versus CCR on OS in this subgroup. Patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m(2)/d or CCR (best supportive care [BSC] only, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), or intensive chemotherapy [IC]). Of the 113 elderly patients (median age, 70 years) randomly assigned to receive azacitidine (n = 55) or CCR (n = 58; 47% BSC, 34% LDAC, 19% IC), 86% were considered unfit for IC. At a median follow-up of 20.1 months, median OS for azacitidine-treated patients was 24.5 months compared with 16.0 months for CCR-treated patients (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.79; P = .005), and 2-year OS rates were 50% and 16%, respectively (P = .001). Two-year OS rates were higher with azacitidine versus CCR in patients considered unfit for IC (P = .0003). Azacitidine was associated with fewer total days in hospital (P < .0001) than CCR. In older adult patients with low marrow blast count (20% to 30%) WHO-defined AML, azacitidine significantly prolongs OS and significantly improves several patient morbidity measures compared with CCR.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",3683.0,640.0,phase III randomized trial azacitidine significantly prolonged overall survival OS compared conventional care regimens CCRs patients intermediate-2- high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes Approximately patients classified acute myeloid leukemia AML current criteria compared effects azacitidine versus CCR OS subgroup Patients randomly assigned receive subcutaneous azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 /d CCR best supportive care BSC low-dose cytarabine LDAC intensive chemotherapy IC 113 elderly patients median age 70 years randomly assigned receive azacitidine n 55 CCR n 58 47 BSC 34 LDAC 19 IC 86 considered unfit IC median follow-up 20.1 months median OS azacitidine-treated patients 24.5 months compared 16.0 months CCR-treated patients hazard ratio 0.47 95 CI 0.28 0.79 P .005 2-year OS rates 50 16 respectively P .001 Two-year OS rates higher azacitidine versus CCR patients considered unfit IC P .0003 Azacitidine associated fewer total days hospital P .0001 CCR older adult patients low marrow blast count 20 30 WHO-defined AML azacitidine significantly prolongs OS significantly improves patient morbidity measures compared CCR,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 8, 124, 316, 384, 160, 3752, 97, 1069, 63, 25, 118, 72, 5, 809, 165, 472, 24579, 4, 7, 5, 919, 18, 2, 64, 43, 2040, 705, 104, 1282, 1, 46, 7, 11, 1373, 22, 1041, 286, 533, 329, 669, 291, 54, 371, 26, 65, 72, 3, 176, 1, 3752, 185, 4992, 23, 118, 4, 26, 1363, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 2529, 3752, 481, 81, 188, 18, 427, 15, 4992, 824, 1877, 165, 8472, 158, 154, 61, 1855, 10714, 15, 1686, 56, 2340, 1, 3, 4259, 1216, 7, 52, 89, 431, 60, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 3752, 78, 614, 15, 4992, 78, 717, 662, 8472, 562, 10714, 326, 2340, 868, 11, 515, 9681, 9, 2340, 28, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 179, 14, 53, 52, 118, 9, 3752, 73, 7, 10, 259, 33, 53, 72, 5, 245, 13, 53, 9, 4992, 73, 7, 360, 197, 13, 662, 48, 58, 13, 339, 6, 13, 842, 19, 1614, 2, 18, 111, 118, 151, 11, 212, 2, 245, 106, 19, 144, 100, 111, 118, 151, 11, 142, 5, 3752, 185, 4992, 4, 7, 515, 9681, 9, 2340, 19, 4418, 3752, 10, 41, 5, 1497, 181, 162, 4, 702, 19, 488, 76, 4992, 4, 434, 780, 7, 5, 154, 581, 3112, 1276, 179, 6, 201, 54, 395, 329, 3752, 97, 5613, 118, 2, 97, 1804, 392, 69, 787, 1018, 72, 5, 4992]",1339.0,20026804,Azacitidine prolongs overall survival compared conventional care regimens elderly patients low bone marrow blast count acute myeloid leukemia,8,0.013961605584642234

A myeloablative regimen was used for conditioning in 77%. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse were 41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38-44) and 27% (24-30) at 1 year and 48% (44-51) and 31% (28-34) at 5 years, respectively.

Acute erythroid leukemia: a reassessment using criteria refined in the 2008 WHO classification.,Blood,Blood,2009-12-29,"Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a rare type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for which diagnostic criteria have been refined in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of AML. The relationship of AEL to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and to AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) is not clearly defined. We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of patients with AEL and compared them with patients with MDS or AML-MRC with erythroid hyperplasia (> or = 50% erythroid cells). Among a total of 124 patients with AEL, 32% had a history of MDS or chronic cytopenia, 32% had therapy-related disease, and 35% had de novo disease. Sixty-four percent of patients had unfavorable AML risk-group karyotypes. FLT3 and RAS mutations were infrequent, occurring in 6% and 2%, respectively.

Thalidomide and lenalidomide as new therapeutics for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2010-01-01,"The use of nucleoside analog-based chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens over the last decade has significantly improved outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nonetheless, virtually all patients with CLL relapse from chemoimmmunotherapy and current available therapies are not curative. Identifying therapies that effectively eliminate CLL cells and lack immunesuppression represent an exciting new therapeutic approach. IMiDs are a class of immunomodulating drugs that increase T-cell and NK-cell directed killing of tumor cells. The first generation molecule is thalidomide followed by a second generation molecule lenalidomide that lacks neurotoxicity and is being explored more extensively in clinical trials. Lenalidomide has been shown to benefit patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphoma. Initial reports in patients with relapsed and refractory CLL have shown promising responses. In a subset of patients with CLL complete responses have been noted. Subsequent studies, however, have suggested that this class of drug can also have serious and potentially life-threatening side effects including myelosuppression, tumor flare reaction and in a small subset of patients tumor lysis syndrome. Tumor flare with both thalidomide and lenalidomide appear to be disease specific to CLL and may reflect clinical manifestation of CLL tumor cell activation. As a consequence of these disease specific effects, the optimal safe dose of lenalidomide in CLL remains to be determined but appears to be lower than that tolerated in other B-cell malignancies. To date, biomarkers for response remain poorly defined and the relationship of clinical benefit to tumor flare is uncertain. This review examines the existing literature on the use of IMiDs in patients with CLL and provides suggestions for future research in this area.",Journal Article,3672.0,26.0,use nucleoside analog-based chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens decade significantly improved outcomes patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL Nonetheless virtually patients CLL relapse chemoimmmunotherapy current available therapies curative Identifying therapies effectively eliminate CLL lack immunesuppression represent exciting new therapeutic approach IMiDs class immunomodulating drugs increase T-cell NK-cell directed killing generation molecule thalidomide followed second generation molecule lenalidomide lacks neurotoxicity explored extensively clinical trials Lenalidomide shown benefit patients multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndromes lymphoma Initial reports patients relapsed refractory CLL shown promising responses subset patients CLL complete responses noted Subsequent studies suggested class drug potentially life-threatening effects including myelosuppression flare reaction small subset patients lysis syndrome flare thalidomide lenalidomide appear disease specific CLL reflect clinical manifestation CLL activation consequence disease specific effects optimal safe dose lenalidomide CLL remains determined appears lower tolerated B-cell malignancies date biomarkers response remain poorly defined relationship clinical benefit flare uncertain review examines existing literature use IMiDs patients CLL provides suggestions future research area,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 119, 1, 4032, 3497, 90, 3341, 3222, 472, 252, 3, 1060, 2025, 71, 97, 231, 123, 4, 7, 5, 442, 1193, 552, 4648, 5860, 62, 7, 5, 552, 429, 29, 58535, 2, 291, 390, 235, 32, 44, 1075, 1386, 235, 17, 1856, 4964, 552, 37, 2, 926, 58536, 1231, 35, 4963, 217, 189, 353, 7587, 32, 8, 1040, 1, 13861, 600, 17, 344, 102, 31, 2, 1765, 31, 1166, 3003, 1, 30, 37, 3, 157, 914, 1354, 16, 2159, 370, 20, 8, 419, 914, 1354, 1288, 17, 6856, 3561, 2, 16, 486, 1443, 80, 3576, 4, 38, 143, 1288, 71, 85, 443, 6, 247, 7, 5, 232, 2040, 2, 388, 1198, 4, 7, 5, 591, 2, 430, 552, 47, 443, 721, 253, 4, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 552, 236, 253, 47, 85, 1051, 706, 94, 137, 47, 1148, 17, 26, 1040, 1, 234, 122, 120, 47, 1762, 2, 751, 358, 3691, 1152, 176, 141, 2858, 30, 6915, 1329, 2, 4, 8, 302, 697, 1, 7, 30, 4783, 681, 30, 6915, 5, 110, 2159, 2, 1288, 1322, 6, 40, 34, 112, 6, 552, 2, 68, 2694, 38, 6746, 1, 552, 30, 31, 363, 22, 8, 4177, 1, 46, 34, 112, 176, 3, 665, 1165, 61, 1, 1288, 4, 552, 469, 6, 40, 509, 84, 1233, 6, 40, 280, 76, 17, 421, 4, 127, 132, 31, 441, 6, 1244, 582, 9, 51, 918, 1240, 395, 2, 3, 858, 1, 38, 247, 6, 30, 6915, 16, 2717, 26, 206, 4468, 3, 1692, 789, 23, 3, 119, 1, 7587, 4, 7, 5, 552, 2, 777, 9796, 9, 508, 389, 4, 26, 965]",1805.0,20055657,Thalidomide lenalidomide new therapeutics treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia,49,0.08551483420593368

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-01-13,"Reduced-intensity-conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is markedly underutilized in the elderly, in part because the impact of advanced age on outcomes is poorly understood. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes in 158 consecutive hematologic malignancy patients aged > or =60 years (median, 63 years; range: 60-71 years) undergoing fludarabine/busulfan-based RIC, with a median-follow-up of 34 months (range: 12.0-85.7). Multivariate analysis was undertaken for factors having an impact on outcome. For the patients aged > or =60 years, 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse was 10% and 54.6%, respectively. Two-year overall and progression-free survival (OS, PFS) was 46% and 35%, respectively.

In this study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assay was developed to quantify expression of hCLP46 in the peripheral blood of AML and T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) primary samples and in six leukemic cell lines. Also, we investigated expression of CDKN2A/B and the apoptosis in U937 cells when hCLP46 is downregulated in vitro. Our findings showed that hCLP46 was overexpressed in AML, T-ALL, and the leukemic cell lines. Suppressing hCLP46 overexpression had no effect on expression of CDKN2A/B and apoptosis of U937 cells.

Characteristics of pericardial effusions in patients with leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-05-01,"Little information exists regarding the prevalence and natural history of pericardial disease in patients with leukemia. Recently, it has been reported that the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors is associated with an increased incidence of pericardial effusions (PEs). To study the characteristics and treatment relationships of PEs in patients with leukemia, the authors retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients with leukemia evaluated at a single center. The authors reviewed 2592 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 1282, 49%), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n = 336, 13%), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, n = 974, 38%), who were evaluated from August 2003 to July 2008. Electronic medical records were reviewed to select patients who had undergone at least 1 echocardiographic evaluation. Data regarding diagnosis, timing, effusion size, survival, and prior therapy were collected for the patients who had echocardiographic evidence of PEs. PEs were detected in 325 (20%) of the patients who had echocardiograms: 21% in AML, 23% in ALL, and 18% in MDS patients. Only a small portion of PEs were detected before the initiation of therapy: 26% in AML, 25% ALL, and 15% in MDS patients. Most PEs were of minimal size (70%) overall.

Effect of age on outcome of reduced-intensity hematopoietic cell transplantation for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission or with myelodysplastic syndrome.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-03-08,"PURPOSE Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) primarily afflict older individuals. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is generally not offered because of concerns of excess morbidity and mortality. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allow increased use of allogeneic HCT for older patients. To define prognostic factors impacting long-term outcomes of RIC regimens in patients older than age 40 years with AML in first complete remission or MDS and to determine the impact of age, we analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed data reported to the CIBMTR (1995 to 2005) on 1,080 patients undergoing RIC HCT. Outcomes analyzed included neutrophil recovery, incidence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Univariate analyses demonstrated no age group differences in NRM, grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, or relapse. Patients age 40 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and > or = 65 years had 2-year survival rates as follows: 44% (95% CI, 37% to 52%), 50% (95% CI, 41% to 59%), 34% (95% CI, 25% to 43%), and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 49%), respectively, for patients with AML (P = .06); and 42% (95% CI, 35% to 49%), 35% (95% CI, 27% to 43%), 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%), and 38% (95% CI, 25% to 51%), respectively, for patients with MDS (P = .37). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant impact of age on NRM, relapse, DFS, or OS (all P > .3). Greater HLA disparity adversely affected 2-year NRM, DFS, and OS. Unfavorable cytogenetics adversely impacted relapse, DFS, and OS. Better pre-HCT performance status predicted improved 2-year OS.

These agents may complement each other by targeting both the bone marrow microenvironment and hypomethylating action on the malignant clone. This phase I trial explored the safety of combination therapy in patients with higher-risk MDS. Response and characterization of molecular and methylation status of responders were secondary objectives. Patients were enrolled using a 3 + 3 dose escalation. Cycles lasted 28 days, and patients received a maximum of seven cycles. Of 18 patients enrolled, median age was 68 years (range, 52 to 78 years), interval from diagnosis was 5 weeks (range, 2 to 106 weeks), and follow-up was 7 months (range, 1 to 26 months). International Prognostic Scoring System categories were intermediate 1 (n = 2), intermediate 2 (n = 10), and high (n = 6). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred, and a maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. Grades 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicities (> 1) included febrile neutropenia (n = 5), cardiac (n = 2), and CNS hemorrhage (n = 2). Median absolute neutrophil count decrease was 26%, and platelet decrease was 1% (mean, 24%). The overall response rate was 67%: eight patients (44%) had a complete response (CR); three patients (17%) had hematologic improvement; one patient (6%) had marrow CR. Patients achieving CR were more likely to have normal cytogenetics and lower methylation levels. The combination of lenalidomide and azacitidine is well tolerated with encouraging clinical activity.

"DNA methylation detection using MS-qFRET, a quantum dot-based nanoassay.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",Methods,2010-04-01,"Detection of aberrant promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes can be used as a prognostic or predictive marker for carcinogenesis. Since epigenetic modifying agents are FDA approved for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, laboratory correlative tools to monitor response to this targeted therapy are important. Methylation specific quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (MS-qFRET) is a nanotechnology assay that enables the detection of methylation and its changes in a sensitive, quantifiable manner. It utilizes quantum dot-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer to achieve highly sensitive detection of DNA methylation. Template DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite such that unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil while methylated cytosines remain unconverted. Thereafter, the converted template is amplified using biotinylated methylation-specific primers. Quantum dots, functionalized with streptavidin, serve both as a scaffold to capture amplicons and as a donor for transferring energy to the Cy5 acceptor that is incorporated into the amplicons during PCR. Thus, the status of DNA methylation can be determined according to the level of FRET. In this report, MS-qFRET is validated in cell lines and then used to detect the status of p15(INK4B) methylation in clinical samples from eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",Journal Article,3582.0,31.0,Detection aberrant promoter hypermethylation suppressor prognostic predictive marker carcinogenesis epigenetic modifying agents FDA approved treatment patients myelodysplastic syndrome laboratory correlative tools monitor response targeted therapy important Methylation specific quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer MS-qFRET nanotechnology enables detection methylation changes sensitive quantifiable manner utilizes quantum dot-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer achieve highly sensitive detection DNA methylation Template DNA treated sodium bisulfite unmethylated cytosines converted uracil methylated cytosines remain unconverted converted template amplified biotinylated methylation-specific primers Quantum dots functionalized streptavidin serve scaffold capture amplicons donor transferring energy Cy5 acceptor incorporated amplicons PCR status DNA methylation determined according level FRET report MS-qFRET validated lines detect status p15 INK4B methylation clinical patients acute myeloid leukemia,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[638, 1, 1898, 973, 2575, 1, 30, 1245, 214, 122, 40, 95, 22, 8, 177, 15, 464, 952, 9, 1719, 1192, 1418, 4898, 183, 32, 2078, 850, 9, 24, 1, 7, 5, 681, 1624, 3679, 1896, 6, 3334, 51, 6, 26, 238, 36, 32, 305, 569, 112, 14251, 13129, 1591, 1535, 2803, 2602, 2307, 45961, 16, 8, 8882, 719, 17, 4843, 3, 638, 1, 569, 2, 211, 400, 4, 8, 745, 11639, 1708, 192, 9639, 14251, 13129, 517, 1591, 1535, 2803, 2602, 6, 1359, 561, 745, 638, 1, 261, 569, 5932, 261, 16, 157, 73, 5, 4682, 6181, 225, 17, 8100, 23365, 32, 4764, 6, 11813, 369, 2963, 23365, 918, 58819, 3972, 3, 4764, 5932, 16, 2429, 75, 18353, 569, 112, 10031, 14251, 20435, 12962, 5, 17261, 1833, 110, 22, 8, 11547, 6, 2891, 15479, 2, 22, 8, 1488, 9, 18500, 2803, 6, 3, 8694, 19680, 17, 16, 2449, 237, 3, 15479, 190, 604, 631, 3, 156, 1, 261, 569, 122, 40, 509, 768, 6, 3, 301, 1, 39284, 4, 26, 414, 2307, 45961, 16, 938, 4, 31, 285, 2, 818, 95, 6, 1426, 3, 156, 1, 8840, 13536, 569, 4, 38, 347, 29, 659, 7, 5, 286, 533]",1355.0,20362674,DNA methylation detection MS-qFRET quantum dot-based nanoassay,0,0.0
Arsenic trioxide as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2006-03-01,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous bone marrow disorder primarily affecting older adults, for whom the only curative therapy, bone marrow transplantation, is rarely an option. New therapies, or novel applications of historical therapies, are desperately needed.

Arsenic trioxide - An old drug rediscovered.,Blood reviews,Blood Rev.,2010-05-15,"Over the last 17 years, clinical trials conducted worldwide have demonstrated the efficacy of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) in the treatment of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Currently, the role of As(2)O(3) in front-line therapy is under investigation. Recent trials in the US have demonstrated that the addition of As(2)O(3) to standard treatment regimens improves survival outcomes in patients with APL and may allow a reduction in cytotoxic chemotherapy exposure. As(2)O(3) has also shown efficacy in other malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Therapeutic doses of As(2)O(3) are well tolerated, with no evidence of long-term toxicity. Adverse events include APL differentiation syndrome, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and mild elevations in liver enzymes. This review highlights trials investigating the role of As(2)O(3) in induction and consolidation for newly diagnosed APL, as well as its role in other hematologic malignancies.

Acute erythroid leukemia as defined in the World Health Organization classification is a rare and pathogenetically heterogeneous disease.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-05-14,"The diagnostic criteria for acute erythroid leukemia have been controversial since this disease was initially described. Using the current World Health Organization classification criteria, we retrospectively reviewed cases of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in which erythroid precursors were >or=50% of the bone marrow nucleated cell population and the diagnosis of erythroleukemia was considered using older classification schemes. We collected 90 cases and separated them into four diagnostic groups: acute erythroid leukemia, erythroleukemia or erythroid/myeloid type (n=20); acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (n=22); therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (n=32); and refractory anemia with excess blasts and preceding or concurrent history of erythropoietin therapy for anemia (n=16). Patients with acute erythroid leukemia were the youngest patient group and had the best overall survival. There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients with acute erythroid leukemia versus acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (P=0.003) and between patients with acute erythroid leukemia versus therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (P<0.0001). The presence of complex cytogenetic abnormalities (>3) was the only statistically significant independent variable that adversely affected survival in the acute erythroid leukemia group. Monosomy 5/del(5q) and monosomy 7/del(7q) were overrepresented in the context of complex chromosomal abnormalities. Our data suggest that acute erythroid leukemia, as currently defined in the World Health Organization classification, has become a rare disease. A majority of the cases reported previously as erythroleukemia are now classified as other entities. In addition, our data suggest that the current definition of acute erythroid leukemia, erythroleukemia type remains heterogeneous. One subset of acute erythroid leukemia patients has relatively low blast counts and are diploid. The prognosis of this patient subset is relatively good. The other subset has cytogenetic abnormalities similar to those in myelodysplastic syndromes and a poor prognosis.",Journal Article,3539.0,26.0,diagnostic criteria acute erythroid leukemia controversial disease initially described current World Health Organization classification criteria retrospectively reviewed cases acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome erythroid precursors or=50 bone marrow nucleated population diagnosis erythroleukemia considered older classification schemes collected 90 cases separated diagnostic groups acute erythroid leukemia erythroleukemia erythroid/myeloid type n=20 acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplasia-related changes n=22 therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia n=32 refractory anemia excess blasts preceding concurrent history erythropoietin therapy anemia n=16 Patients acute erythroid leukemia youngest patient group best overall survival statistically significant difference overall survival patients acute erythroid leukemia versus acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplasia-related changes P=0.003 patients acute erythroid leukemia versus therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia P 0.0001 presence complex cytogenetic abnormalities 3 statistically significant independent variable adversely affected survival acute erythroid leukemia group Monosomy 5/del 5q monosomy 7/del 7q overrepresented context complex chromosomal abnormalities suggest acute erythroid leukemia currently defined World Health Organization classification rare disease majority cases reported previously erythroleukemia classified entities addition suggest current definition acute erythroid leukemia erythroleukemia type remains heterogeneous subset acute erythroid leukemia patients relatively low blast counts diploid prognosis patient subset relatively good subset cytogenetic abnormalities similar myelodysplastic syndromes poor prognosis,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 752, 371, 9, 286, 7839, 47, 85, 2010, 1192, 26, 34, 10, 1625, 1027, 75, 3, 291, 1956, 341, 2533, 947, 371, 21, 894, 446, 140, 1, 286, 533, 15, 681, 4, 92, 7839, 4881, 11, 15, 212, 1, 3, 581, 9862, 31, 266, 2, 3, 147, 1, 14661, 10, 515, 75, 434, 947, 7103, 21, 786, 424, 140, 2, 4910, 1370, 237, 294, 752, 271, 286, 7839, 14661, 15, 7839, 533, 267, 78, 179, 286, 533, 5, 6128, 139, 400, 78, 350, 36, 139, 286, 533, 78, 531, 2, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 2, 5892, 15, 750, 532, 1, 6266, 36, 9, 1545, 78, 245, 7, 5, 286, 7839, 11, 3, 13042, 69, 87, 2, 42, 3, 824, 63, 25, 125, 10, 8, 712, 93, 523, 4, 63, 25, 59, 7, 5, 286, 7839, 185, 286, 533, 5, 6128, 139, 400, 19, 13, 1421, 2, 59, 7, 5, 286, 7839, 185, 36, 139, 286, 533, 19, 13, 488, 3, 463, 1, 840, 1266, 1171, 27, 10, 3, 158, 712, 93, 306, 1347, 17, 4311, 1424, 25, 4, 3, 286, 7839, 87, 7521, 33, 3084, 5460, 2, 7521, 67, 3084, 9723, 11, 13094, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 840, 1860, 1171, 114, 74, 309, 17, 286, 7839, 22, 694, 395, 4, 3, 1956, 341, 2533, 947, 71, 1417, 8, 622, 34, 8, 686, 1, 3, 140, 210, 373, 22, 14661, 32, 1134, 1373, 22, 127, 4613, 4, 352, 114, 74, 309, 17, 3, 291, 2470, 1, 286, 7839, 14661, 267, 469, 1564, 104, 697, 1, 286, 7839, 7, 71, 1352, 154, 3112, 1911, 2, 32, 6815, 3, 356, 1, 26, 69, 697, 16, 1352, 1178, 3, 127, 697, 71, 1266, 1171, 288, 6, 135, 4, 2040, 2, 8, 334, 356]",1986.0,20473273,Acute erythroid leukemia defined World Health Organization classification rare pathogenetically heterogeneous disease,0,0.0

The median number of administered cycles was 3. Most patients (39; 95%) received a standard dose of the drugs at the initiation of therapy. Nine patients (22%) required treatment interruptions or discontinuation, and 10 patients (24%) required dose reductions. The overall response rate was 63%, and 4 patients (10%) achieved a complete response. Twenty patients (51%) experienced grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression-related toxicities. Hospitalization was required in 68% of the patients. Among 12 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL per minute or less, 6 required dose reductions attributable to myelosuppression (n = 3) or to worsening renal function (n = 3). The overall survival (OS) at 18 months was 12%, and the median OS was 8.6 months. The use of HA in patients with RI is feasible, but is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity.

Predictors and outcome of acute kidney injury in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-09-01,": Acute kidney injury (AKIis a common complication in the treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS), but, to the authors' knowledge, its clinical relevance has not been detailed to date. The objective of the current study was to identify the incidence, predictors, and outcome for AKI in patients with AML and HR-MDS. : Data were analyzed from 537 patients with AML or HR-MDS undergoing induction chemotherapy from 1999 to 2007. Predictors for AKI were identified by logistic regression. Eight-week mortality of patients was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by the RIFLE criteria, a novel multilevel classification system for AKI based on the percent rise in serum creatinine from baseline (Risk, >50%; Injury, >100%; and Failure, >200% or requiring dialysis). : A total of 187 patients (36%) developed AKI. Significant independent risk factors for AKI included the following: age >/=55 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.8), mechanical ventilation (OR, 16), use of vancomycin (OR, 2.3), diuretics (OR, 3.0), amphotericin B lipid formulation (OR, 2.7), vasopressors (OR, 4.9), leukopenia (OR, 1.9), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 1.4), and use of non-fludarabine-based chemotherapy (OR, 2.7). The 8-week mortality rates were 3.8%, 13.6%, 19.6%, and 61.7% for the non-RIFLE, Risk, Injury, and Failure categories, respectively. Patients requiring dialysis (8%) had a median survival of 33 days. Survival of patients who achieved complete remission was favorable, regardless of degree of AKI. : The RIFLE classification for AKI appears to have prognostic utility in predicting mortality in patients with AML or HR-MDS. Relatively mild elevations in creatinine are associated with higher mortality. Strategies to avoid nephrotoxic drugs or fluid overload may be of benefit. Cancer 2010.

The molecular pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes.,Cancer biology & therapy,Cancer Biol. Ther.,2010-08-05,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are frequently associated with clonally restricted cytogenetic abnormalities, but until recently, the molecular pathobiology underlying this diverse group of neoplastic bone marrow disorders has been largely obscure. During the last 10 years, many investigative groups have applied the formidable power of new molecular biology techniques to hunt for recurrent genetic alterations in MDS primary cells. Several genetic abnormalities, including mutations in RUNX1 (AML1), TET2, ASXL1 and TP53, have been discovered in a substantial fraction of MDS cases; genes rearranged or mutated less commonly in MDS include IER3, ATRX, RAS and FLT3. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency and expression changes in RPS14, miR-145 and miR-146a, CDC25c, PP2A and SPARC in the absence of point mutations have also been implicated in MDS pathobiology. A major challenge will be to determine which of these mutations are causative ""drivers"" either in the development or progression of MDS, which might be therapeutically important because they predict response to treatment, and which are merely ""passengers"" along for the ride that alter phenotype but have no effect on the natural history of the disease. While the altered cellular biology of MDS is also increasingly well-understood, many mysteries remain. Abnormalities in iron regulation, microenvironment interactions, regulation of apoptosis and oxidative damage/DNA repair may all play an important pathobiological role. By gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of these complex and heterogeneous diseases, we will hopefully improve our ability to treat our patients with MDS beyond the therapies with limited effectiveness that are available at present.",Journal Article,3456.0,35.0,myelodysplastic syndromes MDS frequently associated clonally restricted cytogenetic abnormalities recently molecular pathobiology underlying diverse group neoplastic bone marrow disorders largely obscure 10 years investigative groups applied formidable power new molecular techniques hunt recurrent genetic alterations MDS primary genetic abnormalities including RUNX1 AML1 TET2 ASXL1 TP53 discovered substantial fraction MDS cases rearranged commonly MDS include IER3 ATRX RAS FLT3 Furthermore haploinsufficiency expression changes RPS14 miR-145 miR-146a CDC25c PP2A SPARC absence point implicated MDS pathobiology major challenge determine causative `` drivers '' development progression MDS therapeutically important predict response treatment merely `` passengers '' ride alter phenotype effect natural history disease altered cellular MDS increasingly well-understood mysteries remain Abnormalities iron regulation microenvironment interactions regulation apoptosis oxidative damage/DNA repair play important pathobiological role gaining deeper understanding mechanisms complex heterogeneous diseases hopefully improve ability treat patients MDS therapies limited effectiveness available present,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2040, 1223, 32, 746, 41, 5, 9157, 2016, 1266, 1171, 84, 1100, 761, 3, 219, 8465, 1181, 26, 1867, 87, 1, 2000, 581, 1997, 71, 85, 1733, 12323, 190, 3, 1060, 79, 60, 445, 15504, 271, 47, 1498, 3, 11940, 2349, 1, 217, 219, 891, 1092, 6, 46101, 9, 387, 336, 593, 4, 1223, 86, 37, 392, 336, 1171, 141, 138, 4, 6092, 6535, 5038, 7782, 2, 1206, 47, 85, 2747, 4, 8, 1281, 1509, 1, 1223, 140, 214, 3201, 15, 1185, 299, 841, 4, 1223, 643, 59124, 7955, 1102, 2, 1224, 798, 9292, 2, 55, 400, 4, 45786, 722, 4058, 2, 722, 39365, 20292, 7890, 2, 9400, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 741, 138, 47, 120, 85, 1771, 4, 1223, 8465, 8, 458, 1745, 303, 40, 6, 223, 92, 1, 46, 138, 32, 8088, 3391, 522, 361, 4, 3, 193, 15, 91, 1, 1223, 92, 822, 40, 4602, 305, 408, 491, 678, 51, 6, 24, 2, 92, 32, 17187, 28971, 522, 1510, 9, 3, 37586, 17, 2688, 1005, 84, 47, 77, 254, 23, 3, 1504, 532, 1, 3, 34, 369, 3, 1495, 763, 891, 1, 1223, 16, 120, 1635, 149, 1784, 445, 26458, 918, 1171, 4, 4231, 863, 995, 1286, 863, 1, 351, 2, 3495, 1350, 261, 972, 68, 62, 1343, 35, 305, 22217, 200, 20, 7312, 8, 6029, 612, 1, 3, 483, 1, 46, 840, 2, 1564, 1342, 21, 303, 7464, 401, 114, 801, 6, 943, 114, 7, 5, 1223, 1654, 3, 235, 5, 383, 1236, 17, 32, 390, 28, 364]",1689.0,20592488,molecular pathogenesis myelodysplastic syndromes,13,0.02268760907504363
Non-small cell lung cancer resection in lymphoma patients.,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Ann. Thorac. Surg.,2010-07-01,"Lymphoma patients are at an increased risk of developing secondary malignancies, including lung cancer. It is unknown if these patients are at higher risk of dying from pulmonary resection due to lymphoma or if they have reasonable long-term survival. We identified 47 lymphoma patients, seven of which had active lymphoma and forty with a history of lymphoma, who underwent resection for lung cancer between 1998 and 2008. We matched lymphoma patients with lung cancer patients who had no lymphoma based on age, gender, surgery type, comorbidities, stage, and histology. We analyzed differences in the length of hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and overall and lung cancer specific survival between the lymphoma group and the matched no lymphoma group. We found no significant difference in length of hospitalization, morbidity, or mortality between the lymphoma and matched no lymphoma group. The lymphoma group's 5-year overall survival rate (35%) was significantly lower than that of the no lymphoma group (67%; p = 0.04). However, the difference in lung cancer-specific survival between the groups was not significant. The cause-of-death analysis revealed that lymphoma patients also died from recurrent lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myeloid leukemia.

On a phase II study, 80 patients with low-grade, transformed, or mantle cell lymphoma received ABMT with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) purging as part of initial or salvage therapy. Diagnoses included nontransformed follicular lymphoma in 63% and transformed lymphoma in 15%. With 16.6-year median follow-up for survival, actuarial 10-year EFS and overall survival (OS) were 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-46%) and 45% (35%-57%). Median EFS and OS were 3.0 and 8.0 years. Early nonrelapse mortality incidence was 8%; myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia incidence was 4%. Most relapses occurred within 3 years, with a median time to diagnosis of relapse of 1.8 years (range: 0.1-15.6 years). On multivariate analysis, age >50 years, ≥3 prior chemotherapy regimens, and ABMT after relapse were associated with significantly inferior survival. Fifteen patients (19%) were event-free >15 years after transplantation, raising the possibility of a plateau in the progression-free survival curve.

Severe hypoalbuminemia at day 90 predicts worse nonrelapse mortality and overall survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-07-22,"Because patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remain in the vicinity of the transplant center for approximately 90 days posttransplantation, identifying prognostic factors to determine those at immediate higher risk of mortality is essential. A normal serum albumin level generally denotes healthiness. We evaluated the prognostic significance of day 90 hypoalbuminemia (and other clinical, pharmacologic, and laboratory variables) in 163 patients, median age 48 years (range, 19-69 years), who underwent allo-HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 124) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 39). Day 90 hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL) was associated with worse nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and poor overall survival (OS). The estimated 1- and 2-year cumulative incidence rates of NRM were 48% and 52%, respectively, and the corresponding OS rates were 7% and 3%. Serum albumin level <3.0 g/dL and Karnofsky score <80 at day 90 were strong independent predictors of worse NRM and OS in multivariate analysis.

Maintenance therapy with low-dose azacitidine after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: a dose and schedule finding study.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-07-29,"Recurrence is a major cause of treatment failure after allogeneic transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and treatment options are very limited. Azacitidine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with activity in myeloid disease. The authors hypothesized that low-dose azacitidine administered after transplant would reduce recurrence rates, and conducted a study to determine a safe dose/schedule combination. Forty-five high-risk patients were treated. Median age was 60 years; median number of comorbidities was 3; 67% were not in remission. By using a Bayesian adaptive method to determine the best dose/schedule combination based on time to toxicity, the authors investigated combinations of 5 daily azacitidine doses, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 mg/m2, and 4 schedules: 1, 2, 3, or 4 cycles, each with 5 days of drug and 25 days of rest. Cycle 1 started on Day +40. Reversible thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity. The optimal combination was 32 mg/m2 given for 4 cycles. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. One-year event-free and overall survival were 58% and 77%, justifying further studies to estimate long-term clinical benefit. No dose significantly affected DNA global methylation. Azacitidine at 32 mg/m2 given for 5 days is safe and can be administered after allogeneic transplant for at least 4 cycles to heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients. The trial also suggested that this treatment may prolong event-free and overall survival, and that more cycles may be associated with greater benefit.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3463.0,281.0,Recurrence major cause treatment failure allogeneic transplantation acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS treatment options limited Azacitidine DNA methyltransferase inhibitor activity myeloid disease authors hypothesized low-dose azacitidine administered transplant reduce recurrence rates conducted determine safe dose/schedule combination Forty-five high-risk patients treated Median age 60 years median number comorbidities 3 67 remission Bayesian adaptive determine best dose/schedule combination based time toxicity authors investigated combinations 5 daily azacitidine doses 8 16 24 32 40 mg/m2 4 schedules 1 2 3 4 cycles 5 days drug 25 days rest Cycle 1 started Day +40 Reversible thrombocytopenia dose-limiting toxicity optimal combination 32 mg/m2 given 4 cycles Median follow-up 20.5 months One-year event-free overall survival 58 77 justifying studies estimate long-term clinical benefit dose significantly affected DNA global methylation Azacitidine 32 mg/m2 given 5 days safe administered allogeneic transplant 4 cycles heavily pretreated AML/MDS patients trial suggested treatment prolong event-free overall survival cycles associated greater benefit,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[146, 16, 8, 458, 708, 1, 24, 496, 50, 1063, 497, 9, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 2, 24, 838, 32, 923, 383, 3752, 16, 8, 261, 3747, 230, 5, 128, 4, 533, 34, 3, 738, 1237, 17, 154, 61, 3752, 468, 50, 941, 688, 969, 146, 151, 2, 426, 8, 45, 6, 223, 8, 1165, 61, 1055, 150, 1213, 365, 64, 43, 7, 11, 73, 52, 89, 10, 335, 60, 52, 207, 1, 1909, 10, 27, 598, 11, 44, 4, 734, 20, 75, 8, 5032, 2454, 596, 6, 223, 3, 824, 61, 1055, 150, 90, 23, 98, 6, 155, 3, 738, 565, 1247, 1, 33, 391, 3752, 415, 66, 245, 259, 531, 2, 327, 81, 821, 2, 39, 2314, 14, 18, 27, 15, 39, 410, 296, 5, 33, 162, 1, 234, 2, 243, 162, 1, 3677, 417, 14, 3461, 23, 218, 327, 2786, 1340, 10, 3, 61, 817, 155, 3, 665, 150, 10, 531, 81, 821, 447, 9, 39, 410, 52, 166, 126, 10, 179, 33, 53, 104, 111, 774, 115, 2, 63, 25, 11, 717, 2, 849, 13579, 195, 94, 6, 1191, 319, 337, 38, 247, 77, 61, 97, 1424, 261, 1648, 569, 3752, 28, 531, 81, 821, 447, 9, 33, 162, 16, 1165, 2, 122, 40, 468, 50, 1063, 941, 9, 28, 506, 39, 410, 6, 2447, 2193, 329, 1223, 7, 3, 160, 120, 1148, 17, 26, 24, 68, 3615, 774, 115, 2, 63, 25, 2, 17, 80, 410, 68, 40, 41, 5, 378, 247]",1495.0,20672358,Maintenance therapy low-dose azacitidine allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome dose schedule finding,61,0.10645724258289703
Chromatin remodeling is required for gene reactivation after decitabine-mediated DNA hypomethylation.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2010-08-16,"The DNA hypomethylating drug decitabine (DAC) reactivates silenced gene expression in cancer and is approved for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome. Gene reactivation after DAC is variable and incompletely understood. Here, we established a cell line system (YB5) derived from the SW48 colon cancer cell line to study DAC-induced reactivation. YB5 contains a hypermethylated cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the locus is transcriptionally silent. GFP reexpression can be achieved by DAC treatment, but the expression level of individual cells is heterogeneous. DAC-treated YB5 cells were separated into GFP-positive and GFP-negative subpopulations. By comparing DAC-treated sorted GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, we found that their methylation levels were similarly decreased but that histone modifications and histone H3 densities were remarkably different. Despite a similar degree of (incomplete) DNA hypomethylation, GFP-positive cells reverted to an active chromatin structure marked by higher H3K9 acetylation, lower H3K27 trimethylation, and lower promoter nucleosome density. GFP-negative cells had histone modifications and promoter nucleosome density, similar to parental cells. On DAC withdrawal, gradual resilencing and remethylation occurred in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells, and the resilencing correlated with a gradual increase in nucleosome occupancy in GFP-positive cells.

Overall survival was compared between patients receiving conventional-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin and either zosuquidar (550 mg; 212 patients) or placebo (221 patients). Median and 2-year overall survival values were 7.2 months and 20% on zosuquidar and 9.4 months and 23% on placebo, respectively (P = .281). Remission rate was 51.9% on zosuquidar and 48.9% on placebo. All cause mortality to day 42 was not different (zosuquidar 22.2% vs placebo 16.3%; P = .158). In vitro modulation of P-gp activity by zosuquidar and expression of P-gp, multidrug resistance-related protein 1, lung resistance protein, and breast cancer resistance protein, were comparable in the 2 arms. Poor-risk cytogenetics were more common in P-gp(+) patients. P-gp expression and cytogenetics were correlated, though independent prognostic factors.

Ninety-five patients with AML or MDS with either wild-type (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily. The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by ≥ 50% (BR). The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 wild-type. One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen. Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin. These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and wild-type. The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant AML.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3438.0,287.0,leading constitutive activation FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor FLT3 occur blasts 30 patients acute myeloid leukemia AML Midostaurin PKC412 N-benzoylstaurosporin multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor demonstrated activity patients AML/myelodysplastic syndrome MDS FLT3 Ninety-five patients AML MDS wild-type n 60 n 35 FLT3 randomly assigned receive oral midostaurin 50 100 mg twice daily drug discontinued absence response 2 months disease progression unacceptable toxicity Response defined complete response partial response PR hematologic improvement reduction peripheral blood bone marrow blasts ≥ 50 BR rate BR population efficacy assessed n 92 71 patients FLT3-mutant 42 patients FLT3 wild-type PR occurred patient FLT3-mutant receiving 100-mg dose regimen doses well-tolerated differences toxicity response rate according dose midostaurin suggest midostaurin hematologic activity patients FLT3-mutant wild-type degree clinical activity observed supports additional studies combine midostaurin agents chemotherapy especially FLT3-mutant AML,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[138, 1049, 6, 3178, 363, 1, 3, 5516, 733, 564, 216, 27, 153, 1224, 1271, 4, 2438, 1, 201, 1, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 8824, 7154, 78, 59272, 16, 8, 5947, 564, 216, 230, 5, 264, 128, 4, 7, 5, 329, 10589, 681, 1223, 5, 1224, 138, 2493, 365, 7, 5, 329, 15, 1223, 5, 361, 955, 267, 78, 335, 15, 1185, 78, 465, 1224, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 518, 8824, 28, 212, 15, 394, 81, 936, 391, 3, 234, 10, 2402, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 51, 28, 18, 53, 34, 91, 15, 3215, 155, 51, 10, 395, 22, 236, 51, 450, 51, 998, 813, 767, 15, 628, 4, 672, 315, 15, 581, 2438, 20, 749, 212, 5523, 3, 116, 1, 5523, 9, 3, 266, 4, 953, 209, 359, 40, 275, 78, 937, 10, 792, 4, 7, 5, 1224, 620, 2, 595, 4, 7, 5, 1224, 955, 267, 104, 998, 489, 4, 8, 69, 5, 1224, 620, 357, 3, 394, 81, 61, 477, 110, 415, 11, 149, 421, 125, 11, 77, 362, 4, 155, 15, 51, 116, 768, 6, 3, 61, 1, 8824, 46, 99, 309, 17, 8824, 71, 813, 128, 4, 110, 7, 5, 1224, 620, 2, 955, 267, 3, 1444, 1, 38, 128, 164, 2304, 402, 94, 17, 4680, 8824, 2, 127, 183, 225, 22, 56, 1093, 4, 1224, 620, 329]",1379.0,20733134,Phase IIB trial oral Midostaurin PKC412 FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor FLT3 multi-targeted kinase inhibitor patients acute myeloid leukemia high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome wild-type FLT3,0,0.0
Iron overload in patients with acute leukemia or MDS undergoing myeloablative stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-09-18,"Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) commonly have an elevated serum ferritin prior to HSCT, which has been associated with increased mortality after transplantation. This has led to the suggestion that iron overload is common and deleterious in this patient population. However, the relationship between serum ferritin and parenchymal iron overload in such patients is unknown. We report a prospective study of 48 patients with acute leukemia (AL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) undergoing myeloablative HSCT, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate liver iron content (LIC) and cardiac iron. The median (and range) pre-HSCT value of serum ferritin was 1549 ng/mL (20-6989); serum hepcidin, 59 ng/mL (10-468); labile plasma iron, 0 LPI units (0.0-0.9). Eighty-five percent of patients had hepatic iron overload (HIO), and 42% had significant HIO (LIC ≥5.0 mg/gdw). Only 1 patient had cardiac iron overload. There was a strong correlation between pre-HSCT serum ferritin and estimated LIC (r = .75), which was mostly dependent on prior transfusion history. Serum hepcidin was appropriately elevated in patients with HIO. Labile plasma iron elevation was rare. A regression calibration analysis supported the hypothesis that elevated pre-HSCT LIC is significantly associated with inferior post-HSCT survival.

Clofarabine ± fludarabine with once daily i.v. busulfan as pretransplant conditioning therapy for advanced myeloid leukemia and MDS.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-10-11,"Although a combination of i.v. busulfan (Bu) and fludarabine (Flu) is a safe, reduced-toxicity conditioning program for acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS), recurrent leukemia posttransplantation remains a problem. To enhance the conditioning regimen's antileukemic effect, we decided to supplant Flu with clofarabine (Clo), and assayed the interactions of these nucleoside analogs alone and in combination with Bu in Bu-resistant human cell lines in vitro. We found pronounced synergy between each nucleoside and the alkylator but even more enhanced cytotoxic synergy when the nucleoside analogs were combined prior to exposing the cells to Bu. We then designed a 4-arm clinical trial in patients with myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Patients were adaptively randomized as follows: Arm I-Clo:Flu 10:30 mg/m(2), Arm II-20:20 mg/m(2), Arm III-30:10 mg/m(2), and Arm IV-single-agent Clo at 40 mg/m(2). The nucleoside analog(s) were/was infused over 1 hour once daily for 4 days, followed on each day by Bu, infused over 3 hours to a pharmacokinetically targeted daily area under the curve (AUC) of 6000 μMol-min ± 10%. Fifty-one patients have been enrolled with a minimum follow-up exceeding 100 days. There were 32 males and 19 females, with a median age of 45 years (range: 6-59). Nine patients had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (BC: 2, second AP: 3, and tyrosine-kinase inhibitor refractory first chronic phase [CP]: 4). Forty-two patients had AML: 14 were induction failures, 8 in first chemotherapy-refractory relapse, 7 in untreated relapse, 3 in second or subsequent relapse, 4 were in second complete remission (CR), and 3 in second CR without platelet recovery (CRp), 2 were in high-risk CR1. Finally, 1 patient was in first CRp. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was tacrolimus and mini-methorexate (MTX), and those who had an unrelated or 1 antigen-mismatched donor received low-dose rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin™). All patients engrafted. Forty-one patients had active leukemia at the time of transplant, and 35 achieved CR (85%). Twenty of the 42 AML patients and 5 of 9 CML patients are alive with a projected median overall survival (OS) of 23 months. Marrow and blood (T cell) chimerism studies at day +100 revealed that both in the lower-dose Clo groups (groups 1+2) and the higher-dose Clo groups (groups 3+4), the patients had a median of 100% donor (T cell)-derived DNA. There has been no secondary graft failure. In the first 100 days, 1 patient died of pneumonia, and 1 of liver GVHD. We conclude that (1) Clo ± Flu with i.v.

Phase I study of sorafenib in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2010-10-15,"Background Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplication mutation and Raf kinase among others. A phase I dose escalation study of sorafenib was conducted in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. Fifty patients received one of two different schedules; Schedule ""A"": once or twice daily, five days per week, every week for a 21 day cycle, and Schedule ""B"": once or twice daily, for 14 days every 21 days. Dose limiting toxicities were grade 3/4 hypertension, hyperbilirubinemia, and amylase elevation. The recommended phase II dose in hematologic malignancies is 400 mg twice daily for both schedules. Complete remissions or complete remissions with incomplete recovery of platelets were achieved in 5 (10%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Significant reduction in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood blasts was seen in an additional 17 (34%) patients (all with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication). Eleven of these responses (including 3 complete remissions/complete remissions with incomplete recovery) lasted for 2 cycles or beyond. In conclusion, sorafenib is active and well tolerated in acute myelogenous leukemia with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutation. Conclusions Additional studies of sorafenib in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, particularly those with fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication, are warranted, including sorafenib-based combinations.

Dose escalation of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemias.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2010-10-18,"Lenalidomide is effective in myeloma and low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with deletion 5q. We report results of a phase I dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Thirty-one adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and four adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at escalating doses of 25 to 75 mg daily on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to provide pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data. Patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 22 to 79 years) and a median of two prior therapies (range, one to four therapies). The DLT was fatigue; 50 mg/d was the MTD. Infectious complications were frequent. Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally with dose. In AML, five (16%) of 31 patients achieved complete remission (CR); three of three patients with cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR (none with deletion 5q). Response duration ranged from 5.6 to 14 months. All responses occurred in AML with low presenting WBC count. No patient with ALL responded. Two of four patients who received lenalidomide as initial therapy for AML relapse after allogeneic transplantation achieved durable CR after development of cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, without donor leukocyte infusion. Lenalidomide was safely escalated to 50 mg daily for 21 days, every 4 weeks, and was active with relatively low toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Remissions achieved after transplantation suggest a possible immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide, and results provide enthusiasm for further studies in AML, either alone or in combination with conventional agents or other immunotherapies.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3382.0,72.0,Lenalidomide effective myeloma low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes deletion 5q report phase dose-escalation trial lenalidomide relapsed refractory acute leukemia Thirty-one adults acute myeloid leukemia AML adults acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled Lenalidomide given orally escalating doses 25 75 mg daily days 1 21 28-day cycles determine dose-limiting toxicity DLT maximum-tolerated dose MTD provide pharmacokinetic preliminary efficacy Patients median age 63 years range 22 79 years median prior therapies range therapies DLT fatigue 50 mg/d MTD Infectious complications frequent Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally dose AML 16 31 patients achieved complete remission CR patients cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR deletion 5q Response duration ranged 5.6 14 months responses occurred AML low presenting WBC count patient responded patients received lenalidomide initial therapy AML relapse allogeneic transplantation achieved durable CR development cutaneous graft-versus-host disease donor leukocyte infusion Lenalidomide safely escalated 50 mg daily 21 days 4 weeks active relatively low toxicity patients relapsed/refractory AML Remissions achieved transplantation suggest possible immunomodulatory effect lenalidomide provide enthusiasm studies AML combination conventional agents immunotherapies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1288, 16, 323, 4, 2, 154, 43, 2040, 5, 1528, 5460, 21, 414, 99, 1, 8, 124, 70, 61, 1125, 160, 1, 1288, 4, 591, 15, 430, 286, 977, 104, 857, 5, 286, 533, 329, 2, 294, 857, 5, 286, 1275, 62, 11, 346, 1288, 10, 447, 1428, 28, 2922, 415, 1, 243, 6, 481, 81, 391, 23, 162, 14, 298, 239, 1, 339, 218, 410, 6, 223, 3, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 2, 689, 421, 61, 961, 22, 149, 22, 6, 377, 1456, 2, 1676, 209, 74, 7, 42, 8, 52, 89, 1, 676, 60, 184, 350, 6, 842, 60, 2, 8, 52, 1, 100, 324, 235, 184, 104, 6, 294, 235, 3, 2059, 10, 613, 212, 81, 427, 10, 3, 961, 3398, 521, 11, 908, 554, 1288, 1227, 101, 11142, 5, 61, 4, 329, 365, 245, 1, 456, 7, 513, 236, 734, 684, 169, 1, 169, 7, 5, 1266, 1171, 513, 1266, 684, 1292, 5, 1528, 5460, 51, 654, 1869, 29, 33, 49, 6, 213, 53, 62, 253, 489, 4, 329, 5, 154, 1656, 4685, 1276, 77, 69, 5, 62, 2211, 100, 1, 294, 7, 54, 103, 1288, 22, 388, 36, 9, 329, 429, 50, 1063, 497, 513, 1480, 684, 50, 193, 1, 1486, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 187, 1488, 3627, 904, 1288, 10, 2268, 2842, 6, 212, 81, 391, 9, 239, 162, 454, 39, 244, 2, 10, 544, 5, 1352, 154, 155, 4, 7, 5, 591, 430, 329, 3166, 513, 50, 497, 309, 8, 899, 2555, 254, 1, 1288, 2, 99, 377, 8582, 9, 195, 94, 4, 329, 361, 279, 15, 4, 150, 5, 809, 183, 15, 127, 2811]",1716.0,20956622,Dose escalation lenalidomide relapsed refractory acute leukemias,0,0.0

Induction consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-3, cytarabine 1.5 g/m(2) intravenously continuously daily on days 1-4 (days 1-3 if age ≥60 years), and tipifarnib, with the first cohort (n = 6) receiving 200 mg orally twice a day and all others receiving 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 28 days. Consolidation consisted of 5 courses of idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) a day on days 1-2, cytarabine 0.75 g/m(2) a day on days 1-3, and tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 14 days every 4-6 weeks. Maintenance with tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 4-6 weeks was continued for 6 months. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 61 patients achieved complete remission (CR) (64%), and 9 achieved complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) (9%). The median duration of CR was not reached. Median overall survival was 17 months. The most common grade 3 adverse events were gastrointestinal toxicities, liver dysfunction, and skin rash. Compared with historical IA, IA and tipifarnib showed a better CR duration (P = .04) and a trend toward a higher CR rate in patients with chromosome 5/7 abnormalities. The combination of IA and tipifarnib is safe and active.

A Phase 2 study of combination therapy with arsenic trioxide and gemtuzumab ozogamicin in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or secondary acute myeloid leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-10-19,"Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are similar pathobiologically to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in older adults. AML therapies thus may have activity in MDS. In the current study, phase 2 study data of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) in CD33-positive patients with MDS and secondary AML (sAML) were presented. Between June 2004 and February 2006, 30 patients with higher-risk MDS or sAML received ATO (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg intravenously for 5 days during Week 1, then twice weekly during Weeks 2-12) and GO (at a dose of 3 mg/m(2) on Day 8) for 1 or 2 cycles of 12 weeks each. The primary endpoint was response as per MDS or AML International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Adverse events were collected throughout treatment. Patients were followed for a minimum of 3 years for survival. The median patient age was 69 years. A total of 18 patients had MDS, 12 had sAML, and 19 had been previously treated. Seventeen patients (57%) completed ≥1 cycle, and 7 patients (23%) completed 2 cycles. IWG responses occurred in 9 patients (30%) according to IWG MDS criteria (including 2 of 7 patients who failed hypomethylating agents) and 3 of 12 AML patients (25%) according to IWG AML criteria. Grade 3/4 (according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) thrombocytopenia occurred in 47% of patients, neutropenia in 63%, and anemia in 37% of patients. The median overall survival was 9.7 months (28.6 months in responders and 7.6 months in nonresponders; P <.001). Patients who completed 2 cycles of therapy spent a median of 13 days in the hospital. Combination therapy with ATO and GO was found to have acceptable response rates and toxicity, and may be a viable treatment option to standard induction therapy, particularly for patients who fail therapy with hypomethylating agents.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3381.0,27.0,Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes MDS similar pathobiologically acute myeloid leukemia AML particularly older adults AML therapies activity MDS current phase 2 arsenic trioxide ATO gemtuzumab ozogamicin CD33-positive patients MDS secondary AML sAML presented June 2004 February 2006 30 patients higher-risk MDS sAML received ATO dose 0.25 mg/kg intravenously 5 days Week 1 twice weekly Weeks 2-12 dose 3 mg/m 2 Day 8 1 2 cycles 12 weeks primary endpoint response MDS AML International Working Group IWG criteria Adverse events collected treatment Patients followed minimum 3 years survival median patient age 69 years total 18 patients MDS 12 sAML 19 previously treated Seventeen patients 57 completed ≥1 cycle 7 patients 23 completed 2 cycles IWG responses occurred 9 patients 30 according IWG MDS criteria including 2 7 patients failed hypomethylating agents 3 12 AML patients 25 according IWG AML criteria Grade 3/4 according National Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 thrombocytopenia occurred 47 patients neutropenia 63 anemia 37 patients median overall survival 9.7 months 28.6 months responders 7.6 months nonresponders P .001 Patients completed 2 cycles therapy spent median 13 days hospital Combination therapy ATO acceptable response rates toxicity viable treatment option standard induction therapy particularly patients fail therapy hypomethylating agents,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[142, 43, 2040, 1223, 32, 288, 59462, 6, 286, 533, 329, 823, 4, 434, 857, 329, 235, 631, 68, 47, 128, 4, 1223, 4, 3, 291, 45, 124, 18, 45, 74, 1, 3217, 4574, 4021, 2, 7918, 5566, 3537, 4, 6353, 109, 7, 5, 1223, 2, 568, 329, 8991, 11, 917, 59, 1924, 1131, 2, 3010, 1324, 201, 7, 5, 142, 43, 1223, 15, 8991, 103, 4021, 28, 8, 61, 1, 13, 243, 81, 503, 1672, 9, 33, 162, 190, 647, 14, 818, 936, 709, 190, 244, 18, 133, 2, 3537, 28, 8, 61, 1, 27, 81, 188, 18, 23, 218, 66, 9, 14, 15, 18, 410, 1, 133, 244, 296, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 51, 22, 379, 1223, 15, 329, 944, 2644, 87, 14620, 371, 290, 281, 11, 786, 2432, 24, 7, 11, 370, 9, 8, 2499, 1, 27, 60, 9, 25, 3, 52, 69, 89, 10, 790, 60, 8, 181, 1, 203, 7, 42, 1223, 133, 42, 8991, 2, 326, 42, 85, 373, 73, 3591, 7, 696, 781, 3567, 417, 2, 67, 7, 382, 781, 18, 410, 14620, 253, 489, 4, 83, 7, 201, 768, 6, 14620, 1223, 371, 141, 18, 1, 67, 7, 54, 1551, 4931, 183, 2, 27, 1, 133, 329, 7, 243, 768, 6, 14620, 329, 371, 88, 27, 39, 768, 6, 657, 12, 1377, 186, 155, 371, 2256, 27, 13, 1340, 489, 4, 662, 1, 7, 778, 4, 676, 2, 1545, 4, 567, 1, 7, 3, 52, 63, 25, 10, 83, 67, 53, 339, 49, 53, 4, 1983, 2, 67, 49, 53, 4, 4498, 19, 144, 7, 54, 781, 18, 410, 1, 36, 9509, 8, 52, 1, 233, 162, 4, 3, 702, 150, 36, 5, 4021, 2, 3537, 10, 204, 6, 47, 1595, 51, 151, 2, 155, 2, 68, 40, 8, 2663, 24, 1501, 6, 260, 504, 36, 823, 9, 7, 54, 4373, 36, 5, 4931, 183]",1763.0,20960521,Phase 2 combination therapy arsenic trioxide gemtuzumab ozogamicin patients myelodysplastic syndromes secondary acute myeloid leukemia,26,0.04537521815008726

Reduced-intensity conditioning followed by related allografts in hematologic malignancies: long-term outcomes most successful in indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-11-01,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) extends the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to patients with hematologic malignancies unable to withstand myeloablative conditioning. We prospectively analyzed the outcomes of 123 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 23-70 years) with hematologic malignancies treated with a uniform RIC regimen of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation (200 cGy) with or without antithymocyte globulin followed by related donor allogeneic HCT at the University of Minnesota between 2002 and 2008. The cohort included 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 27 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 8 with indolent NHL, 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 10 with myeloma, and 23 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other leukemias, or myeloproliferative disorders. The probability of 4-year overall survival was 73% for patients with indolent NHL, 58% for those with aggressive NHL, 67% for those with HL, 30% for those with AML/MDS, and only 10% for those with myeloma. Corresponding outcomes for relapse in these patients were 0%, 32%, 50%, 33%, and 38%, and those for progression-free survival were 73%, 45%, 27%, 27%, and 10%. The incidence of treatment-related mortality was 14% at day +100 and 22% at 1 year. The incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 38% at day +100, and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 50% at 2 years. Multivariate analysis revealed superior overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with both indolent and aggressive NHL compared with those with AML/MDS, HL, or myeloma. Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality was observed in patients with a Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index score ≥ 3 and in cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients. These results suggest that (1) RIC conditioning was well tolerated by an older, heavily pretreated population; (2) patients with indolent and aggressive NHL respond well to RIC conditioning, highlighting the importance of the graft-versus-lymphoma effect; and (3) additional peri-transplantation manipulations are needed to improve outcomes for patients with AML/MDS or myeloma receiving RIC conditioning before HCT.",Clinical Trial,3368.0,27.0,Reduced-intensity conditioning RIC extends curative potential allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation HCT patients hematologic malignancies unable withstand myeloablative conditioning prospectively outcomes 123 patients median age 57 years range 23-70 years hematologic malignancies treated uniform RIC regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine total-body irradiation 200 cGy antithymocyte globulin followed related donor allogeneic HCT University Minnesota 2002 2008 cohort included 45 patients acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS 27 aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma NHL 8 indolent NHL 10 Hodgkin lymphoma HL 10 myeloma 23 acute lymphocytic leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia leukemias myeloproliferative disorders probability 4-year overall survival 73 patients indolent NHL 58 aggressive NHL 67 HL 30 AML/MDS 10 myeloma Corresponding outcomes relapse patients 0 32 50 33 38 progression-free survival 73 45 27 27 10 incidence treatment-related mortality 14 day +100 22 1 year incidence grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease 38 day +100 chronic graft-versus-host disease 50 2 years Multivariate revealed superior overall survival progression-free survival patients indolent aggressive NHL compared AML/MDS HL myeloma Worse 1-year treatment-related mortality observed patients Hematopoietic Transplantation Comorbidity Index score ≥ 3 cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients suggest 1 RIC conditioning tolerated older heavily pretreated population 2 patients indolent aggressive NHL respond RIC conditioning highlighting importance graft-versus-lymphoma effect 3 additional peri-transplantation manipulations needed improve outcomes patients AML/MDS myeloma receiving RIC conditioning HCT,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"[405, 837, 1933, 3365, 8464, 3, 1075, 174, 1, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 6, 7, 5, 813, 441, 4253, 6, 21330, 3246, 1933, 21, 1143, 311, 3, 123, 1, 2698, 7, 52, 89, 696, 60, 184, 382, 431, 60, 5, 813, 441, 73, 5, 8, 3490, 3365, 477, 1, 1112, 2027, 2, 181, 642, 1104, 1250, 3071, 5, 15, 187, 11016, 7819, 370, 20, 139, 1488, 1063, 1085, 28, 3, 1652, 1, 8297, 59, 1544, 2, 1375, 3, 180, 159, 512, 7, 5, 286, 2194, 329, 15, 681, 1223, 428, 5, 571, 1176, 66, 5, 2316, 1176, 79, 5, 1718, 79, 5, 2, 382, 5, 286, 1193, 442, 2194, 127, 2792, 15, 1997, 3, 1320, 1, 39, 111, 63, 25, 10, 803, 9, 7, 5, 2316, 1176, 717, 9, 135, 5, 571, 1176, 598, 9, 135, 5, 1718, 201, 9, 135, 5, 329, 1223, 2, 158, 79, 9, 135, 5, 1734, 123, 9, 429, 4, 46, 7, 11, 13, 531, 212, 466, 2, 519, 2, 135, 9, 91, 115, 25, 11, 803, 512, 428, 428, 2, 79, 3, 287, 1, 24, 139, 282, 10, 213, 28, 218, 394, 2, 350, 28, 14, 111, 3, 287, 1, 88, 215, 478, 286, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 10, 519, 28, 218, 394, 2, 17, 1, 442, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 10, 212, 28, 18, 60, 331, 65, 553, 1123, 63, 25, 2, 91, 115, 25, 4, 7, 5, 110, 2316, 2, 571, 1176, 72, 5, 135, 5, 329, 1223, 1718, 15, 639, 14, 111, 24, 139, 282, 10, 164, 4, 7, 5, 8, 1007, 31, 497, 1879, 558, 368, 749, 27, 2, 4, 7314, 9909, 2190, 46, 99, 309, 17, 14, 3365, 1933, 10, 149, 421, 20, 35, 434, 2447, 2193, 266, 18, 7, 5, 2316, 2, 571, 1176, 1892, 149, 6, 3365, 1933, 4051, 3, 1187, 1, 3, 1599, 185, 4763, 254, 2, 27, 402, 6164, 497, 13775, 32, 575, 6, 401, 123, 9, 7, 5, 329, 1223, 15, 357, 3365, 1933, 348, 1085]",2091.0,21047561,Reduced-intensity conditioning followed related allografts hematologic malignancies long-term outcomes successful indolent aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas,14,0.02443280977312391
Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome.,BMC medical genetics,BMC Med. Genet.,2010-11-16,"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS.

Clofarabine in leukemia.,Expert review of hematology,Expert Rev Hematol,2010-02-01,"Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analogue that has been synthesized to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best qualities of fludarabine and cladribine. Clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication. Compared with its precursors, clofarabine has an increased resistance to deamination and phosphorolysis, hence better stability, as well as higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in nucleoside phosphorylation. In 1993, the first Phase I study was initiated in patients with hematologic and solid malignancies. Since then, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in pediatric and adult acute leukemia. Owing to its unique properties of biochemical modulation when used in combination with other established antileukemic drugs, mainly cytarabine, combination regimens containing clofarabine are being evaluated. A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials.

Clinical activity of laromustine (Onrigin™) in hematologic malignancies.,Expert review of hematology,Expert Rev Hematol,2009-10-01,"Laromustine (Onrigin™), formerly known as Cloretazine(®) (VNP40101M), belongs to a novel class of alkylating agents--the sulfonylhydrazines--and was selected for clinical development based on its broad anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. Laromustine is metabolized to yield 90CE and methylisocyanate, the former rapidly produces an alkylating, chloroethylating species, similar to the chloroethylating species generated by carmustine. However, several features distinguish laromustine from carmustine and possibly account for their biological differences in vitro and in vivo. The chloroethylating species responsible for laromustine's alkylator effect is relatively specific for guanine and forms a crosslink after incorporation into DNA. Laromustine has significant activity in both older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, including those with very poor-risk disease, and in patients with relapsed disease.

Use of matched unrelated donors compared with matched related donors is associated with lower relapse and superior progression-free survival after reduced-intensity conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2010-12-27,"As success of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) relies primarily on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity, increased minor HLA disparity in unrelated compared to related donors could have a significant impact on transplant outcomes. To assess whether use of unrelated donors (URD) engenders more potent GVL in RIC HSCT compared to matched related donors (MRD), we retrospectively studied 433 consecutive T-replete 6/6 HLA matched URD (n = 246) and MRD (n = 187) RIC HSCT for hematologic malignancies at our institution. Diseases included: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (127), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (71), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (68), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (64), Hodgkin disease (HD) (40), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (25), multiple myeloma (MM) (23), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (12), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7), and other leukemia (1). All received uniform fludarabine and intravenous busulfan conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/mini-methroxate (mini-MTX) or tacrolimus/sirolimus ± mini-MTX. Unrelated donors were younger compared to MRD (median donor age: 33 years versus 52 years, P < .0001), and provided larger CD34(+) products (median CD34(+) cells infused: 8.7 × 10(6)/kg versus 7.5 × 10(6)/kg, P = .002). Distribution of diseases, disease risk, prior transplant, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status was similar in both cohorts. Cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (at day +180), 2-year chronic GVHD, and 2-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 20% versus 16%, 55% versus 50%, and 8% versus 6% in URD and MRD, respectively (P = NS). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was lower in URD, 52% versus 65% (P = .005). With median follow-up of 26.5 and 35.8 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in unrelated donor transplants, 39.5% for URD, and 29% for MRD (P = .01).

Prognostic impact of SNP array karyotyping in myelodysplastic syndromes and related myeloid malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2011-02-01,"Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-As) have emerged as an important tool in the identification of chromosomal defects undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) in hematologic cancers, offering superior resolution of unbalanced chromosomal defects and acquired copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and related cancers share recurrent chromosomal defects and molecular lesions that predict outcomes. We hypothesized that combining SNP-A and MC could improve diagnosis/prognosis and further the molecular characterization of myeloid malignancies. We analyzed MC/SNP-A results from 430 patients (MDS = 250, MDS/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm = 95, acute myeloid leukemia from MDS = 85). The frequency and clinical significance of genomic aberrations was compared between MC and MC plus SNP-A. Combined MC/SNP-A karyotyping lead to higher diagnostic yield of chromosomal defects (74% vs 44%, P < .0001), compared with MC alone, often through detection of novel lesions in patients with normal/noninformative (54%) and abnormal (62%) MC results. Newly detected SNP-A defects contributed to poorer prognosis for patients stratified by current morphologic and clinical risk schemes. The presence and number of new SNP-A detected lesions are independent predictors of overall and event-free survival. The significant diagnostic and prognostic contributions of SNP-A-detected defects in MDS and related diseases underscore the utility of SNP-A when combined with MC in hematologic malignancies.",Journal Article,3276.0,152.0,Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays SNP-As emerged important tool identification chromosomal defects undetected metaphase cytogenetics MC hematologic offering superior resolution unbalanced chromosomal defects acquired copy-neutral loss heterozygosity Myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs related share recurrent chromosomal defects molecular lesions predict outcomes hypothesized combining SNP-A MC improve diagnosis/prognosis molecular characterization myeloid malignancies MC/SNP-A 430 patients MDS 250 MDS/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm 95 acute myeloid leukemia MDS 85 frequency clinical significance genomic aberrations compared MC MC plus SNP-A Combined MC/SNP-A karyotyping lead higher diagnostic yield chromosomal defects 74 vs 44 P .0001 compared MC detection novel lesions patients normal/noninformative 54 abnormal 62 MC Newly detected SNP-A defects contributed poorer prognosis patients stratified current morphologic clinical risk schemes presence number new SNP-A detected lesions independent predictors overall event-free survival significant diagnostic prognostic contributions SNP-A-detected defects MDS related diseases underscore utility SNP-A combined MC hematologic malignancies,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[226, 1579, 1907, 3923, 1845, 22, 47, 2054, 22, 35, 305, 1515, 4, 3, 911, 1, 1860, 2945, 11449, 20, 10569, 2510, 4779, 4, 813, 163, 5846, 1123, 2125, 1, 11947, 1860, 2945, 2, 1294, 1337, 6338, 407, 1, 3963, 2040, 13550, 2, 139, 163, 4349, 387, 1860, 2945, 2, 219, 406, 17, 678, 123, 21, 1237, 17, 1525, 1845, 8, 2, 4779, 359, 401, 147, 356, 2, 195, 3, 219, 2136, 1, 533, 441, 21, 311, 4779, 1845, 8, 99, 29, 10083, 7, 1223, 2039, 1223, 10857, 4526, 2131, 48, 286, 533, 29, 1223, 772, 3, 675, 2, 38, 724, 1, 572, 2152, 10, 72, 59, 4779, 2, 4779, 349, 1845, 8, 397, 4779, 1845, 8, 10406, 1122, 6, 142, 752, 2309, 1, 1860, 2945, 794, 105, 584, 19, 488, 72, 5, 4779, 279, 629, 298, 638, 1, 229, 406, 4, 7, 5, 295, 26057, 667, 2, 1668, 744, 4779, 99, 732, 530, 1845, 8, 2945, 3447, 6, 1769, 356, 9, 7, 1173, 20, 291, 2815, 2, 38, 43, 7103, 3, 463, 2, 207, 1, 217, 1845, 8, 530, 406, 32, 306, 674, 1, 63, 2, 774, 115, 25, 3, 93, 752, 2, 177, 5621, 1, 1845, 8, 530, 2945, 4, 1223, 2, 139, 1342, 5531, 3, 1207, 1, 1845, 8, 198, 397, 5, 4779, 4, 813, 441]",1464.0,21285439,Prognostic impact SNP array karyotyping myelodysplastic syndromes related myeloid malignancies,27,0.04712041884816754
Identification of a risk dependent microRNA expression signature in myelodysplastic syndromes.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2011-02-21,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) display both haematological and biological heterogeneity with variable leukaemia potential. MicroRNAs play an important role in tumour suppression and the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors. Using a microarray platform, we evaluated microRNA expression from 44 patients with MDS and 17 normal controls. We identified a thirteen microRNA signature with statistically significant differential expression between normal and MDS specimens (P < 0·01), including down-regulation of members of the leukaemia-associated MIRLET7 family. A unique signature consisting of 10 microRNAs was closely associated with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category permitting discrimination between lower (Low/Intermediate-1) and higher risk (Intermediate-2/High) disease (P < 0·01). Selective overexpression of MIR181 family members was detected in higher risk MDS, indicating pathogenetic overlap with acute myeloid leukaemia. Survival analysis of an independent cohort of 22 IPSS lower risk MDS patients revealed a median survival of 3·5 years in patients with high expression of MIR181 family compared to 9·3 years in patients with low MIR181 expression (P = 0·002).

The myeloablative reduced-toxicity 4-day regimen i.v. busulfan (Bu) (130 mg/m(2)) and i.v. fludarabine (Flu) (40 mg/m(2)) is associated with low morbidity and mortality. We analyzed 79 patients ≥ 55 years of age (median, 58 years) with AML (n = 63) or MDS (n = 16) treated with i.v. Bu-Flu conditioning regimens between 2001 and 2009 (median follow-up, 24 months). The patients who received this regimen had a good performance status. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rates for patients in first complete remission (CR1), second CR (CR2), or refractory disease and for all patients at time of transplantation were 71%, 44%, 32%, and 46%, respectively; 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rates for patients in CR1, CR2, or refractory disease at time of transplantation and for all patients were 68%, 42%, 30%, and 44%, respectively. One-year transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates for patients who were in CR or who had active disease at the time of transplantation were 19% and 20%, respectively.

Hypomethylating agents for urologic cancers.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2011-03-01,"Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by promoter-region methylation as an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation is increasingly recognized as beneficial in cancer. Initially developed as cytotoxic high-dose therapies, azacitidine and decitabine are now being reinvestigated in lower-dose cancer treatment regimens with a different paradigm - hypomethylation. Recent evidence for benefit in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemias has renewed interest in hypomethylation as a therapeutic option in epithelial cancers. In this article, we describe the mechanistic aspects of DNA methylation, which alters gene expression, and review the evidence for hypomethylation as a therapeutic option in urologic cancers. Potential correlative studies that may assist in developing tailored therapy with hypomethylating agents are reviewed. Given that the population with urologic cancers is typically elderly with multiple comorbidities, the excellent tolerability of lower-dose hypomethylating agents provides a high therapeutic index and rational development is warranted, bearing in mind that the cytostatic and delayed activity present challenges in the choice of appropriate trial end points.",Journal Article,3248.0,3.0,Silencing suppressor promoter-region methylation epigenetic mechanism regulation increasingly recognized beneficial Initially developed cytotoxic high-dose therapies azacitidine decitabine reinvestigated lower-dose treatment regimens different paradigm hypomethylation Recent evidence benefit myelodysplastic syndromes acute myeloid leukemias renewed hypomethylation therapeutic option epithelial article mechanistic aspects DNA methylation alters expression review evidence hypomethylation therapeutic option urologic Potential correlative studies assist developing tailored therapy hypomethylating agents reviewed Given population urologic typically elderly multiple comorbidities excellent tolerability lower-dose hypomethylating agents provides high therapeutic index rational development warranted bearing mind cytostatic delayed activity present challenges choice appropriate trial end points,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2077, 1, 30, 1245, 214, 20, 973, 1053, 569, 22, 35, 1418, 670, 1, 145, 863, 16, 1635, 1904, 22, 2524, 4, 12, 1625, 276, 22, 759, 64, 61, 235, 3752, 2, 3004, 32, 1134, 486, 45274, 4, 280, 61, 12, 24, 472, 5, 8, 338, 2431, 4441, 435, 241, 9, 247, 4, 2040, 2, 286, 533, 2792, 71, 8126, 1333, 4, 4441, 22, 8, 189, 1501, 4, 701, 163, 4, 26, 946, 21, 897, 3, 2716, 2695, 1, 261, 569, 92, 6745, 145, 55, 2, 206, 3, 241, 9, 4441, 22, 8, 189, 1501, 4, 7178, 163, 174, 3679, 94, 17, 68, 3425, 4, 931, 3632, 36, 5, 4931, 183, 32, 446, 447, 17, 3, 266, 5, 7178, 163, 16, 1969, 1216, 5, 232, 1909, 3, 1503, 1543, 1, 280, 61, 4931, 183, 777, 8, 64, 189, 558, 2, 2696, 193, 16, 1197, 1894, 4, 8090, 17, 3, 8154, 2, 1612, 128, 364, 1427, 4, 3, 1866, 1, 870, 160, 396, 862]",1170.0,21417907,Hypomethylating agents urologic,1,0.0017452006980802793
Outcomes after induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndrome.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-11-08,"Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm is associated with a poor prognosis. The authors evaluated predictive factors in patients with secondary AML treated with anthracycline-based induction therapy. This was a retrospective review of secondary AML patients treated with induction therapy. Age, International Prognostic Scoring System, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, cytogenetics, duration of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, and prior MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm treatment were evaluated for their impact on complete response (CR), CR with low platelets, and overall survival (OS). The authors evaluated 61 secondary AML patients who received induction chemotherapy; 59% (36 patients) achieved CR/CR with low platelets (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%-71%), and median OS was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.9-8.1) months. Three factors were associated with lower CR/CR with low platelets and OS: poor risk cytogenetics, prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, and longer time to transformation to AML. Of those treated with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, 32% achieved CR/CR with low platelets versus 78% in the group not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (odds ratio [OR], 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.42). Median OS for those treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide was 3.7 versus 10.5 months for those not treated with a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide (P < .0001). The CR/CR with low platelets rate for those with intermediate risk cytogenetics was 70% versus 35% for those with poor risk (OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.38-13.6). Those with poor risk cytogenetics had a median OS of 2.8 versus 7.5 months for those with intermediate risk (P = .01).

Pharmacokinetic evaluation of decitabine for the treatment of leukemia.,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,2011-05-01,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening malignancy that primarily afflicts an elderly population. Treatment of elderly patients with intensive chemotherapy is associated with high treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, less toxic approaches involving low-dose decitabine-based regimens are being explored in this patient population. This drug evaluation article discusses the rationale for targeting aberrant DNA methylation in hematologic malignancies, in particular the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML. The authors review the pharmacokinetic data gained from low-dose decitabine, as well as the clinical progress of decitabine in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.

The JAK2+ group showed a higher frequency of cytogenetic anomalies than the JAK2- group (23/45 [51%] vs 14/52 [27%]). Chromosome 9, chromosome 7, and 20q- were recurrent abnormalities in the JAK2+ group, whereas 13q- and trisomy 21 were common in the JAK2- group. In the JAK2+ group, chromosome 7 and complex cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with excess blasts/blastic transformation (P < .05), whereas no cases with 20q- underwent blastic transformation.

The low incidence of secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia in children and adolescents treated with dexrazoxane for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a report from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2011-04-20,"Dexrazoxane reduces the risk of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity. In a study of children with Hodgkin lymphoma, the addition of dexrazoxane may have been associated with a higher risk for developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) including acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We determined the incidence of SMNs in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated with dexrazoxane. Between 1996 and 2010, the Dana-Faber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium conducted three consecutive multicentre trials for children with newly diagnosed ALL. In the first (1996-2000), high risk patients were randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin (30mg/m(2)/dose, cumulative dose 300mg/m(2)) preceded by dexrazoxane (300mg/m(2)/dose, 10 doses), or the same dose of doxorubicin without dexrazoxane, during induction and intensification phases. In subsequent trials (2000-2005 and 2005-2010), all high risk and very high risk patients received doxorubicin preceded by dexrazoxane. Cases of SMNs were collected prospectively and were pooled for analysis. The frequency and 5-year cumulative incidence (CI) of SMNs were determined for patients who had received dexrazoxane. Among 553 patients treated with dexrazoxane (1996-2000, N=101; 2000-2005, N=196; and 2005-2010, N=256), the number of SMNs observed by protocol was 0 (median follow-up 9.6years), 0 (median follow-up 5.2years), and 1 (median follow-up 2.1years). The only SMN was a case of AML, which developed in a patient with MLL-rearranged ALL 2.14years after initial diagnosis. The overall 5-year CI of SMNs for all 553 patients was 0.24±0.24%. In a large population of children with high risk ALL who received dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant drug, the occurrence of secondary AML was a rare event.",Journal Article,3198.0,84.0,Dexrazoxane reduces risk anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity children Hodgkin lymphoma addition dexrazoxane associated higher risk developing second malignant neoplasms SMNs including acute myelogenous leukaemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS determined incidence SMNs children adolescents acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated dexrazoxane 1996 2010 Dana-Faber Institute Consortium conducted consecutive multicentre trials children newly diagnosed 1996-2000 high risk patients randomly assigned receive doxorubicin 30mg/m 2 /dose cumulative dose 300mg/m 2 preceded dexrazoxane 300mg/m 2 /dose 10 doses dose doxorubicin dexrazoxane induction intensification phases subsequent trials 2000-2005 2005-2010 high risk high risk patients received doxorubicin preceded dexrazoxane Cases SMNs collected prospectively pooled frequency 5-year cumulative incidence CI SMNs determined patients received dexrazoxane 553 patients treated dexrazoxane 1996-2000 N=101 2000-2005 N=196 2005-2010 N=256 number SMNs observed protocol 0 median follow-up 9.6years 0 median follow-up 5.2years 1 median follow-up 2.1years SMN case AML developed patient MLL-rearranged 2.14years initial diagnosis overall 5-year CI SMNs 553 patients 0.24±0.24 large population children high risk received dexrazoxane cardioprotectant drug occurrence secondary AML rare event,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8473, 2389, 3, 43, 1, 2044, 139, 4404, 4, 8, 45, 1, 541, 5, 3, 352, 1, 8473, 68, 47, 85, 41, 5, 8, 142, 43, 9, 931, 419, 393, 1179, 6580, 141, 286, 2194, 2001, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 21, 509, 3, 287, 1, 6580, 4, 541, 2, 3101, 5, 286, 1275, 2001, 62, 54, 11, 73, 5, 8473, 59, 2648, 2, 1120, 3, 4932, 60051, 12, 1377, 62, 2404, 426, 169, 935, 5761, 143, 9, 541, 5, 732, 265, 62, 4, 3, 157, 2648, 1081, 64, 43, 7, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 856, 30285, 188, 18, 61, 967, 61, 21658, 188, 18, 6083, 20, 8473, 21658, 188, 18, 61, 79, 415, 15, 3, 827, 61, 1, 856, 187, 8473, 190, 504, 2, 5091, 3523, 4, 706, 143, 1081, 1242, 2, 1242, 1120, 62, 64, 43, 2, 923, 64, 43, 7, 103, 856, 6083, 20, 8473, 140, 1, 6580, 11, 786, 1143, 2, 11, 1830, 9, 65, 3, 675, 2, 33, 111, 967, 287, 58, 1, 6580, 11, 509, 9, 7, 54, 42, 103, 8473, 107, 11094, 7, 73, 5, 8473, 2648, 1081, 78, 2338, 1081, 1242, 78, 6369, 2, 1242, 1120, 78, 7162, 3, 207, 1, 6580, 164, 20, 1182, 10, 13, 52, 166, 126, 83, 27052, 13, 52, 166, 126, 33, 15766, 2, 14, 52, 166, 126, 18, 29147, 3, 158, 6474, 10, 8, 473, 1, 329, 92, 276, 4, 8, 69, 5, 3049, 3201, 62, 18, 60052, 50, 388, 147, 3, 63, 33, 111, 58, 1, 6580, 9, 62, 11094, 7, 10, 13, 60053, 259, 4, 8, 375, 266, 1, 541, 5, 64, 43, 62, 54, 103, 8473, 22, 8, 28769, 234, 3, 2291, 1, 568, 329, 10, 8, 622, 774]",1723.0,21514146,low incidence secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia children adolescents treated dexrazoxane acute lymphoblastic leukaemia report Dana-Farber Institute Consortium,0,0.0
"Coalesced multicentric analysis of 2,351 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes indicates an underestimation of poor-risk cytogenetics of myelodysplastic syndromes in the international prognostic scoring system.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-04-25,"The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) remains the most commonly used system for risk classification in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). The IPSS gives more weight to blast count than to cytogenetics. However, previous publications suggested that cytogenetics are underweighted in the IPSS. Here we investigate the prognostic impact of cytogenetic subgroups compared with that of bone marrow blast count in a large, multicentric, international patient cohort. In total, 2,351 patients with MDS who have records in the German-Austrian and the MD Anderson Cancer Center databases were included and analyzed in univariate and multivariate models regarding overall survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The data were analyzed separately for patients treated with supportive care without specific therapy, with AML-like chemotherapy, or with other therapy regimens (low-dose chemotherapy, demethylating agents, immune modulating agents, valproic acid, and cyclosporine). The prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetic findings (as defined by the IPSS classification) on overall survival was as unfavorable as an increased (> 20%) blast count. The hazard ratio (compared with an abnormal karyotype or a bone marrow blast count < 5%) was 3.3 for poor-risk cytogenetics, 4.8 for complex abnormalities harboring chromosomes 5 and/or 7, and 3.1 for a blast count of 21% to 30% (P < .01 for all categories). The predictive power of the IPSS cytogenetic subgroups was unaffected by type of therapy given. The independent prognostic impact of poor-risk cytogenetics on overall survival is equivalent to the impact of high blast counts.

A phase 2 study of lenalidomide monotherapy in patients with deletion 5q acute myeloid leukemia: Southwest Oncology Group Study S0605.,Blood,Blood,2011-05-06,"Older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a chromosome 5q deletion have poor outcomes with conventional chemotherapy. This phase 2 study explored the safety and efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in previously untreated older AML patients with del(5q) who declined standard chemotherapy. Patients were treated with lenalidomide 50 mg daily for 28 days as induction therapy and 10 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among 37 evaluable patients, the median age was 74 years (range, 60-94), 21 (57%) were female, 19 (51%) had prior myelodysplastic syndrome, and 30 (81%) had pretreatment cytogenetic studies evaluated centrally. Six had isolated del(5q), 1 had del(5q) and +8, 23 had complex cytogenetics, and 7 others had del(5q) identified locally. Fourteen patients (38%) completed induction therapy: 7 patients died during induction therapy, 8 had disease progression, 7 had nonfatal adverse events, and 1 entered hospice. Eight patients started maintenance therapy. Five patients (14%) achieved a partial or complete response, 2 with isolated del(5q) and 3 with complex cytogenetics.

Patients received 1 cycle of subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine (75 mg/m2) on the first 7 days of cycle 1, followed by oral azacitidine daily (120 to 600 mg) on the first 7 days of each additional 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were evaluated during cycles 1 and 2. Adverse events and hematologic responses were recorded. Cross-over to SC azacitidine was permitted for nonresponders who received ≥ 6 cycles of oral azacitidine. Overall, 41 patients received SC and oral azacitidine (MDSs, n = 29; CMML, n = 4; AML, n = 8). Dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3/4 diarrhea) occurred at the 600-mg dose and MTD was 480 mg. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were diarrhea (12.2%), nausea (7.3%), vomiting (7.3%), febrile neutropenia (19.5%), and fatigue (9.8%). Azacitidine exposure increased with escalating oral doses. Mean relative oral bioavailability ranged from 6.3% to 20%. Oral and SC azacitidine decreased DNA methylation in blood, with maximum effect at day 15 of each cycle. Hematologic responses occurred in patients with MDSs and CMML. Overall response rate (i.e., complete remission, hematologic improvement, or RBC or platelet transfusion independence) was 35% in previously treated patients and 73% in previously untreated patients.

Clofarabine for myelodysplastic syndromes.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2011-05-19,"Treatment options in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remain limited. The introduction of novel therapies that can improve response rates and survival outcomes in MDS remains a challenge. Clofarabine is a purine nucleoside analog that works primarily via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme with recent evidence suggesting that at low doses it may affect DNA methylation. It has been successfully used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is under investigation in MDS. A PubMed search for articles pertaining to clofarabine was conducted and streamlined to only include data on MDS or AML that evolved from MDS. Also included were clofarabine-related response and safety data from presentations at the 52(nd) Annual American Society of Hematology Meeting in Orlando, Florida, USA. Clinical trials using clofarabine in MDS and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms have produced overall response rates of 31 - 43% including complete responders. Although myelosuppression is an important side effect, clofarabine is generally well tolerated in MDS. Clofarabine is currently available in an intravenous form with an oral formulation presently under investigation, either as a single agent or in combination therapy in MDS.

We enrolled 20 patients with intermediate- to high-risk follicular lymphoma and 2 patients with marginal zone lymphoma. Treatment consisted of 4-6 cycles of FM (fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1-3, mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 28-day cycle). The protocol was amended after enrolling the first 4 patients to include rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1. After 6-8 weeks, responders received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) followed by maintenance rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly × 4 doses, repeated every 6 months for 2 years). After R-FM, the overall response rate was 95% with a complete response rate (CR) of 45% (n = 10), a partial response (PR) rate of 50% (n = 11), and stable disease in 1 patient. Nineteen patients received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan with a 60% conversion rate of PR to CR, resulting in an improved CR of 79% (n = 15) and a PR of 21% (n = 4). Fifteen patients proceeded to rituximab maintenance resulting in 3 patients with PR converting to CR.

We analyzed 72 well-characterized patients with CMML (N = 52) and CMML-derived acute myeloid leukemia (N = 20) for recurrent chromosomal abnormalities with the use of routine cytogenetics and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays along with comprehensive mutational screening. Cytogenetic aberrations were present in 46% of cases, whereas single nucleotide polymorphism array increased the diagnostic yield to 60%. At least 1 mutation was found in 86% of all cases; novel UTX, DNMT3A, and EZH2 mutations were found in 8%, 10%, and 5.5% of patients, respectively. TET2 mutations were present in 49%, ASXL1 in 43%, CBL in 14%, IDH1/2 in 4%, KRAS in 7%, NRAS in 4%, and JAK2 V617F in 1% of patients.

Malignancies occurring during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and other hematologic malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2011-08-16,"Success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has given patients hope for a long disease-free-survival. A longer survival raises the question of late effects, including development of another malignancy. Records of 1445 patients with CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm or other hematologic malignancies treated with TKIs were reviewed to investigate frequency and characteristics of second malignancies (other than acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome). The number of second cancers was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After a median follow-up of 107 months (range, 13-362 months) after CML/myeloproliferative neoplasm diagnosis, 66 patients (4.6%) developed 80 second cancers, including skin (31%), prostate (15%), melanoma (13%), digestive system (10%), kidney (4%), thyroid (4%), breast (3%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (3%), hepatobiliary (3%), and other cancers (14%). Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, 55 second cancers were seen in 51 (3.5%) of all patients treated. The risk of second cancer was lower than expected (observed-to-expected ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.81).

With appropriate contemporary therapy, more than 90% of patients achieve complete remission, and cure rates of approximately 80% and higher response and survival rates can be expected for patients at low and intermediate risk. The introduction of arsenic trioxide, or ATO, in 1994 has provided the opportunity to minimize and even eliminate standard cytotoxic chemotherapy from initial treatment regimens without compromising the excellent outcomes achieved by anthracycline-containing protocols. APL is a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that is curable with targeted therapies and potentially without exposure to conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapy.

Quantitative analyses of DAPK1 methylation in AML and MDS.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2011-11-28,"Aberrant DNA methylation and concomitant transcriptional silencing of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) have been demonstrated to be key pathogenic events in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), however, the presence of elevated DNA methylation levels has been a matter of continued controversy. Several studies demonstrated highly variable frequencies of DAPK1 promoter methylation by the use of methylation-specific PCR (MSP). By quantitative high-resolution assessment, we demonstrate that aberrant DNA methylation is an extremely rare event in this region.

Role of lenalidomide in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.,Seminars in oncology,Semin. Oncol.,2011-10-01,"Lenalidomide is characterized as an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), a second-generation drug in this proprietary drug class with greater potency and a toxicity profile that is distinct from the lead compound, thalidomide. Clinical trials exploring its role in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) revealed unique karyotype-specific activity in patients with interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (del(5q)). This observation ultimately led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve lenalidomide for the treatment of lower risk transfusion-dependent patients with del(5q) MDS. Herein we review the results of four clinical trials conducted with lenalidomide in lower risk MDS, summarizing the clinical efficacy and safety of the drug. We discuss the use of lenalidomide in non-del(5q) patients and efforts to optimize its activity, in addition to investigations exploring the role of lenalidomide in higher risk MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

"Effect of donor-recipient HLA matching at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 on outcomes after umbilical-cord blood transplantation for leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome: a retrospective analysis.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2011-10-06,"The importance of matching at the HLA C locus has not been well defined for unrelated umbilical-cord blood transplantation. The selection algorithm for umbilical-cord blood units generally considers intermediate resolution HLA typing at A and B and allele-level typing at DRB1. We aimed to establish the relative importance of additional matching at HLA C. We used Cox regression to assess retrospectively the effect of donor-recipient HLA matching on outcomes of single umbilical-cord blood transplantations for leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Our primary endpoint was transplant-related mortality. HLA typing was done with molecular techniques with a minimum of intermediate resolution for HLA A, B, and C, and at the allele-level for DRB1. The median age of our study population was 10 years (range <1-62) and 552 (69%) of 803 patients were aged 16 years or younger at transplantation. Compared with transplantations matched at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 (n=69), transplant-related mortality risk was higher after transplantations matched at HLA A, B, and DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=23; HR 3·97, 95% CI 1·27-12·40; p=0·018). Transplant-related mortality risk was also higher after transplantations with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=234; 1·70, 1·06-2·74; p=0·029) compared with transplantations matched at HLA C with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 (n=127). Assessing the overall effect of HLA disparity on transplant-related mortality, risks were higher with units mismatched at two (n=259; 3·27, 1·42-7·54; p=0·006), three (n=253; 3·34, 1·45-7·71; p=0·005), or four (n=75; 3·51, 1·44-8·58; p=0·006) loci compared with matched units (n=69). Our data suggest that the present strategy for umbilical-cord blood unit selection should be reassessed; matching at HLA C for units that are matched at HLA A, B, or DRB1 or in the presence of a single locus mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 should be included to minimise mortality risks.

De novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isochromosome 17q has rarely been reported. The frequency of genetic mutations is unknown. The authors assessed clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of 22 myeloid neoplasms with isolated isochromosome 17q. Fourteen patients presented as MDS/MPN; 8 as de novo AML. Most presented with leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly. Morphologically, all showed myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, including pseudo-Pelger-Huet-like neutrophils, micromegakaryocytic hyperplasia, hypercellularity, fibrosis, and osteosclerosis. Blasts were increased (median, 40% in de novo AML; 9% in MDS/MPN). Immunohistochemical assessment of proliferation and apoptosis rates in AML were similar to a matched group without isochromosome 17q. In most patients, isochromosome 17q occurred at time of blast transformation or disease progression. DNA sequencing revealed no mutation in the uninvolved TP53 allele. Mutational analyses showed rare mutations in NRAS (3 of 10), FLT3 (2 of 16), and JAK2 (1 of 18), and no mutations in NPM1 (0 of 15), KIT (0 of 4), and CEBPA (0 of 4). The median overall survival was 14.5 months for de novo AML, and 11.0 months for MDS/MPN. With a median follow-up of 8.5 months (range, 1.5-107 months), 15 died of disease, 6 had persistent disease, and 1 was in remission after bone marrow transplantation.

Relationship of race/ethnicity and survival after single umbilical cord blood transplantation for adults and children with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2011-11-04,"The relationship of race/ethnicity with outcomes of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is not well known. We analyzed the association between race/ethnicity and outcomes of unrelated single UCBT for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Our retrospective cohort study consisted of 885 adults and children (612 whites, 145 blacks, and 128 Hispanics) who received unrelated single UCBT for leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes between 1995 and 2006 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A 5-6/6 HLA-matched unit with a total nucleated cell count infused of ≥2.5 × 10(7)/kg was given to 40% white and 42% Hispanic, but only 21% black patients. Overall survival at 2 years was 44% for whites, 34% for blacks, and 46% for Hispanics (P = .008). In multivariate analysis adjusting for patient, disease, and treatment factors (including HLA match and cell dose), blacks had inferior overall survival (relative risk of death, 1.31; P = .02), whereas overall survival of Hispanics was similar (relative risk, 1.03; P = .81) to that of whites.

Pathol.,2011-11-11,"This study is focused on therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after the most promising frontline FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) therapy in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. A total of 28 therapy-related myeloid neoplasm patients were identified, including 19 patients from 3 well-controlled FCR frontline trials (n=426 patients), giving an estimated frequency of 4.5% (1.9-8.3%) in a follow-up period of 44 months (range 5-122 months). Clinically, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms could emerge directly from 'prolonged myelosuppression' after FCR (10 patients), or after achieving complete hematological recovery (n=18). The overall latency was 35 months (range 3-118 months), with the former group of 23 months and the latter 42 months (P<0.001). In all, 10 cases presented as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 18 as therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes. Abnormal cytogenetics was present in 26 of 27 (96%) patients, with frequent chromosomes 5 and 7 abnormalities. The median survival was 7 months after therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Our results indicate that the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to frontline FCR therapy may not be as high as previously reported after removing the confounding factor of previous cytotoxic exposure, but this risk increased with older age and likely growth factor co-administration. Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after FCR therapy shares clinicopathological features with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms secondary to other alkylating agents, but has a shorter latency interval indicating possible synergetic effects of the nucleotide analog fludarabine.

"A phase 1 dose-escalation study of ARRY-520, a kinesin spindle protein inhibitor, in patients with advanced myeloid leukemias.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-02,"ARRY-520 selectively inhibits the mitotic kinesin spindle protein (KSP), which leads to abnormal monopolar spindle formation and apoptosis. A phase 1 trial was conducted to establish the safety and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ARRY-520 given as a 1-hour infusion in either a single dose or on a day 1, 3, and 5 divided-dose schedule per cycle in patients with advanced or refractory myeloid leukemias. Additional objectives were to characterize pharmacokinetics, assess preliminary clinical activity, and explore biomarkers of KSP inhibition with ARRY-520. A total of 36 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 34) or myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 2) with a median age of 66 years (range, 21-88 years) were enrolled: 15 in the single-dose schedule (dose levels: 2.5, 3.75, 4.5, and 5.6 mg/m(2)) and 21 in the divided-dose schedule (dose levels: 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 mg/m(2)/day). The MTD was 4.5 mg/m(2) total dose per cycle for both dose schedules. Dose-limiting toxicities included mucositis, exfoliative rash, hand-foot syndrome, and hyperbilirubinemia. Grades 3 or 4 reversible drug-related myelosuppression were observed in 33 of 36 patients. Plasma pharmacokinetic analyses revealed low clearance of ARRY-520 (~3 L/hour), a volume of distribution of ~450 L, and a median terminal half-life of >90 hours. Monopolar spindles were observed in blood mononuclear cells, through use of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain and antitubulin antibodies.

We constructed four claims-based algorithms to assess myeloid leukemia incidence, applied the algorithms to the 1999-2008 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, and assessed algorithm validity using SEER-registered cases. Each had moderate sensitivities (75%-94%) and high specificities (>99.0%), with the 2+BCBM algorithm showing the highest specificity. On the basis of the 2+BCBM algorithm, SEER registered only 50% of the acute myelogenous leukemia cases and a third of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases. The annual incidence of myeloid leukemia in 2005 was 26 per 100,000 persons 66 years or older, much higher than the 15 per 100,000 reported by SEER using the same sample. Our findings suggest underreporting of myeloid leukemias in SEER by a magnitude of 50% to 70% as well as validate and support the use of the 2+BCBM claims algorithm in identifying myeloid leukemia cases. Use of this algorithm identified a high number of uncaptured myeloid leukemia cases, particularly CML cases.

Specific factors associated with poor prognosis have not been investigated in patients with hypocellular MDS. The authors studied a cohort of 253 patients with hypocellular MDS diagnosed at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1993 and 2007 and a cohort of 1725 patients with hyper-/normocellular MDS diagnosed during the same time period. Patients with hypocellular MDS presented more frequently with thrombocytopenia (P < .019), neutropenia (P < .001), low serum β-2 microglobulin (P < .001), increased transfusion dependency (P < .001), and intermediate-2/high-risk disease (57% vs 42%, P = .02) compared with patients with hyper-/normocellular MDS. However, no difference in overall survival was observed between the 2 groups (P = .28). Multivariate analysis identified poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≥2), low hemoglobin (<10 g/dL), unfavorable cytogenetics (-7/7q or complex), increased bone marrow blasts (≥5%), and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (>600 IU/L) as adverse independent factors for survival. A new prognostic model based on these factors was built that segregated patients into 3 distinct risk categories independent of International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score.

"Mutations in the spliceosome machinery, a novel and ubiquitous pathway in leukemogenesis.",Blood,Blood,2012-02-09,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are chronic and often progressive myeloid neoplasms associated with remarkable heterogeneity in the histomorphology and clinical course. Various somatic mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Recently, mutations in a gene encoding a spliceosomal protein, SF3B1, were discovered in a distinct form of MDS with ring sideroblasts. Whole exome sequencing of 15 patients with myeloid neoplasms was performed, and somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes were identified. Sanger sequencing of 310 patients was performed to assess phenotype/genotype associations. To determine the functional effect of spliceosomal mutations, we evaluated pre-mRNA splicing profiles by RNA deep sequencing. We identified additional somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes, including SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2. These mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing patterns. SF3B1 mutations are prevalent in low-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and advanced forms of MDS. SF3B1 mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are predictive for shorter survival. Mutations affecting spliceosomal genes that result in defective splicing are a new leukemogenic pathway.

Oncol.,2012-02-13,"We hypothesized that surrogate markers of host immune response may predict survival in myeloid malignancies. Because of immediate practical applicability, we chose plasma immunoglobulin free light chain (FLC) concentration as the biomarker of interest. Two independent cohorts of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were studied. Kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) FLCs were measured by a quantitative nephelometric assay. Patients with monoclonal FLC were excluded. Values that were above the upper limit of normal for κ or λ FLC were documented in 33% of 240 patients with PMF and 46% of 74 patients with MDS. Increased FLC was significantly associated with increased creatinine, and advanced age in PMF (P < .001) and hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL in MDS (P = .005). In multivariable analysis, increased FLC predicted shortened survival in both PMF and MDS, independent of age, creatinine, and other conventional risk factors. Cutoff levels based on receiver operating characteristic analysis for κ plus λ total FLCs delineated risk groups with highly significant differences in overall survival; International Prognostic Scoring System-adjusted hazard ratio in PMF was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.7), and was 6.3 (95% CI, 2.7 to 16.6) in MDS. No correlations were seen with leukemia-free survival, karyotype, or JAK2, MPL, or IDH mutations. In patients with PMF who were studied by cytokine profiling, the prognostic value of an increased FLC level was independent of that from circulating interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) or IL-8 levels. Increased plasma FLC concentration predicts inferior survival in both PMF and MDS. Its lack of correlation with leukemia-free survival and tumor-specific genetic markers suggests a primarily host-driven biologic phenomenon that might be more broadly applicable.",Journal Article,2899.0,22.0,hypothesized surrogate markers host immune response predict survival myeloid malignancies immediate practical applicability chose plasma immunoglobulin free light chain FLC concentration biomarker independent cohorts patients primary myelofibrosis PMF myelodysplastic syndromes MDS studied Kappa κ lambda λ FLCs measured quantitative nephelometric Patients monoclonal FLC excluded Values upper limit normal κ λ FLC documented 33 240 patients PMF 46 74 patients MDS Increased FLC significantly associated increased creatinine advanced age PMF P .001 hemoglobin 10 g/dL MDS P .005 multivariable increased FLC predicted shortened survival PMF MDS independent age creatinine conventional risk factors Cutoff levels based receiver operating characteristic κ plus λ total FLCs delineated risk groups highly significant differences overall survival International Prognostic Scoring System-adjusted hazard ratio PMF 1.9 95 CI 1.3 2.7 6.3 95 CI 2.7 16.6 MDS correlations seen leukemia-free survival karyotype JAK2 MPL IDH patients PMF studied cytokine profiling prognostic value increased FLC level independent circulating interleukin-2 receptor IL-2R IL-8 levels Increased plasma FLC concentration predicts inferior survival PMF MDS lack correlation leukemia-free survival tumor-specific genetic markers suggests primarily host-driven biologic phenomenon broadly applicable,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 1237, 17, 2592, 525, 1, 1204, 250, 51, 68, 678, 25, 4, 533, 441, 408, 1, 2181, 3320, 5412, 21, 6177, 554, 2593, 115, 1691, 1260, 4266, 1227, 22, 3, 901, 1, 1333, 100, 306, 736, 1, 7, 5, 86, 4637, 7389, 15, 2040, 1223, 11, 656, 3096, 4627, 2, 8561, 12441, 17307, 11, 644, 20, 8, 1156, 38402, 719, 7, 5, 848, 4266, 11, 1800, 1030, 17, 11, 2090, 3, 1726, 2385, 1, 295, 9, 4627, 15, 12441, 4266, 11, 1405, 4, 466, 1, 4263, 7, 5, 7389, 2, 641, 1, 794, 7, 5, 1223, 101, 4266, 10, 97, 41, 5, 101, 3177, 2, 131, 89, 4, 7389, 19, 144, 2, 2222, 299, 76, 79, 499, 1826, 4, 1223, 19, 1614, 4, 658, 65, 101, 4266, 783, 6151, 25, 4, 110, 7389, 2, 1223, 306, 1, 89, 3177, 2, 127, 809, 43, 130, 2779, 148, 90, 23, 3185, 2584, 2037, 65, 9, 4627, 349, 12441, 181, 17307, 5610, 43, 271, 5, 561, 93, 362, 4, 63, 25, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 586, 360, 197, 4, 7389, 10, 14, 83, 48, 58, 14, 27, 6, 18, 67, 2, 10, 49, 27, 48, 58, 18, 67, 6, 245, 49, 4, 1223, 77, 2553, 11, 527, 5, 2647, 115, 25, 3385, 15, 2509, 16440, 15, 3056, 138, 4, 7, 5, 7389, 54, 11, 656, 20, 1675, 1080, 3, 177, 549, 1, 35, 101, 4266, 301, 10, 306, 1, 17, 29, 1033, 1603, 18, 153, 501, 8145, 15, 501, 66, 148, 101, 554, 4266, 1227, 2623, 1663, 25, 4, 110, 7389, 2, 1223, 211, 926, 1, 816, 5, 2647, 115, 25, 2, 30, 112, 336, 525, 844, 8, 1561, 1204, 1621, 1283, 3936, 17, 822, 40, 80, 5482, 3801]",1754.0,22331938,Polyclonal immunoglobulin free light chain levels predict survival myeloid neoplasms,0,0.0
New comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system for primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia after MDS derived from an international database merge.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-02-13,"The karyotype is a strong independent prognostic factor in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Since the implementation of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in 1997, knowledge concerning the prognostic impact of abnormalities has increased substantially. The present study proposes a new and comprehensive cytogenetic scoring system based on an international data collection of 2,902 patients. Patients were included from the German-Austrian MDS Study Group (n = 1,193), the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop (n = 816), the Spanish Hematological Cytogenetics Working Group (n = 849), and the International Working Group on MDS Cytogenetics (n = 44) databases. Patients with primary MDS and oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after MDS treated with supportive care only were evaluated for overall survival (OS) and AML evolution. Internal validation by bootstrap analysis and external validation in an independent patient cohort were performed to confirm the results. In total, 19 cytogenetic categories were defined, providing clear prognostic classification in 91% of all patients. The abnormalities were classified into five prognostic subgroups (P < .001): very good (median OS, 61 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.5; n = 81); good (49 months; HR, 1.0 [reference category]; n = 1,809); intermediate (26 months; HR, 1.6; n = 529); poor (16 months; HR, 2.6; n = 148); and very poor (6 months; HR, 4.2; n = 187).

"Topography, clinical, and genomic correlates of 5q myeloid malignancies revisited.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-02-27,"Interstitial deletions of chromosome 5q are common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), pointing toward the pathogenic role of this region in disease phenotype and clonal evolution. The higher level of resolution of single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping may be used to find cryptic abnormalities and to precisely define the topographic features of the genomic lesions, allowing for more accurate clinical correlations. We analyzed high-density SNP-A karyotyping at diagnosis for a cohort of 1,155 clinically well-annotated patients with malignant myeloid disorders. results: We identified chromosome 5q deletions in 142 (12%) of 1,155 patients and uniparental disomy segments (UPD) in four (0.35%) of 1,155 patients. Patients with deletions involving the centromeric and telomeric extremes of 5q have a more aggressive disease phenotype and additional chromosomal lesions. Lesions not involving the centromeric or telomeric extremes of 5q are not exclusive to 5q- syndrome but can be associated with other less aggressive forms of MDS. In addition, larger 5q deletions are associated with either del(17p) or UPD17p. In 31 of 33 patients with del(5q) AML, either a deletion involving the centromeric and/or telomeric regions or heterozygous mutations in NPM1 or MAML1 located in 5q35 were present.

Cytogenetic and molecular predictors of response in patients with myeloid malignancies without del[5q] treated with lenalidomide.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2012-03-05,"While lenalidomide (LEN) shows high efficacy in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with del[5q], responses can be also seen in patients presenting without del[5q]. We hypothesized that improved detection of chromosomal abnormalities with new karyotyping tools may better predict response to LEN. We have studied clinical, molecular and cytogenetic features of 42 patients with MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) without del[5q] by metaphase cytogenetics (MC) who underwent therapy with LEN. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping marginally increased the diagnostic yield over MC, detecting 2/42 (4.8%) additional cases with del[5q], one of whom were responded to LEN. Responses were more often observed in patients with a normal karyotype by MC (60% vs abnormal MC; 17%, p = .08) and those with gain of chromosome 8 material by either of all 3 karyotyping methods (83% vs all other chromosomal abnormalities; 44% p = .11). However, 5 out of those 6 patients received combined LEN/AZA therapy and it may also suggest those with gain of chromosome 8 material respond well to AZA. The addition of FISH or SNP-A did not improve the predictive value of normal cytogenetics by MC. Mutational analysis of TET2, UTX, CBL, EZH2, ASXL1, TP53, RAS, IDH1/2, and DNMT-3A was performed on 21 of 41 patients, and revealed 13 mutations in 11 patients, but did not show any molecular markers of responsiveness to LEN.

Favorable survival maintained in children who have myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome using reduced-dose chemotherapy on Children's Oncology Group trial A2971: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2012-03-05,"Children who are treated for myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS) experience superior survival compared with children who have myeloid leukemia without DS. To maintain excellent outcomes while avoiding toxicity, the Children's Oncology Group (COG) conducted the phase 3 trial COG A2971, the first trial solely designed to provide uniform treatment of myeloid leukemia in North American children with DS. A2971 eliminated 2 induction drugs and 3 months of maintenance therapy from the standard-timing regimen of dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin/daunomycin (DCTER) used in the previous study (Children's Cancer Group [CCG] 2891). COG A2971 was a multi-institutional, nonrandomized, clinical trial that enrolled 132 patients who had DS with either acute myeloid leukemia (n = 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 41). The median follow-up was 4.8 years (range, 0.8-8.6 years), the median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (range, 0.3-13.6 years), and the median white blood cell count was 6200/μL (range, 900-164,900/μL). The remission rate (92.7% ± 6%) was similar to that reported in the CCG 2891 study (91.3% ± 5%; P = .679). The 5-year event free survival (EFS) rate was 79% ± 7% (vs 77% ± 7% in CCG 2891; P = .589), the disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 89% ± 6% (vs 85% ± 6% in CCG 2891; P = .337), and the overall survival rate was 84% ± 6% (vs 79% ± 7% in CCG 2891; P = .302). Induction day-14 bone marrow response trended toward a more favorable outcome (EFS: P = .12). Age >4 years was an adverse risk factor (5-year EFS rate: 33% ± 38% for children aged >4 years [median, 8.5 years; n = 6] vs 81% ± 7% for children ages 0-4 years [median, 1.7 years; n = 126]; P = .001).

Does iron overload really matter in stem cell transplantation?,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2012-04-04,"A growing body of evidence suggests that iron overload is associated with inferior outcomes after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, all of those studies used surrogate markers of iron overload, especially serum ferritin, and most had a retrospective design. We conducted a prospective observational study in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia undergoing myeloablative HSCT. Forty-five patients who were followed for over 1 year, with serial measurements of serum iron parameters, as well as liver and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. There was no significant increase in ferritin, liver or cardiac iron content in the 12 months following HSCT. Although serum ferritin still appeared to have prognostic significance, as previously reported, pre-HSCT iron overload (as reflected in liver iron content) was not associated with increased mortality, relapse, or graft-versus-host disease.

Alkylating agents have shown activity in leukemia. Bendamustine, an active alkylating agent in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was given in a fractionated twice daily schedule for 4 days to patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Adults with refractory acute leukemia or high-risk MDS were treated with bendamustine at a starting dose of 50 mg/m(2) IV over 1-2 hours twice daily for 4 days. Dose escalations were by 25 mg/m(2) in the 1st 3 levels. The study used the 3 + 3 design. A total of 25 patients were treated. Their median age was 57 years; the median salvage number was 3. Grade 2 creatinine elevations were observed in 1 of 6 patients at the 50 mg/m(2) dose, in 2 of 13 patients at the 75 mg/m(2) dose, and in 3 of 6 patients at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. This was considered significant, even though DLT was not reached. One patient achieved marrow complete remission. Significant reductions of marrow blasts (50% or more) were observed in 6 of 25 patients (24%). Bendamustine fractionated dose level of 100 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days (800 mg/m(2) per course) was associated with Grade 2 renal toxicity. The proposed phase II schedule is 75 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days.

We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk MDS with any chromosome 5 abnormality. Eighteen adults with AML and 9 with high-risk MDS were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at doses 5 to 25 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable adverse event. Median age for all 27 patients was 64 years (range, 39-88 years) with a median of 2 previous therapies (range, 1-6 lines). Two patients (7%) with AML and 5q deletion and +8 cytogenetic abnormality in 2 separate clones achieved complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp). Response durations were 4 and 6 months, respectively. No responses were seen in patients with chromosome 5 abnormality in a complex cytogenetic background.

Clin. Oncol.,2012-05-14,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat with idarubicin and ara-C (cytarabine) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients with previously untreated AML or higher-risk MDS age 15 to 65 years with appropriate organ function and no core-binding factor abnormality were candidates. Induction therapy was vorinostat 500 mg orally three times a day (days 1 to 3), idarubin 12 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) daily × 3 (days 4 to 6), and cytarabine 1.5 g/m(2) IV as a continuous infusion daily for 3 or 4 days (days 4 to 7). Patients in remission could be treated with five cycles of consolidation therapy and up to 12 months of maintenance therapy with single-agent vorinostat. The study was designed to stop early if either excess toxicity or low probability of median event-free survival (EFS) of more than 28 weeks was likely. After a three-patient run-in phase, 75 patients were treated. Median age was 52 years (range, 19 to 65 years), 29 patients (39%) were cytogenetically normal, and 11 (15%) had FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD). No excess vorinostat-related toxicity was observed. Induction mortality was 4%. EFS was 47 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks), and overall survival was 82 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks).

Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes after radiation therapy are similar to de novo disease and differ from other therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-05-14,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) represent a unique clinical syndrome occurring in patients treated with chemotherapy and/or external-beam radiation (XRT) and are characterized by poorer prognosis compared with de novo disease. XRT techniques have evolved in recent years and are associated with significantly reduced bone marrow exposure. The characteristics of post-XRT t-MN in the current era have not been studied. We analyzed patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after XRT alone (47 patients) or cytotoxic chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy (C/CMT, 181 patients) and compared them with patients with de novo MDS or AML (222 patients). We estimated bone marrow exposure to radiation and compared the clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic features and outcome of the XRT patients with the C/CMT patients and with patients with de novo MDS and AML. Patients with t-MN after XRT alone had superior overall survival (P = .006) and lower incidence of high-risk karyotypes (P = .01 for AML and < .001 for MDS) compared with patients in the C/CMT group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in survival or frequency of high-risk karyotypes between the XRT and de novo groups. AML and MDS diagnosed in the past decade in patients after receiving XRT alone differ from t-MN occurring after C/CMT and share genetic features and clinical behavior with de novo AML/MDS.

With recent advances in multi-color flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis, a CD34(+) progenitor-focused 7-color assay was developed and tested in this clinical setting. This assay was first performed in 73 MDS patients and 53 non-MDS patients (developmental set). A number of immunophenotypic changes were differentially observed in these two groups. Based on the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, a core panel of markers was selected for final assessment that included increased total CD34(+) myeloblasts; decreased stage I hematogones; altered CD45/side scatter; altered expression of CD13, CD33, CD34, CD38, CD117, and CD123; aberrant expression of lymphoid or mature myelomonocytic antigens on CD34(+) myeloblasts; and several marked alterations in maturing myelomonocytic cells. The data were translated into a simplified scoring system which was then used in 120 patients with cytopenia(s) secondary to cancer therapy over a 2-year period (validation set).

Overexpression of IL-1 receptor accessory protein in stem and progenitor cells and outcome correlation in AML and MDS.,Blood,Blood,2012-06-21,"Cellular and interpatient heterogeneity and the involvement of different stem and progenitor compartments in leukemogenesis are challenges for the identification of common pathways contributing to the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we used a strategy of parallel transcriptional analysis of phenotypic long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), short-term HSCs, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors from individuals with high-risk (-7/7q-) AML and compared them with the corresponding cell populations from healthy controls. This analysis revealed dysregulated expression of 11 genes, including IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), in all leukemic stem and progenitor cell compartments. IL1RAP protein was found to be overexpressed on the surface of HSCs of AML patients, and marked cells with the -7/7q- anomaly. IL1RAP was also overexpressed on HSCs of patients with normal karyotype AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, suggesting a pervasive role in different disease subtypes. High IL1RAP expression was independently associated with poor overall survival in 3 independent cohorts of AML patients (P = 2.2 × 10(-7)). Knockdown of IL1RAP decreased clonogenicity and increased cell death of AML cells.

The main indications for pleural procedures were possible infection (49%) and respiratory symptoms (48%), and concomitant clinical symptoms included fever (34%), dyspnea (74%), chest pain (24%) and cough (37%). Most patients had active disease (61%). The most frequent etiology of pleural effusions was infection (47%), followed by malignancy (36%). Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 20 × 10(3)/µL) was present in 43% of the procedures, yet the procedural complication rate was only 1.9%. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age, AML, MDS/MPN and active disease status were associated with a shorter median overall survival. Infection and malignant involvement are the most common causes of pleural effusion in patients with acute leukemia or MDS. After optimizing platelet count and coagulopathy, thoracentesis may be performed safely and with high diagnostic yield in this population.

Somatic BAP1 mutations occur in various malignancies. We show that mouse Bap1 gene deletion is lethal during embryogenesis, but systemic or hematopoietic-restricted deletion in adults recapitulates features of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Knockin mice expressing BAP1 with a 3xFlag tag revealed that BAP1 interacts with host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), and the polycomb group proteins ASXL1 and ASXL2 in vivo. OGT and HCF-1 levels were decreased by Bap1 deletion, indicating a critical role for BAP1 in stabilizing these epigenetic regulators.

Epigenetic therapies in MDS and AML.,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.,2013-01-01,"The use of low dose hypomethylating agents for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has had made a significant impact. In the past, therapies for these diseases were limited and patients who elected to receive treatment were subject to highly toxic, inpatient chemotherapeutics, which were often ineffective. In the era of hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine), a patient with high grade MDS or AML with multilineage dysplasia can be offered the alternative of outpatient, relatively low-toxicity therapy. Despite the fact that CR (CR) rates to such agents remain relatively low at 15-20%, a much larger percentage of patients will have clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin, platelet, and neutrophil counts while maintaining good outpatient quality of life. As our clinical experience with azanucleotides expands, questions regarding patient selection, optimal dosing strategy, latency to best response and optimal duration of therapy following disease progression remain, but there is no question that for some patients these agents offer, for a time, an almost miraculous clinical benefit. Ongoing clinical trials in combination and in sequence with conventional therapeutics, with other epigenetically active agents, or in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation continue to provide promise for optimization of these agents for patients with myeloid disease. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for the proven efficacy of these agents remain a matter of some controversy, activity is thought to stem from induction of DNA hypomethylation, direct DNA damage, or possibly even immune modulation; there is no question that they have become a permanent part of the armamentarium against myeloid neoplasms.",Journal Article,2576.0,46.0,use low dose hypomethylating agents patients myelodysplastic syndrome MDS secondary acute myeloid leukemia AML significant impact past therapies diseases limited patients elected receive treatment subject highly toxic inpatient chemotherapeutics ineffective era hypomethylating agents azacitidine decitabine patient high grade MDS AML multilineage dysplasia offered alternative outpatient relatively low-toxicity therapy Despite fact CR CR rates agents remain relatively low 15-20 larger percentage patients clinically significant improvements hemoglobin platelet neutrophil counts maintaining good outpatient quality life clinical experience azanucleotides expands questions patient selection optimal dosing strategy latency best response optimal duration therapy following disease progression remain question patients agents offer time miraculous clinical benefit Ongoing clinical trials combination sequence conventional therapeutics epigenetically active agents conjunction bone marrow transplantation continue provide promise optimization agents patients myeloid disease mechanism responsible proven efficacy agents remain matter controversy activity thought stem induction DNA hypomethylation direct DNA damage possibly immune modulation question permanent armamentarium myeloid neoplasms,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 119, 1, 154, 61, 4931, 183, 9, 7, 5, 681, 1223, 2, 568, 286, 533, 329, 71, 42, 1229, 8, 93, 345, 4, 3, 1219, 235, 9, 46, 1342, 11, 383, 2, 7, 54, 9164, 6, 560, 24, 11, 2974, 6, 561, 1812, 2420, 6097, 92, 11, 629, 3957, 4, 3, 1713, 1, 4931, 183, 3752, 2, 3004, 8, 69, 5, 64, 88, 1223, 15, 329, 5, 12471, 2253, 122, 40, 2216, 3, 1091, 1, 2379, 1352, 154, 155, 36, 550, 3, 1991, 17, 684, 684, 151, 6, 225, 183, 918, 1352, 154, 28, 167, 179, 8, 1802, 1077, 1150, 1, 7, 303, 47, 505, 93, 1474, 4, 2222, 1596, 2, 2595, 1911, 369, 3284, 1178, 2379, 372, 1, 358, 22, 114, 38, 730, 5, 61846, 9365, 1937, 666, 69, 881, 665, 1280, 692, 5301, 6, 824, 51, 2, 665, 654, 1, 36, 366, 34, 91, 918, 84, 125, 16, 77, 2840, 17, 9, 476, 7, 46, 183, 1918, 9, 8, 98, 35, 2214, 47385, 38, 247, 942, 38, 143, 4, 150, 2, 4, 1532, 5, 809, 1943, 5, 127, 8976, 544, 183, 15, 4, 3357, 5, 581, 497, 1906, 6, 377, 1783, 9, 3980, 1, 46, 183, 9, 7, 5, 533, 34, 242, 3, 670, 695, 2327, 9, 3, 1930, 209, 1, 46, 183, 918, 8, 5090, 1, 476, 4089, 128, 16, 2739, 6, 452, 29, 504, 1, 261, 4441, 1196, 261, 1350, 15, 2150, 871, 250, 2356, 125, 16, 77, 2840, 17, 491, 47, 1417, 8, 4377, 760, 1, 3, 5543, 480, 533, 1179]",1722.0,22956506,Epigenetic therapies MDS AML,84,0.14659685863874344
The role of clofarabine in acute myeloid leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2012-09-28,"Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog that has been synthesized to overcome the limitations and incorporate the best qualities of fludarabine and cladribine. Clofarabine acts by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, thereby depleting the amount of intracellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA replication. Compared to its precursors, clofarabine has an increased resistance to deamination and phosphorolysis, and hence better stability as well as higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase (dCyd), the rate-limiting step in nucleoside phosphorylation. Since the initiation of the first phase I study of clofarabine in 1993 in patients with hematologic and solid malignancies, clofarabine has demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity in adult acute leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Due to its unique properties of biochemical modulation when used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, mainly cytarabine, combination regimens containing clofarabine have been evaluated. A review of the English literature was performed that included original articles and related reviews from the MEDLINE (PubMed) database and from abstracts based on the publication of meeting materials.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2012-09-13,"Consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) provides a survival benefit to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have previously reported comparable survival and relapse rates after T cell-depleted (TCD) allo-HSCT compared with unmodified transplantations for acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma with significantly decreased graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We performed a 56-patient retrospective study to evaluate TCD allo-HSCT for the treatment of ALL after myeloablative total body irradiation-based therapy. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates for patients with ALL after TCD allo-HSCT were 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.52) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19-0.44), respectively, and the 2-year and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 0.38 (95% CI, 0.25-0.50) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.20-0.44). There was a trend toward improved survival of patients who underwent TCD allo-HSCT in first complete remission compared with those who did so in other remission states.

Lenalidomide-mediated enhanced translation of C/EBPα-p30 protein up-regulates expression of the antileukemic microRNA-181a in acute myeloid leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2012-10-25,"Recently, we showed that increased miR-181a expression was associated with improved outcomes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Interestingly, miR-181a expression was increased in CN-AML patients harboring CEBPA mutations, which are usually biallelic and associate with better prognosis. CEBPA encodes the C/EBPα transcription factor. We demonstrate here that the presence of N-terminal CEBPA mutations and miR-181a expression are linked. Indeed, the truncated C/EBPα-p30 isoform, which is produced from the N-terminal mutant CEBPA gene or from the differential translation of wild-type CEBPA mRNA and is commonly believed to have no transactivation activity, binds to the miR-181a-1 promoter and up-regulates the microRNA expression. Furthermore, we show that lenalidomide, a drug approved for myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, enhances translation of the C/EBPα-p30 isoform, resulting in higher miR-181a levels. In xenograft mouse models, ectopic miR-181a expression inhibits tumor growth. Similarly, lenalidomide exhibits antitumorigenic activity paralleled by increased miR-181a expression. This regulatory pathway may explain an increased sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy in subsets of AML patients. Altogether, our data provide a potential explanation for the improved clinical outcomes observed in CEBPA-mutated CN-AML patients, and suggest that lenalidomide treatment enhancing the C/EBPα-p30 protein levels and in turn miR-181a may sensitize AML blasts to chemotherapy.",Journal Article,2644.0,49.0,Recently showed increased miR-181a expression associated improved outcomes cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia CN-AML Interestingly miR-181a expression increased CN-AML patients harboring CEBPA usually biallelic associate better prognosis CEBPA encodes C/EBPα transcription factor demonstrate presence N-terminal CEBPA miR-181a expression linked truncated C/EBPα-p30 isoform produced N-terminal CEBPA differential translation wild-type CEBPA mRNA commonly believed transactivation activity binds miR-181a-1 promoter up-regulates microRNA expression Furthermore lenalidomide drug approved myelodysplastic syndromes multiple myeloma enhances translation C/EBPα-p30 isoform resulting higher miR-181a levels xenograft mouse models ectopic miR-181a expression inhibits growth Similarly lenalidomide exhibits antitumorigenic activity paralleled increased miR-181a expression regulatory pathway explain increased sensitivity apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy subsets AML patients Altogether provide potential explanation improved clinical outcomes observed CEBPA-mutated CN-AML patients suggest lenalidomide treatment enhancing C/EBPα-p30 levels turn miR-181a sensitize AML blasts chemotherapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[761, 21, 224, 17, 101, 722, 14652, 55, 10, 41, 5, 231, 123, 4, 7809, 295, 286, 533, 3183, 329, 2873, 722, 14652, 55, 10, 101, 4, 3183, 329, 7, 2105, 7667, 138, 92, 32, 2082, 6435, 2, 6446, 5, 380, 356, 7667, 4322, 3, 256, 12459, 866, 161, 21, 608, 467, 17, 3, 463, 1, 78, 2158, 7667, 138, 2, 722, 14652, 55, 32, 1199, 4462, 3, 6502, 256, 12459, 25023, 3995, 92, 16, 1687, 29, 3, 78, 2158, 620, 7667, 145, 15, 29, 3, 1777, 2691, 1, 955, 267, 7667, 956, 2, 16, 841, 3979, 6, 47, 77, 8355, 128, 3333, 6, 3, 722, 14652, 14, 973, 2, 126, 2468, 3, 3213, 55, 798, 21, 514, 17, 1288, 8, 234, 850, 9, 2040, 2, 232, 2519, 2691, 1, 3, 256, 12459, 25023, 3995, 1113, 4, 142, 722, 14652, 148, 4, 1330, 830, 274, 3647, 722, 14652, 55, 1576, 30, 129, 1813, 1288, 4273, 15958, 128, 10591, 20, 101, 722, 14652, 55, 26, 1253, 308, 68, 2943, 35, 101, 485, 6, 351, 1958, 56, 4, 1890, 1, 329, 7, 6767, 114, 74, 377, 8, 174, 6603, 9, 3, 231, 38, 123, 164, 4, 7667, 1185, 3183, 329, 7, 2, 309, 17, 1288, 24, 2430, 3, 256, 12459, 25023, 178, 148, 2, 4, 3854, 722, 14652, 68, 5745, 329, 2438, 6, 56]",1471.0,23100311,Lenalidomide-mediated enhanced translation C/EBPα-p30 up-regulates expression antileukemic microRNA-181a acute myeloid leukemia,1,0.0017452006980802793

Bortezomib added to daunorubicin and cytarabine during induction therapy and to intermediate-dose cytarabine for consolidation in patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia age 60 to 75 years: CALGB (Alliance) study 10502.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2012-11-05,"The purpose of this study was to determine remission induction frequency when bortezomib was combined with daunorubicin and cytarabine in previously untreated older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and safety of bortezomib in combination with consolidation chemotherapy consisting of intermediate-dose cytarabine (Int-DAC). Ninety-five adults (age 60 to 75 years; median, 67 years) with previously untreated AML (including therapy-related and previous myelodysplastic syndrome) received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) by continuous IV infusion on days 1 through 7. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received up to two courses of consolidation chemotherapy with cytarabine 2 gm/m(2) on days 1 through 5 with bortezomib. Three cohorts with escalating dose levels of bortezomib were tested (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/m(2)). Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed during the first cycle of consolidation. The relationship between cell surface expression of CD74 and clinical outcome was assessed. Frequency of CR was 65% (62 of 95), and 4% of patients (four of 95) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Eleven patients developed grade 3 sensory neuropathy. Bortezomib plus Int-DAC proved tolerable at the highest dose tested. Lower CD74 expression was associated with CR/CRp (P = .04) but not with disease-free or overall survival.

Treatment and outcomes for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia compared to myelodysplastic syndromes in older adults.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2012-11-09,"Prior studies have investigated patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes for older adults with myelodysplastic syndromes, but most failed to distinguish chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Recognizing potentially important differences between the diseases, we undertook a population-based comparison of baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between older adults with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The patients' data were obtained from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry data from 2001-2005, linked to Medicare claims. Baseline characteristics, treatment (red blood cell transfusions, hematopoietic growth factors, hypomethylating agents, chemotherapy or transplantation), progression to acute myeloid leukemia, and overall survival were compared using bivariate techniques. Multivariate logistic regression estimated differences in treatments received. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the effects of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia relative to myelodysplastic syndromes on progression-free survival. A larger proportion of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=792), compared to patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (n=7,385), failed to receive any treatment (25% versus 15%; P<0.0001), or only received red blood cell transfusions (19.8% versus 16.7%; P=0.037). A larger percentage of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (42.6% versus 15.5%, respectively; P<0.0001), with shorter time to progression. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients had a shorter median survival (13.3 versus 23.3 months; P<0.0001) and lower 3-year survival rate (19% versus 36%; P<0.0001). Adjusted estimates, controlling for baseline characteristics and selected treatments, indicate that chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was associated with an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia or death (HR 2.22; P<0.0001), compared to myelodysplastic syndromes. In conclusion, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is less frequently treated in older adults and is associated with worse outcomes, even after controlling for the patients' baseline characteristics and selected treatments.

In vivo quantification of active decitabine-triphosphate metabolite: a novel pharmacoanalytical endpoint for optimization of hypomethylating therapy in acute myeloid leukemia.,The AAPS journal,AAPS J,2012-11-22,"Decitabine (DAC) is used for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Following cellular uptake, DAC is activated to DAC-triphosphate (TP) and incorporated into DNA. Once incorporated into the DNA, DAC-TP binds and inactivates DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), thereby leading to hypomethylation and re-expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes and ultimately antileukemia activity. However, direct evidence of in vivo DAC-TP occurrence in DAC-treated patients has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of suitable validated analytical methodology. Thus, we developed and validated a nonradioactive sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS assay for quantification of DAC-TP. The assay is linear from 50 to 1,000 nM and from 1 to 10 μM and has a lower limit of quantitation of 50 nM and a coefficient of variation for both within- and between-day precision <20%. Following DAC treatment, we detected DAC-TP in parental and DAC-resistant AML cells (in vitro) and bone marrow (BM) and spleen of normal and leukemic mice (in vivo). Downregulation of DNMTs and correlation of DAC-TP concentration with proteins involved in mechanisms of DAC resistance were also demonstrated. The clinical applicability of this method was proven by measuring DAC-TP level in BM and blood mononuclear cells from DAC-treated AML patients. Higher levels are seemingly associated with clinical response. Monitoring the DAC-TP intracellular level may serve as a novel pharmacological endpoint for designing more effective DAC-based regimens.",Journal Article,2616.0,9.0,"Decitabine DAC treatment patients myelodysplastic syndromes acute myeloid leukemia AML Following cellular uptake DAC activated DAC-triphosphate TP incorporated DNA incorporated DNA DAC-TP binds inactivates DNA methyltransferases DNMTs leading hypomethylation re-expression epigenetically silenced suppressor ultimately antileukemia activity direct evidence vivo DAC-TP occurrence DAC-treated patients difficult demonstrate lack suitable validated analytical methodology developed validated nonradioactive sensitive specific LC-MS/MS quantification DAC-TP linear 50 1,000 nM 1 10 μM lower limit quantitation 50 nM coefficient variation within- between-day precision 20 Following DAC treatment detected DAC-TP parental DAC-resistant AML vitro bone marrow BM spleen normal leukemic mice vivo Downregulation DNMTs correlation DAC-TP concentration involved mechanisms DAC resistance demonstrated clinical applicability proven measuring DAC-TP level BM blood mononuclear DAC-treated AML patients Higher levels seemingly associated clinical response Monitoring DAC-TP intracellular level serve novel pharmacological endpoint designing effective DAC-based regimens",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3004, 6140, 16, 95, 9, 24, 1, 7, 5, 2040, 2, 286, 533, 329, 366, 763, 1135, 6140, 16, 735, 6, 6140, 7345, 5907, 2, 2449, 237, 261, 1059, 2449, 237, 3, 261, 6140, 5907, 3333, 2, 14521, 261, 11494, 16486, 2267, 1049, 6, 4441, 2, 1491, 55, 1, 8976, 5442, 30, 1245, 214, 2, 2050, 9169, 128, 137, 1196, 241, 1, 4, 386, 6140, 5907, 2291, 4, 6140, 73, 7, 71, 85, 1740, 6, 608, 520, 6, 8, 926, 1, 2884, 938, 5625, 3209, 631, 21, 276, 2, 938, 8, 31217, 745, 2, 112, 1837, 2307, 2307, 719, 9, 4752, 1, 6140, 5907, 3, 719, 16, 1646, 29, 212, 6, 14, 984, 2878, 2, 29, 14, 6, 79, 4810, 2, 71, 8, 280, 2385, 1, 7887, 1, 212, 2878, 2, 8, 3200, 1, 1380, 9, 110, 262, 2, 59, 218, 2720, 179, 366, 6140, 24, 21, 530, 6140, 5907, 4, 3418, 2, 6140, 436, 329, 37, 4, 439, 2, 581, 1246, 2, 4071, 1, 295, 2, 2015, 399, 4, 386, 2475, 1, 16486, 2, 816, 1, 6140, 5907, 1227, 5, 652, 646, 4, 483, 1, 6140, 251, 11, 120, 264, 3, 38, 5412, 1, 26, 596, 10, 1930, 20, 2978, 6140, 5907, 301, 4, 1246, 2, 315, 3041, 37, 29, 6140, 73, 329, 7, 142, 148, 32, 11405, 41, 5, 38, 51, 1315, 3, 6140, 5907, 2087, 301, 68, 1833, 22, 8, 229, 3419, 1138, 9, 5048, 80, 323, 6140, 90, 472]",1512.0,23180159,vivo quantification active decitabine-triphosphate metabolite novel pharmacoanalytical endpoint optimization hypomethylating therapy acute myeloid leukemia,31,0.05410122164048865
Prognostic factors associated with disease progression and overall survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with decitabine.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2012-12-21,"Decitabine improves overall survival (OS) and reduces risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this retrospective analysis of data from 2 decitabine studies (n = 162), hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 50 10(3)/μL, and lack of chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities predicted longer OS. Identifying potential prognostic factors for survival may guide decitabine treatment decisions and improve outcomes. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in approximately 30% of patients. Identification of risk factors for progression to AML and overall survival (OS) would help guide treatment decisions. We investigated prognostic factors for progression to AML and survival in 163 patients with MDS treated with decitabine 15 mg/m(2) over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks (n = 74) or 20 mg/m(2) over 1 hour daily for 5 days every 4 weeks (n = 89).

Increased CDA expression/activity in males contributes to decreased cytidine analog half-life and likely contributes to worse outcomes with 5-azacytidine or decitabine therapy.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2013-01-03,"The cytidine analogs 5-azacytidine and decitabine, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), produce a molecular epigenetic effect, depletion of DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This action is S-phase dependent. Hence, genetic factors that decrease the half-lives of these drugs could impact efficacy. Documentation of such impact, and elucidation of underlying mechanisms, could lead to improved clinical application. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) rapidly inactivates 5-azacytidine/decitabine. The effect of CDA SNP A79C and gender on CDA expression, enzyme activity, and drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics was examined in mice and humans, and the impact on overall survival (OS) was evaluated in 5-azacytidine/decitabine-treated patients with MDS (n = 90) and cytarabine-treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 76). By high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), plasma CDA activity was decreased as expected in individuals with the SNP A79C. Interestingly and significantly, there was an even larger decrease in females than in males. Explaining this decrease, liver CDA expression was significantly lower in female versus male mice. As expected, decitabine plasma levels, measured by mass spectrometry, were significantly higher in females. In mathematical modeling, the detrimental impact of shorter drug half-life (e.g., in males) was greater in low compared with high S-phase fraction disease (e.g., MDS vs. AML), because in high S-phase fraction disease, even a short exposure treats a major portion of cells. Accordingly, in multivariate analysis, OS was significantly worse in male versus female patients with MDS treated with 5-azacytidine/decitabine.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-02-01,"Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) commonly complicate the care of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT). We developed a modified CLABSI (MCLABSI) definition that attempts to exclude pathogens usually acquired because of disruption of mucosal barriers during the vulnerable neutropenic period following HCT that are generally included under the original definition (OCLABSI). We conducted a retrospective study of all AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT between August 2009 and December 2011 at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 73), identifying both OCLABSI and MCLABSI incidence. The median age at transplantation was 52 years (range, 16 to 70); 34 had a high (≥3) HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI); 34 received bone marrow (BM), 24 received peripheral stem cells (PSC), and 15 received umbilical cord blood cells (UCB). Among these 73 patients, 23 (31.5%) developed OCLABSI, of whom 16 (69.6%) died, and 8 (11%) developed MCLABSI, of whom 7 (87.5%) died. OCLABSI was diagnosed a median of 9 days from HCT: 5 days (range, 2 to 12) for UCB and 78 days (range, 7 to 211) for BM/PSC (P < .001). MCLABSI occurred a median of 12 days from HCT, with similar earlier UCB and later BM/PSC diagnosis (P = .030). Risk factors for OCLABSI in univariate analysis included CBC (P < .001), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch (P = .005), low CD34(+) count (P = .007), low total nucleated cell dose (P = .016), and non-Caucasian race (P = .017). Risk factors for OCLABSI in multivariable analysis were UCB (P < .001) and high HCT-CI (P = .002). There was a significant increase in mortality for both OCLABSI (hazard ratio, 7.14; CI, 3.31 to 15.37; P < .001) and MCLABSI (hazard ratio, 6.44; CI, 2.28 to 18.18; P < .001).

Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2013-02-01,"Metastatic thyroid cancers that are refractory to radioiodine (iodine-131) are associated with a poor prognosis. In mouse models of thyroid cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine. Their effects in humans are not known. We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib. Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including all 5 patients with NRAS mutations. Of the 8 patients treated with radioiodine, 5 had confirmed partial responses and 3 had stable disease; all patients had decreases in serum thyroglobulin levels (mean reduction, 89%). No toxic effects of grade 3 or higher attributable by the investigators to selumetinib were observed.

Systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease: clinical significance and comparison of chomosomal abnormalities in SM and AHNMD components.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2013-03-01,"Some patients with systemic mastocytosis have concurrent hematological neoplasms, designated in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification as systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). In this study, we analyzed 29 patients with SM-AHNMD and compared them to 40 patients with pure SM. The AHNMDs were classified as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (n = 10), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 7), myeloproliferative neoplasms (n = 4), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia/plasma cell neoplasms (n = 7), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 1). Patients with SM-AHNMD were older, more frequently had constitutional symptoms and hematological abnormalities, less often had skin lesions, and had an inferior overall survival compared with pure SM patients (48 months vs. not-reached, P < 0.001). Karyotypic abnormalities were detected in 9/28 (32%) patients with SM-AHNMD but not in pure SM patients (P < 0.001). Combined imaging/ fluorescence-in-situ hybridization performed in four SM-AHNMD cases revealed shared abnormal signals in mast cells and myeloid cells in two patients with SM-CMML and one patient with SM-MDS, but not in the mast cells of a case SM-associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with ATM-deletion. Quantitative mutation analysis showed higher levels of mutant KIT D816V in SM-CMML and SM-MDS than in pure SM (P < 0.001). Our data indicate that the SM-AHNMD category in the WHO classification is heterogeneous, including clonally related and unrelated forms of AHNMD.

Two dosing regimens of tosedostat in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (OPAL): a randomised open-label phase 2 study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2013-02-28,"Tosedostat is a novel oral aminopeptidase inhibitor with clinical activity in a previous phase 1-2 study in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We aimed to compare two dosing regimens of tosedostat. In this randomised phase 2 study, patients aged 60 years or older with AML that had relapsed after a first complete remission lasting less than 12 months, or had achieved no previous complete remission, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive as first salvage tosedostat 120 mg once daily for 6 months or 240 mg once daily for 2 months followed by 120 mg for 4 months. Randomisation was by block method via an interactive web response system using a randomisation schedule generated by an external vendor, with no stratification. The study was open label. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who obtained a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery. Analyses included all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups who received at least one oral dose of tosedostat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00780598. 38 patients were randomly assigned to receive tosedostat 120 mg and 38 to receive the tosedostat 240 mg to 120 mg regimen. 38 patients in the 120 mg group and 35 in the 240 mg to 120 mg group received tosedostat. Seven patients (10%) had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery: two (5%) in the 120 mg group and five (14%) in the 240 mg to 120 mg group. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were febrile neutropenia (11 [29%] patients in the 120 mg group and ten [29%] of the 240 mg to 120 mg group), thrombocytopenia (eight [21%] and eight [23%] patients), fatigue (seven [18%] and eight [23%] patients), dyspnoea (five [13%] and seven [20%] patients), and pneumonia (four [11%] and six [17%] patients). There were five fatal adverse events deemed to be treatment-related: three in the 120 mg group and two in the 240 mg to 120 mg group. The events were acute hepatitis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular dysfunction. Tosedostat, at either dose schedule, has activity in older patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Additional studies of tosedostat including combination with hypomethylating agents and low-dose cytarabine in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and AML are ongoing or planned.

Geriatric assessment predicts survival for older adults receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2013-04-02,"We investigated the predictive value of geriatric assessment (GA) on overall survival (OS) for older adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Consecutive patients ≥ 60 years with newly diagnosed AML and planned intensive chemotherapy were enrolled at a single institution. Pretreatment GA included evaluation of cognition, depression, distress, physical function (PF) (self-reported and objectively measured), and comorbidity. Objective PF was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, timed 4-m walk, chair stands, standing balance) and grip strength. Cox proportional hazards models were fit for each GA measure as a predictor of OS. Among 74 patients, the mean age was 70 years, and 78.4% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≤ 1. OS was significantly shorter for participants who screened positive for impairment in cognition and objectively measured PF. Adjusting for age, gender, ECOG score, cytogenetic risk group, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hemoglobin, impaired cognition (Modified Mini-Mental State Exam < 77) and impaired objective PF (SPPB < 9) were associated with worse OS.

Busulfan dose intensity and outcomes in reduced-intensity allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-04-02,"Comparisons of myeloablative conditioning versus reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) have demonstrated a tradeoff between relapse and toxicity. Dose intensity across RIC regimens vary and may affect treatment outcomes. In this retrospective analysis, we investigated the effect of i.v. busulfan dosing (total dose 3.2 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg) in RIC regimens that combined fludarabine and busulfan on outcomes in patients who were undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total of 217 consecutive patients with MDS or AML underwent first busulfan and fludarabine RIC peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from well-matched related or unrelated donors at our institutions between 2004 and 2009. Of the 217 patients, 135 patients received Bu1 (3.2 mg/kg of busulfan) and 82 patients received Bu2 (6.4 mg/kg of busulfan), both with daily fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days). The choice of RIC regimen was based on temporal institutional standard, enrollment on protocols, and physician choice. Patients had similar characteristics with a few notable differences: Patients who received Bu1 were younger (median age 61 versus 64 years, P < . 001), received more single-antigen mismatched unrelated grafts (14.1% versus 1.2%, P < . 001), received more sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens (63% versus 45%, P < .0001), received less antithymocyte globulin for GVHD prophylaxis (0% versus 22%, P < .001), and had less enrollment on a clinical trial that used prophylactic rituximab for the prevention of chronic GVHD (2.2% versus 11.0%, P = .011). Clinical disease status was similar between the groups. Median follow-up for survivors was 4.4 years for Bu1 and 3.2 years for Bu2. Because of the differences in characteristics, the 2 groups were compared with the adjustment of a propensity score that predicted Bu2 to account for measured differences. The day +200 cumulative incidence rates of grades II to IV acute GVHD (Bu1, 17%, versus Bu2, 8.5%; hazard ratio [HR], .56; 95% confidence interval [CI], .22 to 1.41; P = .22) or grades III to IV acute GVHD (Bu1, 6.7%, versus Bu2, 4.9%) were not different. The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was not significantly different between Bu1 and Bu2 (41.5% versus 28%, respectively; HR, .70; CI, .42 to 1.17; P = .09). Two-year nonrelapse mortality rates were similar for Bu1 and Bu2 (8.9% versus 9.8%, respectively; HR, .80; CI, .29 to 2.21; P = .67). Two-year progression-free survival and overall survival were also similar between Bu1 and Bu2 (progression-free survival: 40.6% versus 39.3%, respectively; HR, .82; CI, .57 to 1.30; P = .33; and overall survival: 47.4% versus 48.8%, respectively; HR, .96; CI, .64 to 1.44; P = .85). Subset analysis defined by clinical disease and cytogenetic risk with the propensity risk score applied suggest that in patients with high clinical disease risk and nonadverse cytogenetics, the higher dose busulfan RIC regimen may be of marginal benefit (2-year progression-free survival: HR, .54; CI, .29 to 1.03; P = .062). For the majority of patients with MDS or AML undergoing busulfan and fludarabine RIC peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, however, the dose of busulfan (3.2 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg) is not

Second malignant neoplasms after treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2013-05-20,"Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) after diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are rare events. We analyzed data on risk factors and outcomes of 642 children with SMNs occurring after treatment for ALL from 18 collaborative study groups between 1980 and 2007. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 186), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 69), and nonmeningioma brain tumor (n = 116) were the most common types of SMNs and had the poorest outcome (5-year survival rate, 18.1% ± 2.9%, 31.1% ± 6.2%, and 18.3% ± 3.8%, respectively). Five-year survival estimates for AML were 11.2% ± 2.9% for 125 patients diagnosed before 2000 and 34.1% ± 6.3% for 61 patients diagnosed after 2000 (P < .001); 5-year survival estimates for MDS were 17.1% ± 6.4% (n = 36) and 48.2% ± 10.6% (n = 33; P = .005). Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation failed to improve outcome of secondary myeloid malignancies after adjusting for waiting time to transplantation. Five-year survival rates were above 90% for patients with meningioma, Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and parotid gland tumor, and 68.5% ± 6.4% for those with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighty-nine percent of patients with brain tumors had received cranial irradiation.

Vatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584; Novartis and Schering AG) inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet derived growth factor and c-Kit. We examined whether vatalanib induces hematological responses in MDS and/or delays progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death. Two cohorts were studied. Vatalanib 1250 mg orally was given once daily (cohort 1) or 750-1250 mg once daily in an intra-patient dose escalating schedule (cohort 2) in 28-day cycles to 155 patients with MDS; 142 patients were evaluable for response and 153 for toxicity. The median age was 70.5 years; 51 % had low risk (International Prognostic Scoring System {IPSS} Low/Intermediate-1) and 32 % had high risk (IPSS Intermediate-2/High) MDS. Hematological improvement was achieved in 7/142 (5 %) patients; all 7 were among the 47 patients able to remain on vatalanib for at least 3 months (hematological improvement achieved in 15 % of these 47 patients). For patients with low risk and high risk MDS, respectively, median progression-free survivals were 15 and 6 months, median times to transformation to AML were 28 and 6 months, and median overall survivals were 36 and 10 months. The most frequent non-hematological adverse events grade ≥ 2 were fatigue, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, anorexia, ataxia, diarrhea, and pain. Two deaths (one intra-cerebral hemorrhage and one sudden death) were possibly related to vatalanib. Vatalanib induces improvement in blood counts in a small proportion of MDS patients.

Clin. Oncol.,2013-05-28,"Over the past four decades, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) has evolved as a curative modality for patients with hematologic diseases. This study describes changes in use, technique, and survival in a population-based cohort. The study included 38,060 patients with hematologic malignancies or disorders who underwent first alloHCT in a US or Canadian center from 1994 to 2005 and were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. AlloHCT as treatment for acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid leukemias (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas increased by 45%, from 2,520 to 3,668 patients annually. From 1994 to 2005, use of both peripheral (7% to 63%) [corrected] and cord blood increased (2% to 10%), whereas use of marrow decreased (90% to 27%). Despite a median age increase from 33 to 40 years and 165% [corrected] increase in unrelated donors for alloHCT, overall survival (OS) at day 100 significantly improved for patients with AML in first complete remission after myeloablative sibling alloHCT (85% to 94%; P < .001) and unrelated alloHCT (63% to 86%; P < .001); 1-year OS improved among those undergoing unrelated alloHCT (48% to 63%; P = .003) but not among those undergoing sibling alloHCT. Similar results were seen for ALL and MDS. Day-100 OS after cord blood alloHCT improved significantly from 60% to 78% (P < .001) for AML, ALL, MDS, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Use of reduced-intensity regimens increased, yielding OS rates similar to those of myeloablative regimens. Survival for those undergoing alloHCT has significantly improved over time.

Acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with IPSS defined lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with poor prognosis and transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2013-07-23,"We hypothesized that the dynamic acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA) during the follow up of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) could be associated with poor prognosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 365 patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 risk MDS who had at least two consecutive cytogenetic analyses during the follow up. Acquisition of cytogenetic abnormalities was detected in 107 patients (29%). The most frequent alteration involved chromosome 7 in 21% of ACA cases. Median transformation-free and overall survival for patients with and without ACA were 13 vs. 52 months (P = 0.01) and 17 vs. 62 months (P = 0.01), respectively. By fitting ACA as a time-dependent covariate, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with ACA had increased risk of transformation (HR = 1.40; P = 0.03) or death (HR = 1.45; P = 0.02). Notably, female patients with therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) had an increased risk of developing ACA (OR = 5.26; P < 0.0001), although subgroup analysis showed that prognostic impact of ACA was not evident in t-MDS.

Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with del(5q): is sequential azacitidine-lenalidomide combination the way to go?,Expert review of hematology,Expert Rev Hematol,2013-06-01,"High-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with deletions of long arm of chromosome 5 (del[5q]) are characterized by rapid progression and poor survival. The majority of these patients are elderly with comorbidities, therefore limiting the use of intensive therapies which, even if used, unfortunately yield low responses. While azacitidine prolongs survival in patients with HR-MDS by a median of 9.5 months, responses only occur in less than half of the patients, and azacitidine therapy is not curative, with most patients relapsing within 2 years. Therefore, strategies to improve outcomes in these patients are needed. Azacitidine and lenalidomide both have meaningful single-agent clinical activity in HR-MDS and AML with del(5q). Early-phase trials in HR-MDS without del(5q) suggest increased activity with a concurrent azacitidine-lenalidomide combination.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-18,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can achieve durable remissions in a number of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Little is known about the safety of HSCT in patients age 70 or older. Consecutive patients (n = 54) age 70 or older underwent HSCT between 2007 and 2012. Diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 25), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 4), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 3), myeloproliferative neoplasm (n = 4), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 1). Median follow-up for survivors was 21 months. All patients received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, primarily busulfan/fludarabine. All patients received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cell grafts: 44 from 8/8 matched unrelated donors, 8 from matched related donors, and 2 from 7/8 matched unrelated donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was calcineurin inhibitor-based in all patients. The median age at transplantation was 71 years (range, 70 to 76); the median HCT comorbidity index score was 1 (range, 0 to 5). Two patients died before hematopoietic recovery (1 with graft failure and 1 with disease progression), and 1 patient relapsed before hematopoietic recovery; otherwise, all engrafted with median donor chimerism of 94% at 1 month. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 13% and of grades III to IV acute GVHD, 9.3%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 36%, progression-free survival was 39%, overall survival was 39%, and relapse was 56%.

Unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is underused as a curative therapy in eligible patients from the United States.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2013-06-25,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is a curative therapy for hematologic disorders including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic and myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. To determine the utilization of alloHCT from unrelated donors (URDs) in the United States, we calculated the number of patients diagnosed with hematologic disorders age 20 to 74 years based on 2004 to 2008 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results and 2007 US Census data, estimated the percentage of patients who would be eligible for URD alloHCT after discounting the mortality rate during induction therapy and the rate of severe comorbidities, and compared these with the actual 2007 alloHCTs facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. We found that the number of URD alloHCT as a percentage of the estimated potential transplantations ranged from 11% for multiple myeloma to 54% for chronic myeloid leukemia, with an average percentage of 26% for all the disorders considered. In an analysis stratified by age groups (20 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 to 74 years), the utilization of URD alloHCT was higher in younger patients than in older patients for all disorders. Of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patients, approximately 66% underwent URD alloHCT later in the course of their disease (in second or greater complete remission). URD alloHCT is likely underused for potentially curable hematologic disorders, particularly in older patients. Understanding the reasons for low use of alloHCT may lead to strategies to expand the use of this curative therapy for more patients with hematologic disorders.

Somatic SETBP1 mutations in myeloid malignancies.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2013-07-07,"Here we report whole-exome sequencing of individuals with various myeloid malignancies and identify recurrent somatic mutations in SETBP1, consistent with a recent report on atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Closely positioned somatic SETBP1 mutations encoding changes in Asp868, Ser869, Gly870, Ile871 and Asp880, which match germline mutations in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS), were detected in 17% of secondary acute myeloid leukemias (sAML) and 15% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) cases. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. Mutant cases were associated with advanced age and monosomy 7/deletion 7q (-7/del(7q)) constituting poor prognostic factors. Analysis of serially collected samples indicated that SETBP1 mutations were acquired during leukemic evolution.

We took advantage of the recent description of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations in LGL clonal expansions to test, using sensitive methods, for the presence of these mutations in a large cohort of 367 MDS and 140 AA cases. STAT3 clones can be found not only in known LGL concomitant cases, but in a small proportion of unsuspected ones (7% AA and 2.5% MDS). In STAT3-mutated AA patients, an interesting trend toward better responses of immunosuppressive therapy and an association with the presence of human leukocyte antigen-DR15 were found. MDSs harboring a STAT3 mutant clone showed a lower degree of bone marrow cellularity and a higher frequency of developing chromosome 7 abnormalities.

Hematol.,2013-09-30,"Distinguishing blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is gaining increased importance because of emerging differences in therapeutic approaches, and this distinction can be problematic in bone marrow specimens. We identified retrospectively 16 patients with bone marrow involvement by BPDCN: 11 men and 5 women with a median age of 62.5 years (range, 19-86 years). Myelodysplastic changes were observed in five patients. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for CD4, CD123, TCL-1, and HLA-DR and were negative for CD3, CD8, CD13, CD19, CD34, and myeloperoxidase. Other antigens expressed by subsets of BPDCN cases included the following: CD56 (13/15; 81%), CD33 (7/10; 70%), CD7 (11/14; 69%), TdT (5/15; 33%), CD2 (5/11; 31%), CD117 (2/9; 22%), and CD5 (2/13; 15%). Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed chromosomal abnormalities in 6 of 13 (46%) cases analyzed, of which 3 cases had -13/13q-. Targeted next-generation sequencing performed on five BPDCN cases identified TET2 (ten eleven translocation 2) mutations and no other AML-associated mutations. In conclusion, BPDCN in the bone marrow has a characteristic immunoprofile (CD4+, CD56+, CD123+, and TCL-1+) and appears to be commonly associated with myelodysplastic features and a high frequency of TET2 mutations in the absence of other mutations commonly observed in AML.",Journal Article,2304.0,58.0,Distinguishing blastic plasmacytoid dendritic neoplasm BPDCN acute myeloid leukemia AML gaining increased importance emerging differences therapeutic approaches distinction problematic bone marrow specimens identified retrospectively 16 patients bone marrow involvement BPDCN 11 men 5 women median age 62.5 years range 19-86 years Myelodysplastic changes observed patients Immunophenotypic showed neoplastic positive CD4 CD123 TCL-1 HLA-DR negative CD3 CD8 CD13 CD19 CD34 myeloperoxidase antigens expressed subsets BPDCN cases included following CD56 13/15 81 CD33 7/10 70 CD7 11/14 69 TdT 5/15 33 CD2 5/11 31 CD117 2/9 22 CD5 2/13 15 Conventional cytogenetic showed chromosomal abnormalities 6 13 46 cases 3 cases -13/13q- Targeted next-generation sequencing performed BPDCN cases identified TET2 translocation 2 AML-associated BPDCN bone marrow characteristic immunoprofile CD4+ CD56+ CD123+ TCL-1+ appears commonly associated myelodysplastic features high frequency TET2 absence commonly observed AML,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4508, 6529, 7978, 2464, 31, 2131, 8556, 29, 286, 533, 329, 16, 7312, 101, 1187, 408, 1, 1478, 362, 4, 189, 611, 2, 26, 6628, 122, 40, 6594, 4, 581, 623, 21, 108, 894, 245, 7, 5, 581, 799, 20, 8556, 175, 325, 2, 33, 117, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 744, 33, 60, 184, 326, 868, 60, 400, 11, 164, 4, 365, 7, 6599, 65, 224, 17, 3, 2000, 37, 11, 109, 9, 1440, 8849, 8885, 14, 2, 1160, 3436, 2, 11, 199, 9, 3117, 968, 13518, 3158, 2215, 2, 16722, 127, 1575, 570, 20, 1890, 1, 8556, 140, 159, 3, 366, 5803, 233, 167, 865, 6353, 67, 79, 431, 13217, 175, 213, 790, 10970, 33, 167, 466, 11048, 33, 175, 456, 6999, 18, 83, 350, 2, 6349, 18, 233, 167, 809, 1266, 65, 224, 1860, 1171, 4, 49, 1, 233, 641, 140, 311, 1, 92, 27, 140, 42, 233, 8453, 238, 1305, 914, 615, 173, 23, 365, 8556, 140, 108, 5038, 1618, 2627, 2006, 18, 138, 2, 77, 127, 329, 41, 138, 4, 1221, 8556, 4, 3, 581, 71, 8, 2037, 31332, 1440, 5803, 8849, 2, 8885, 14, 2, 1233, 6, 40, 841, 41, 5, 404, 2, 8, 64, 675, 1, 5038, 138, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 127, 138, 841, 164, 4, 329]",1288.0,23940084,TET2 myelodysplastic features distinct immunoprofile characterize blastic plasmacytoid dendritic neoplasm bone marrow,3,0.005235602094240838

Next-generation sequencing-based multigene mutational screening for acute myeloid leukemia using MiSeq: applicability for diagnostics and disease monitoring.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2013-10-18,"Routine molecular testing in acute myeloid leukemia involves screening several genes of therapeutic and prognostic significance for mutations. A comprehensive analysis using single-gene assays requires large amounts of DNA, is cumbersome and timely consolidation of results for clinical reporting is challenging. High throughput, next-generation sequencing platforms widely used in research have not been tested vigorously for clinical application. Here we describe the clinical application of MiSeq, a next-generation sequencing platform to screen mutational hotspots in 54 cancer-related genes including genes relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KIT and EZH2). We sequenced 63 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome using MiSeq and compared the results with those obtained using another next-generation sequencing platform, Ion-Torrent Personal Genome Machine and other conventional testing platforms. MiSeq detected a total of 100 single nucleotide variants and 23 NPM1 insertions that were confirmed by Ion Torrent or conventional platforms, indicating complete concordance. FLT3-internal tandem duplications (n=10) were not detected; however, re-analysis of the MiSeq output by Pindel, an indel detection algorithm, did detect them. Dilution studies of cancer cell-line DNA showed that the quantitative accuracy of mutation detection was up to an allelic frequency of 1.5% with a high level of inter- and intra-run assay reproducibility, suggesting potential utility for monitoring response to therapy, clonal heterogeneity and evolution.

Making sense of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms overlap syndromes.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2014-03-01,"Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs), including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, MDS/MPN-Unclassifiable, ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, are clonal hematologic diseases characterized by myeloid dysplasia, proliferation, and absence of the molecular lesions BCR/ABL, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration approved therapies for all MDS/MPN subtypes. Advances in the understanding of the biologic and molecular drivers of these diseases will help in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. This review article summarizes the molecular aspects of MDS/MPNs and provides an overview of classic and emerging therapies. Next generation sequencing has provided new insights into the genetic nature of MDS/MPNs. Molecular mutations such as TET2, CBL, SETBP1, CSF3R, and SF3B1 are relevant as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Hematopoietic cell transplantation, although potentially curative, is applicable to only a small proportion of patients. Attempts to standardize response and outcomes criteria specific to MDS/MPN and clinical trials using novel agents focused on MDS/MPN patients are underway.

"Haploinsufficiency of del(5q) genes, Egr1 and Apc, cooperate with Tp53 loss to induce acute myeloid leukemia in mice.",Blood,Blood,2013-12-31,"An interstitial deletion of chromosome 5, del(5q), is the most common structural abnormality in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) after cytotoxic therapy. Loss of TP53 activity, through mutation or deletion, is highly associated with t-MNs with a del(5q). We previously demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of Egr1 and Apc, 2 genes lost in the 5q deletion, are key players in the progression of MDS with a del(5q). Using genetically engineered mice, we now show that reduction or loss of Tp53 expression, in combination with Egr1 haploinsufficiency, increased the rate of development of hematologic neoplasms and influenced the disease spectrum, but did not lead to overt myeloid leukemia, suggesting that altered function of additional gene(s) on 5q are likely required for myeloid leukemia development. Next, we demonstrated that cell intrinsic loss of Tp53 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells haploinsufficient for both Egr1 and Apc led to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 17% of mice. The long latency (234-299 days) and clonal chromosomal abnormalities in the AMLs suggest that additional genetic changes may be required for full transformation. Thus, loss of Tp53 activity in cooperation with Egr1 and Apc haploinsufficiency creates an environment that is permissive for malignant transformation and the development of AML.

Decitabine induces delayed reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in leukemia cells and induces the expression of ROS generating enzymes.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-01-14,"Azanucleoside DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. The relative contributions of DNMT inhibition and other off-target effects to their clinical efficacy remain unclear. Data correlating DNA methylation reversal and clinical response have been conflicting. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate so-called off-target effects and their impact on cell survival and differentiation. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation analysis. Gene expression analysis was performed using real-time PCR. DNA methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using JC-1 dye staining. Western blotting was used for quantitative protein expression analysis. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukemia cells. p53 expression was dispensable for DAC-induced apoptosis. DAC induced delayed ROS accumulation in leukemia cells but not in solid tumor cells and p53 expression was dispensable for ROS increase. ROS increase was deoxycytidine kinase dependent, indicating that incorporation of DAC into nuclear DNA is required for ROS generation.

Leukaemogenesis induced by an activating β-catenin mutation in osteoblasts.,Nature,Nature,2014-01-15,"Cells of the osteoblast lineage affect the homing and the number of long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells, haematopoietic stem cell mobilization and lineage determination and B cell lymphopoiesis. Osteoblasts were recently implicated in pre-leukaemic conditions in mice. However, a single genetic change in osteoblasts that can induce leukaemogenesis has not been shown. Here we show that an activating mutation of β-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated β-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway. In 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, increased β-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation was identified in osteoblasts and these patients showed increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that genetic alterations in osteoblasts can induce acute myeloid leukaemia, identify molecular signals leading to this transformation and suggest a potential novel pharmacotherapeutic approach to acute myeloid leukaemia.

"The bone marrow niche, stem cells, and leukemia: impact of drugs, chemicals, and the environment.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,2014-02-04,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a unique population of somatic stem cells that can both self-renew for long-term reconstitution of HSCs and differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), which in turn give rise, in a hierarchical manner, to the entire myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The differentiation and maturation of these lineages occurs in the bone marrow (BM) niche, a microenvironment that regulates self-renewal, survival, differentiation, and proliferation, with interactions among signaling pathways in the HSCs and the niche required to establish and maintain homeostasis. The accumulation of genetic mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities within cells of the partially differentiated myeloid lineage, particularly as a result of exposure to benzene or cytotoxic anticancer drugs, can give rise to malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Better understanding of the mechanisms driving these malignancies and susceptibility factors, both within HPCs and cells within the BM niche, may lead to the development of strategies for prevention of occupational and cancer therapy-induced disease.

Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2013-10-01,"Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) are late complications of cytotoxic therapies used to treat malignant, and increasingly, non-malignant conditions. Although distinct clinical, morphologic, and genetic features can be recognized, these disorders should be seen as part of a single disease spectrum recognized by the WHO in a singular classification, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). Etiologic factors for t-MNs remain elusive, but ongoing research has characterized risk factors which vary between patient subgroups and exposures. Agents that damage DNA directly, interfere with DNA repair, and suppress the immune system's ability to detect malignant cells increase the risk of t-MNs. As in primary MDS and de novo AML, prognosis and treatment strategies rely on patient characteristics as well as cytogenetics. However, the overall outcome for patients with t-MNs remains poor. Here we review our current understanding of t-MNs as they are most often encountered by the practicing clinician.

Risk for developing myelodysplastic syndromes in prostate cancer patients definitively treated with radiation.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-02-27,"Exposure to ionizing radiation has been linked to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); it is not clear whether therapeutic radiation doses used for prostate cancer pose an increased MDS risk. We performed a retrospective cohort study of prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2011 at Cleveland Clinic, comparing those who underwent definitive treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP) to radiotherapy either external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or prostate interstitial brachytherapy (PI) and to population-based registries. Competing risk regression analyses were used to determine the cumulative risk of developing MDS. All statistical tests were two-sided. Of 10924 patients, 5119 (47%) received radiation (n = 2183 [43%] in EBRT group and n = 2936 [57%] in PI group) and 5805 (53%) were treated with RP. Overall, 31 cases of MDS were observed, with age-adjusted incidence rates no higher than in population-based registries. In univariate analyses, advancing age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.20; P < .001) and radiotherapy exposure (HR = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.41 to 8.37; P = .007) were statistically significantly associated with development of MDS. In multivariable analyses, although advanced age (HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.19; P < .001) remained statistically associated with MDS, radiation did not, although a small non-statistically significant trend existed for PI-treated patients. MDS rates were no higher than in population-based registries.

Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia is clinically distinct from unclassifiable myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.,Blood,Blood,2014-03-13,"Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is a rare subtype of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) largely defined morphologically. It is, unclear, however, whether aCML-associated features are distinctive enough to allow its separation from unclassifiable MDS/MPN (MDS/MPN-U). To study these 2 rare entities, 134 patient archives were collected from 7 large medical centers, of which 65 (49%) cases were further classified as aCML and the remaining 69 (51%) as MDS/MPN-U. Distinctively, aCML was associated with many adverse features and an inferior overall survival (12.4 vs 21.8 months, P = .004) and AML-free survival (11.2 vs 18.9 months, P = .003). The aCML defining features of leukocytosis and circulating myeloid precursors, but not dysgranulopoiesis, were independent negative predictors. Other factors, such as lactate dehydrogenase, circulating myeloblasts, platelets, and cytogenetics could further stratify MDS/MPN-U but not aCML patient risks. aCML appeared to have more mutated RAS (7/20 [35%] vs 4/29 [14%]) and less JAK2p.V617F (3/42 [7%] vs 10/52 [19%]), but was not statistically significant. Somatic CSF3R T618I (0/54) and CALR (0/30) mutations were not detected either in aCML or MDS/MPN-U. In conclusion, within MDS/MPN, the World Health Organization 2008 criteria for aCML identify a subgroup of patients with features clearly distinct from MDS/MPN-U.

Subsequent malignant neoplasms in pediatric patients initially diagnosed with neuroblastoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2015-01-01,"Most prior studies evaluating subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in patients with neuroblastoma are restricted to long-term survivors and/or their treatment exposures. This study investigates SMNs in patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma at our institution. Records of 646 patients treated for neuroblastoma at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1961 and 2005 were reviewed. Data from patients with SMNs were analyzed and the 20- and 30-year cumulative incidence of SMNs and standardized incidence ratio were calculated. Twenty-one patients had a SMN. The 20- and 30-year cumulative incidences of a SMN were 2.6%±0.7% and 4.6%±1.1%, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio was 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 5.0-13.0). Five patients developed a SMN within 5 years from diagnosis. The median latency for the development of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=4), sarcomas (n=7), and carcinomas (n=5) were 3.6, 9, and 24.2 years, respectively.

Secondary malignant neoplasms after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue for high-risk neuroblastoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-03-14,"Outcomes for high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor. Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) have improved survival rates, but the long-term sequelae, including development of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), are just now surfacing. We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols: Chicago Pilot 1 (CP1; n = 12) and Chicago Pilot 2 (CP2; n = 75). The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-45.0%). The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5% (95%CI, 7.2-38.0%) and 34.2% (95%CI, 18.6-63.1%), respectively, without evidence of a plateau at 15 years. Six of the 10 patients (n = 2 in CP1 and n = 8 in CP2) who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Solid tumors included thyroid papillary carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and biliary adenocarcinoma. A significantly higher incidence of SMN, especially hematological malignancies, was observed in this cohort compared to older neuroblastoma studies, potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received. The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years. Although the number of the patients is relatively small, our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy.",Clinical Trial,2139.0,15.0,Outcomes high-risk neuroblastoma remain poor Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy autologous stem rescue ASCR improved survival rates long-term sequelae including development secondary malignant neoplasms SMN surfacing retrospectively reviewed 87 patients high-risk neuroblastoma treated intensive induction chemotherapy followed ASCR January 1991 July 2011 following institutional protocols Chicago Pilot 1 CP1 n 12 Chicago Pilot 2 CP2 n 75 15-year overall survival rate 87 patients 33.9 95 confidence interval CI 23.1-45.0 10- 15-year cumulative incidence SMN 16.5 95 CI 7.2-38.0 34.2 95 CI 18.6-63.1 respectively evidence plateau 15 years 10 patients n 2 CP1 n 8 CP2 developed SMN hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia AML /myelodysplastic syndrome MDS Solid included thyroid papillary carcinoma chondrosarcoma hepatocellular carcinoma biliary adenocarcinoma significantly higher incidence SMN especially hematological malignancies observed cohort compared older neuroblastoma studies potentially exposure epipodophyllotoxins high cumulative dose alkylating agents patients received risk developing SMN continued increase survival time reach plateau 15 years number patients relatively small emphasizes need life-long follow-up survivors treated modern therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"[123, 9, 64, 43, 918, 334, 2366, 24, 2189, 2600, 3933, 504, 370, 20, 3246, 2173, 56, 5, 1028, 452, 31, 4256, 10729, 47, 231, 25, 151, 84, 3, 319, 337, 4156, 141, 193, 1, 568, 393, 1179, 6474, 32, 4673, 1134, 64078, 21, 894, 446, 74, 29, 912, 7, 5, 64, 43, 54, 11, 73, 5, 1686, 504, 56, 370, 20, 10729, 59, 1024, 3372, 2, 2066, 1132, 366, 104, 1, 100, 1115, 2189, 9344, 2281, 14, 22525, 78, 133, 2, 9344, 2281, 18, 48258, 78, 481, 3, 167, 111, 63, 25, 116, 9, 62, 912, 7, 10, 466, 83, 48, 307, 268, 58, 382, 14, 512, 13, 3, 79, 2, 167, 111, 967, 287, 1, 6474, 10, 245, 33, 48, 58, 67, 18, 519, 13, 2, 562, 18, 48, 58, 203, 49, 676, 14, 106, 187, 241, 1, 8, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 437, 1, 3, 79, 7, 78, 18, 4, 22525, 2, 78, 66, 4, 48258, 54, 276, 6474, 42, 813, 441, 141, 286, 533, 329, 10589, 681, 1223, 537, 57, 159, 1796, 134, 6116, 134, 2, 2532, 449, 8, 97, 142, 287, 1, 6474, 1093, 2890, 441, 10, 164, 4, 26, 180, 72, 6, 434, 94, 751, 520, 6, 645, 6, 25999, 2, 8, 64, 967, 61, 1, 3410, 183, 46, 7, 103, 3, 43, 1, 931, 35, 6474, 1351, 6, 344, 5, 25, 98, 2, 205, 44, 3690, 3, 6133, 28, 167, 60, 242, 3, 207, 1, 3, 7, 16, 1352, 302, 114, 45, 7519, 3, 594, 9, 358, 319, 166, 126, 1, 332, 54, 11, 73, 75, 2366, 36]",1617.0,24634399,Secondary malignant neoplasms high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem rescue high-risk neuroblastoma,0,0.0

SEER-Medicare data (1999-2007) for the 4 cohorts of cancer patients. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression tested the association of the DS measure with designated cancer-directed treatments: early NSCLC (surgery), advanced NSCLC (chemotherapy), stage IV ER- breast cancer (chemotherapy), and MDS (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents). Treatment model fit was compared across model iterations. In both unadjusted and adjusted results, predicted poor DS was strongly associated with a lower likelihood of cancer treatment receipt in all 4 cohorts [early NSCLC (N=20,280), advanced NSCLC (N=31,341), stage IV ER- breast cancer (N=1519), and MDS (N=6058)] independent of other patient, contextual, and disease characteristics, as well as the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Inclusion of the DS measure into models already controlling for other variables did not significantly improve model fit across the cohorts.

Clin. Oncol.,2014-03-24,"Although azacitidine (AZA) improves survival in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, the overall response remains approximately 50%. Entinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been combined with AZA with significant clinical activity in a previous phase I dose finding study. Open label phase II randomized trial comparing AZA 50 mg/m(2)/d given for 10 days ± entinostat 4 mg/m(2)/d day 3 and day 10. All subtypes of myelodysplasia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes were eligible for the study. The primary objective was the rate of hematologic normalization (HN; complete remission + partial remission + trilineage hematological improvement). One hundred forty-nine patients were analyzed, including 97 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 52 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In the AZA group, 32% (95% CI, 22% to 44%) experienced HN and 27% (95% CI, 17% to 39%) in the AZA + entinostat group. Both arms exceeded the HN rate of historical control (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9221 trial), but only the AZA group fulfilled the primary objective of the study. Rates of overall hematologic response were 46% and 44%, respectively. Median overall survivals were 18 months for the AZA group and 13 months for the AZA + entinostat group. The combination arm led to less demethylation compared with the monotherapy arm, suggesting pharmacodynamic antagonism. Addition of entinostat to AZA did not increase clinical response as defined by the protocol and was associated with pharmacodynamic antagonism. However, the prolonged administration of AZA by itself seems to increase HN rate compared with standard dosing and warrants additional investigation.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2129.0,145.0,azacitidine AZA improves survival patients high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome overall response remains approximately 50 Entinostat histone deacetylase inhibitor combined AZA significant clinical activity previous phase dose finding Open label phase II randomized trial comparing AZA 50 mg/m 2 /d given 10 days ± entinostat 4 mg/m 2 /d day 3 day 10 subtypes myelodysplasia chronic myelomonocytic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplasia-related changes eligible primary objective rate hematologic normalization HN complete remission partial remission trilineage hematological improvement forty-nine patients including 97 patients myelodysplastic syndrome 52 patients acute myeloid leukemia AZA group 32 95 CI 22 44 experienced HN 27 95 CI 17 39 AZA entinostat group arms exceeded HN rate historical control Leukemia Group B 9221 trial AZA group fulfilled primary objective Rates overall hematologic response 46 44 respectively Median overall survivals 18 months AZA group 13 months AZA entinostat group combination arm led demethylation compared monotherapy arm suggesting pharmacodynamic antagonism Addition entinostat AZA increase clinical response defined protocol associated pharmacodynamic antagonism prolonged administration AZA increase HN rate compared standard dosing warrants additional investigation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 3752, 3924, 1804, 25, 4, 7, 5, 64, 43, 681, 3, 63, 51, 469, 705, 212, 7616, 16, 8, 1508, 2732, 230, 17, 71, 85, 397, 5, 3924, 5, 93, 38, 128, 4, 8, 698, 124, 70, 61, 1567, 45, 1020, 1756, 124, 215, 384, 160, 1430, 3924, 212, 81, 188, 18, 427, 447, 9, 79, 162, 810, 7616, 39, 81, 188, 18, 427, 218, 27, 2, 218, 79, 62, 814, 1, 6128, 442, 5451, 2, 286, 533, 5, 6128, 139, 400, 11, 625, 9, 3, 45, 3, 86, 461, 10, 3, 116, 1, 813, 5924, 9132, 236, 734, 450, 734, 21950, 2890, 767, 104, 1128, 1213, 762, 7, 11, 311, 141, 1015, 7, 5, 681, 2, 653, 7, 5, 286, 533, 4, 3, 3924, 87, 531, 48, 58, 350, 6, 584, 592, 9132, 2, 428, 48, 58, 269, 6, 587, 4, 3, 3924, 7616, 87, 110, 1335, 4726, 3, 9132, 116, 1, 2252, 182, 12, 2, 87, 132, 42926, 160, 84, 158, 3, 3924, 87, 9091, 3, 86, 461, 1, 3, 45, 151, 1, 63, 813, 51, 11, 641, 2, 584, 106, 52, 63, 3794, 11, 203, 53, 9, 3, 3924, 87, 2, 233, 53, 9, 3, 3924, 7616, 87, 3, 150, 475, 836, 6, 299, 6800, 72, 5, 3, 1411, 475, 802, 2424, 7537, 352, 1, 7616, 6, 3924, 205, 44, 344, 38, 51, 22, 395, 20, 3, 1182, 2, 10, 41, 5, 2424, 7537, 137, 3, 1069, 634, 1, 3924, 20, 4045, 2744, 6, 344, 9132, 116, 72, 5, 260, 1280, 2, 2782, 402, 940]",1623.0,24663049,Prolonged administration azacitidine entinostat myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplasia-related changes Leukemia Intergroup trial E1905,59,0.10296684118673648
STAT3 inhibitors: finding a home in lymphoma and leukemia.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2014-04-04,"The Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is an active mediator of cytokine signaling in the pathogenesis of solid and hematologic malignancies. The seven-member STAT family is composed of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation intertwined in a network with activation that ultimately leads to cell proliferation. An activated kinase enzyme phosphorylates one STAT factor or more, which shuttle to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, promoting cell survival. Somatic STAT3 mutations have been recently reported in large granular lymphocytic leukemia, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Furthermore, the relationship between BCL6 and STAT3 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, particularly on the activated B-cell subtype, needs to be further explored. The search for therapeutic STAT3 inhibitors that abrogate the JAK/STAT pathway is currently under way.

Heritable GATA2 mutations associated with familial AML-MDS: a case report and review of literature.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2014-04-22,"A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She has history of thrombocytopenia for 25 years and a significant family history of thrombocytopenia, affecting her mother, siblings and their children, as well as her own children. Both her mother and maternal aunt died from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Additional genetic analysis was performed and identified two heterozygous missence mutations in the second zinc finger domain of GATA2 gene (p.Thr358Lys, and p.Leu359Val), occurring in cis on the same allele. Given the patient's family history and clinical manifestation, this was interpreted as an acute myeloid leukemia with heritable GATA2 mutations associated with familial AML-MDS. Germline GATA2 mutations are involved in a group of complex syndromes with overlapping clinical features of immune deficiency, lymphedema and propensity to acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS). Here we reported a case of familial AML-MDS with two novel GATA2 mutations. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing the clinical features for this rare category of AML-MDS and performing the appropriate molecular testing. The diagnosis of heritable gene mutations associated familial AML-MDS has significant clinical implication for the patients and affected families. Clinical trials are available to further investigate the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in managing these patients.

Phase II clinical study of erlotinib for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2014-05-16,"Outcome in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after azanucleoside failure is poor with unmet need for active novel agents. Preclinical data have suggested that erlotinib has in vivo and in vitro off epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-target activity in MDS. We conducted a phase II study with single-agent erlotinib 150 mg/day orally in MDS patients following azanucleoside failure. All intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS patients by International Prognostic Scoring System and only those low/intermediate-1 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia or platelet counts <50 × 10(9) /L or a significant clinical hemorrhage requiring platelet transfusion or ANC <1 × 10(9) /L were eligible, with most of our patients being at high risk. In 35 eligible patients, overall best response was 14% (3 patients having marrow complete response and 2 hematological improvement). Four deaths occurred on study (sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, sudden death, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)). The most common observed grade 3/4 toxicities according to CTCAE v3 were diarrhea (17.1%), rash (17.1%), and infection (11.6%), accompanied by fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and anorexia at 5.7% each. Median overall survival was 6.8 months (95% CI 4.9-13.2), and leukemia-free survival was 5 months (95% CI 3.4-7.3). Erlotinib was generally well tolerated, with modest single-agent activity. Given these results and preclinical data suggesting synergistic effect with azanucleosides, the combination should be further explored.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2076.0,13.0,Outcome patients myelodysplastic syndrome MDS azanucleoside failure poor unmet need active novel agents Preclinical suggested erlotinib vivo vitro epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR -target activity MDS conducted phase II single-agent erlotinib 150 mg/day orally MDS patients following azanucleoside failure intermediate-2 high-risk MDS patients International Prognostic Scoring low/intermediate-1 patients transfusion-dependent anemia platelet counts 50 10 9 /L significant clinical hemorrhage requiring platelet transfusion ANC 1 10 9 /L eligible patients high risk 35 eligible patients overall best response 14 3 patients marrow complete response 2 hematological improvement deaths occurred sepsis intracranial hemorrhage sudden death acute myeloid leukemia AML common observed grade 3/4 toxicities according CTCAE v3 diarrhea 17.1 rash 17.1 infection 11.6 accompanied fatigue thrombocytopenia anorexia 5.7 Median overall survival 6.8 months 95 CI 4.9-13.2 leukemia-free survival 5 months 95 CI 3.4-7.3 Erlotinib generally tolerated modest single-agent activity Given preclinical suggesting synergistic effect azanucleosides combination explored,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[228, 4, 7, 5, 681, 1223, 50, 32002, 496, 16, 334, 5, 3715, 594, 9, 544, 229, 183, 693, 74, 47, 1148, 17, 962, 71, 4, 386, 2, 4, 439, 1889, 829, 129, 161, 153, 227, 283, 128, 4, 1223, 21, 426, 8, 124, 215, 45, 5, 226, 420, 962, 1577, 81, 218, 1428, 4, 1223, 7, 366, 32002, 496, 62, 919, 18, 15, 64, 43, 1223, 7, 20, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 2, 158, 135, 154, 919, 14, 7, 5, 2785, 470, 1545, 15, 1596, 1911, 212, 79, 83, 805, 15, 8, 93, 38, 3599, 1888, 1596, 2785, 15, 6486, 14, 79, 83, 805, 11, 625, 5, 96, 1, 114, 7, 486, 28, 64, 43, 4, 465, 625, 7, 63, 824, 51, 10, 213, 27, 7, 1041, 581, 236, 51, 2, 18, 2890, 767, 294, 1043, 489, 23, 45, 4227, 2089, 3599, 10643, 273, 2, 286, 533, 329, 3, 96, 186, 164, 88, 27, 39, 385, 768, 6, 3898, 14296, 11, 1172, 269, 14, 1641, 269, 14, 2, 930, 175, 49, 2756, 20, 613, 1340, 2, 3373, 28, 33, 67, 296, 52, 63, 25, 10, 49, 66, 53, 48, 58, 39, 83, 233, 18, 2, 2647, 115, 25, 10, 33, 53, 48, 58, 27, 39, 67, 27, 962, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 5, 1721, 226, 420, 128, 447, 46, 99, 2, 693, 74, 802, 1806, 254, 5, 40286, 3, 150, 257, 40, 195, 1443]",1434.0,24764152,Phase II clinical erlotinib treatment myelodysplastic syndromes,7,0.012216404886561954
Predictors of venous thromboembolism recurrence and bleeding among active cancer patients: a population-based cohort study.,Blood,Blood,2014-04-29,"Active cancer is the major predictor of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence, but further stratification of recurrence risk is uncertain. In a population-based cohort study of all Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with active cancer-related incident VTE during the 35-year period from 1966 to 2000 who survived 1 day or longer, we estimated VTE recurrence, bleeding on anticoagulant therapy, and survival and tested cancer and noncancer characteristics and secondary prophylaxis as predictors of VTE recurrence and bleeding, using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Of 477 patients, 139 developed recurrent VTE over the course of 1533 person-years of follow-up. The adjusted 10-year cumulative VTE recurrence rate was 28.6%. The adjusted 90-day cumulative incidence of major bleeding on anticoagulation was 1.9%. Survival was significantly worse for patients with cancer who had recurrent VTE (particularly pulmonary embolism) and with bleeding on anticoagulation. In a multivariable model, brain, lung, and ovarian cancer; myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorders; stage IV pancreatic cancer; other stage IV cancer; cancer stage progression; and leg paresis were associated with an increased hazard, and warfarin therapy was associated with a reduced hazard, of recurrent VTE.

MLL3 is a haploinsufficient 7q tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2014-05-01,"Recurring deletions of chromosome 7 and 7q [-7/del(7q)] occur in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor prognosis. However, the identity of functionally relevant tumor suppressors on 7q remains unclear. Using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 approaches, we show that an ∼50% reduction in gene dosage of the mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) gene, located on 7q36.1, cooperates with other events occurring in -7/del(7q) AMLs to promote leukemogenesis. Mll3 suppression impairs the differentiation of HSPC. Interestingly, Mll3-suppressed leukemias, like human -7/del(7q) AMLs, are refractory to conventional chemotherapy but sensitive to the BET inhibitor JQ1. Thus, our mouse model functionally validates MLL3 as a haploinsufficient 7q tumor suppressor and suggests a therapeutic option for this aggressive disease.

A prognostic model of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome for predicting survival and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2014-05-06,"We evaluated the characteristics of a cohort of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) related to therapy (t-MDS) to create a prognostic model. We identified 281 patients with MDS who had received previous chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for previous malignancy. Potential prognostic factors were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified 7 factors that independently predicted short survival in t-MDS: age ≥ 65 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2-4 (HR, 1.86), poor cytogenetics (-7 and/or complex; HR, 2.47), World Health Organization MDS subtype (RARs or RAEB-1/2; HR, 1.92), hemoglobin (< 11 g/dL; HR, 2.24), platelets (< 50 × 10(9)/dL; HR, 2.01), and transfusion dependency (HR, 1.59). These risk factors were used to create a prognostic model that segregated patients into 3 groups with distinct median overall survival: good (0-2 risk factors; 34 months), intermediate (3-4 risk factors; 12 months), and poor (5-7 risk factors; 5 months) (P < .001) and 1-year leukemia-free survival (96%, 84%, and 72%, respectively, P = .003).

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-06-02,"Reduced-intensity conditioning/nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens are increasingly used in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Reports have shown CD34(+) dose to be important for transplantation outcome using myeloablative conditioning. The role of CD34(+) dose of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) has not been previously analyzed in a large population undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning/nonmyeloablative HCT. We studied 1054 patients, ages 45 to 75 years, with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent transplantation between 2002 and 2011. Results of multivariate analysis showed that PBPC from HLA-matched siblings containing <4 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg was associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; P = .001), overall mortality (HR, 1.48; P = .008), and lower neutrophil (odds ratio [OR], .76; P = .03) and platelet (OR, .76; P = .03) recovery. PBPC from unrelated donors with CD34(+) dose < 6 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg was also associated with higher nonrelapse (HR, 1.38; P = .02) and overall mortality (HR, 1.20; P = .05). In contrast to reports after myeloablative HCT, CD34(+) dose did not affect relapse or graft-versus-host disease with either donor type. An upper cell dose limit was not associated with adverse outcomes. These data suggest that PBPC CD34(+) doses >4 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg and >6 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg are optimal for HLA-matched sibling and unrelated donor HCT, respectively.

Platelet count doubling after the first cycle of azacitidine therapy predicts eventual response and survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia but does not add to prognostic utility of the revised IPSS.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2014-07-04,"Reliable clinical or molecular predictors of benefit from azacitidine therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are not defined. Doubling of platelet count at start of second cycle of azacitidine therapy compared to baseline was associated with achieving response and survival advantage in a Dutch cohort. To validate this observation, we analysed a larger cohort of North American patients, whose data was collected in a prospective clinical trial with a longer median follow-up. We found a significant association between platelet count doubling after first cycle of azacitidine therapy and probability of achieving objective response. Among patients with MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia (<30% bone marrow blasts, n = 102), there was a statistically significant reduction in risk of death for patients who achieved platelet count doubling (n = 23, median OS, 21·0 months) compared to those who did not (n = 79, median OS, 16·7 months, adjusted hazard ratio (no/yes)=1·88, 95% confidence interval, 1·03-3·40, P = 0·04).

Genetic alterations of the cohesin complex genes in myeloid malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2014-07-08,"Somatic cohesin mutations have been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To account for the morphologic and cytogenetic diversity of these neoplasms, a well-annotated cohort of 1060 patients with myeloid malignancies including MDS (n = 386), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (n = 55), MDS/MPNs (n = 169), and AML (n = 450) were analyzed for cohesin gene mutational status, gene expression, and therapeutic and survival outcomes. Somatic cohesin defects were detected in 12% of patients with myeloid malignancies, whereas low expression of these genes was present in an additional 15% of patients. Mutations of cohesin genes were mutually exclusive and mostly resulted in predicted loss of function. Patients with low cohesin gene expression showed similar expression signatures as those with somatic cohesin mutations. Cross-sectional deep-sequencing analysis for clonal hierarchy demonstrated STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21 mutations to be ancestral in 18%, 18%, and 47% of cases, respectively, and each expanded to clonal dominance concordant with disease transformation. Cohesin mutations were significantly associated with RUNX1, Ras-family oncogenes, and BCOR and ASXL1 mutations and were most prevalent in high-risk MDS and secondary AML. Cohesin defects were associated with poor overall survival (27.2 vs 40 months; P = .023), especially in STAG2 mutant MDS patients surviving >12 months (median survival 35 vs 50 months; P = .017).

Monosomal karyotype predicts adverse prognosis in patients diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: a single-institution experience.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2014-06-10,"Cytogenetic abnormalities have a significant prognostic effect in many hematologic neoplasms. Monosomal karyotype (MK), a newly recognized cytogenetic category, has been reported to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and myelofibrosis, but its effect in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) remains relatively unknown. A retrospective study of cases diagnosed with CMML found a total of 262 patients. Patient characteristics, cytogenetic data, and survival were analyzed. Cytogenetic analysis found diploidy in 167 patients (64%). Trisomy 8 was the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality at 8% (22), followed by complex karyotype (CK) at 5% (14), (-)7 at 4% (10), and MK at 3% (7, of which 6 [86%] were also CK). Median overall survival was statistically significantly worse in MK-positive cases than in MK-negative cases (MK(+) vs. MK(-)). Patients with MK(+) only or CK(+)MK(+) did worse than any other group.

De novo acute myeloid leukemia with 20-29% blasts is less aggressive than acute myeloid leukemia with ≥30% blasts in older adults: a Bone Marrow Pathology Group study.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2014-07-31,"It is controversial whether acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with 20-29% bone marrow (BM) blasts, formerly referred to as refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBT), should be considered AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for the purposes of treatment and prognostication. We retrospectively studied 571 de novo AML in patients aged >50 years, including 142 RAEBT and 429 with ≥30% blasts (AML30), as well as 151 patients with 10-19% BM blasts (RAEB2). RAEBT patients were older and had lower white blood count, but higher hemoglobin, platelet count, and karyotype risk scores compared to AML30, while these features were similar to RAEB2. FLT3 and NPM1 mutations and monocytic morphology occurred more commonly in AML30 than in RAEBT. RAEBT patients were treated less often with induction therapy than AML30, whereas allogeneic stem cell transplant frequency was similar. The median and 4-year OS of RAEBT patients were longer than those of AML30 patients (20.5 vs 12.0 months and 28.6% vs 20.4%, respectively, P = 0.003); this difference in OS was manifested in patients in the intermediate UKMRC karyotype risk group, whereas OS of RAEBT patients and AML30 patients in the adverse karyotype risk group were not significantly different. Multivariable analysis showed that RAEBT (P < 0.0001), hemoglobin (P = 0.005), UKMRC karyotype risk group (P = 0.002), normal BM karyotype (P = 0.004), treatment with induction therapy (P < 0.0001), and stem cell transplant (P < 0.0001) were associated with longer OS.

Second solid cancers after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-07-17,"We examined risk of second solid cancers after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) using reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning (RIC/NMC). RIC/NMC recipients with leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 2833) and lymphoma (n = 1436) between 1995 and 2006 were included. In addition, RIC/NMC recipients 40 to 60 years of age (n = 2138) were compared with patients of the same age receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC, n = 6428). The cumulative incidence of solid cancers was 3.35% at 10 years. There was no increase in overall cancer risk compared with the general population (leukemia/MDS: standardized incidence ratio [SIR] .99, P = 1.00; lymphoma: SIR .92, P = .75). However, risks were significantly increased in leukemia/MDS patients for cancers of lip (SIR 14.28), tonsil (SIR 8.66), oropharynx (SIR 46.70), bone (SIR 23.53), soft tissue (SIR 12.92), and vulva (SIR 18.55) and skin melanoma (SIR 3.04). Lymphoma patients had significantly higher risks of oropharyngeal cancer (SIR 67.35) and skin melanoma (SIR 3.52). Among RIC/NMC recipients, age >50 years was the only independent risk factor for solid cancers (hazard ratio [HR] 3.02, P < .001). Among patients ages 40 to 60 years, when adjusted for other factors, there was no difference in cancer risks between RIC/NMC and MAC in leukemia/MDS patients (HR .98, P = .905).

There was no significant difference in median overall survival (OS) times between patients with therapy-related AML and those with de novo AML (8.7 months vs.10.2 months; p = 0.17). Patients with therapy-related MDS had slightly lower median baseline platelet counts and a higher frequency of poor cytogenetics than those with de novo MDS, but the two groups had similar OS times (13.6 months vs. 18.9 months; p = 0.06). Multivariate analysis revealed that cytogenetic risk, baseline white blood cell count, age and performance status were predictive for OS time in AML and that cytogenetic risk and performance status were predictive for OS time in MDS.

Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in older adults.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-08-01,"Treatment of older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is challenging because of disease morbidity and associated treatments. Both diseases represent a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders primarily affecting older adults, with treatment strategies ranging from supportive care to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Although selected older adults can benefit from intensive therapies, as a group they experience increased treatment-related morbidity, are more likely to relapse, and have decreased survival. Age-related outcome disparities are attributed to both tumor and patient characteristics, requiring an individualized approach to treatment decision making beyond consideration of chronologic age alone. Selection of therapy for any individual requires consideration of both disease-specific risk factors and estimates of treatment tolerance and life expectancy derived from evaluation of functional status and comorbidity. Although treatment options for older adults are expanding, clinical trials accounting for the heterogeneity of tumor biology and aging are needed to define standard-of-care treatments for both disease groups. In addition, trials should include outcomes addressing quality of life, maintenance of independence, and use of health care services to assist in patient-centered decision making. This review will highlight available evidence in treatment of older adults with AML or MDS and unanswered clinical questions for older adults with these diseases.",Journal Article,1999.0,52.0,Treatment older adults acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndromes MDS challenging disease morbidity associated treatments diseases represent genetically heterogeneous group disorders primarily affecting older adults treatment strategies ranging supportive care hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation selected older adults benefit intensive therapies group experience increased treatment-related morbidity likely relapse decreased survival Age-related outcome disparities attributed patient characteristics requiring individualized approach treatment decision making consideration chronologic age Selection therapy individual requires consideration disease-specific risk factors estimates treatment tolerance life expectancy derived evaluation functional status comorbidity treatment options older adults expanding clinical trials accounting heterogeneity aging needed define standard-of-care treatments disease groups addition trials include outcomes addressing quality life maintenance independence use health care services assist patient-centered decision making review highlight available evidence treatment older adults AML MDS unanswered clinical questions older adults diseases,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[24, 1, 434, 857, 5, 286, 533, 329, 15, 2040, 1223, 16, 1950, 408, 1, 34, 787, 2, 41, 640, 110, 1342, 1231, 8, 2301, 1564, 87, 1, 1997, 1561, 2319, 434, 857, 5, 24, 422, 2223, 29, 1877, 165, 6, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 242, 715, 434, 857, 122, 247, 29, 1686, 235, 22, 8, 87, 491, 730, 101, 24, 139, 787, 32, 80, 322, 6, 429, 2, 47, 340, 25, 89, 139, 228, 2227, 32, 3073, 6, 110, 30, 2, 69, 374, 1888, 35, 2596, 353, 6, 24, 948, 1079, 1654, 2415, 1, 18435, 89, 279, 881, 1, 36, 9, 500, 797, 1706, 2415, 1, 110, 34, 112, 43, 130, 2, 1423, 1, 24, 2614, 2, 358, 3399, 526, 29, 451, 1, 583, 156, 2, 1879, 242, 24, 838, 9, 434, 857, 32, 4304, 38, 143, 3116, 9, 3, 1144, 1, 30, 891, 2, 4220, 32, 575, 6, 1107, 260, 1, 165, 640, 9, 110, 34, 271, 4, 352, 143, 257, 643, 123, 3432, 372, 1, 358, 1146, 1, 5773, 2, 119, 1, 341, 165, 2142, 6, 3425, 4, 69, 4846, 948, 1079, 26, 206, 303, 1817, 390, 241, 4, 24, 1, 434, 857, 5, 329, 15, 1223, 2, 7550, 38, 1937, 9, 434, 857, 5, 46, 1342]",1490.0,25071138,Acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes older adults,148,0.2582897033158813

Randomized phase 2 study of bone-targeted therapy containing strontium-89 in advanced castrate-sensitive prostate cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-08-22,"Radiopharmaceutical use may improve the survival time of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases. Whether androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with bone-targeted therapy provides a clinical benefit to patients with advanced castrate-sensitive prostate cancer has not been investigated. Eighty male patients were enrolled, and 79 were randomized: 40 to the control arm and 39 to the strontium-89 (Sr-89) arm. After randomization, patients in both study arms received ADT, doxorubicin, and zoledronic acid. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) time. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the effects of Sr-89 after controlling for the number of bone metastases. The median follow-up time for the 29 patients alive at the last follow-up was 76.9 months (range, 0.07-103.4 months). The median PFS time was 18.5 months (95% confidence interval, 9.7-49.4 months) for the control arm and 12.9 months (95% confidence interval, 8.9-72.5 months) for the Sr-89 arm (P = .86). No patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome or a hematologic malignancy. An unplanned subgroup analysis suggested increased efficacy of bone-targeted therapy with a greater extent of bone involvement (ie, >6 bone metastases vs ≤6 bone metastases on the bone scan). The data showed that bone-targeted therapy using 1 dose of Sr-89 combined with chemohormonal ablation therapy did not favorably affect the PFS of patients with castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. The combined therapy was feasible and safe. Whether such bone-targeted therapy provides a favorable outcome for those patients with a greater tumor burden in the bone warrants further investigation.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1978.0,9.0,Radiopharmaceutical use improve survival time patients castrate-resistant prostate bone metastases androgen-deprivation therapy ADT combined bone-targeted therapy provides clinical benefit patients advanced castrate-sensitive prostate investigated Eighty male patients enrolled 79 randomized 40 control arm 39 strontium-89 Sr-89 arm randomization patients arms received ADT doxorubicin zoledronic acid Kaplan-Meier methodology evaluate progression-free survival PFS time Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression evaluate effects Sr-89 controlling number bone metastases median follow-up time 29 patients alive follow-up 76.9 months range 0.07-103.4 months median PFS time 18.5 months 95 confidence interval 9.7-49.4 months control arm 12.9 months 95 confidence interval 8.9-72.5 months Sr-89 arm P .86 patient developed myelodysplastic syndrome hematologic malignancy unplanned subgroup suggested increased efficacy bone-targeted therapy greater extent bone involvement 6 bone metastases vs ≤6 bone metastases bone scan showed bone-targeted therapy 1 dose Sr-89 combined chemohormonal ablation therapy favorably affect PFS patients castrate-sensitive prostate combined therapy feasible safe bone-targeted therapy provides favorable outcome patients greater burden bone warrants investigation,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[10522, 119, 68, 401, 3, 25, 98, 1, 7, 5, 4435, 436, 12, 2, 196, 317, 687, 1868, 36, 1360, 397, 5, 3417, 238, 36, 777, 8, 38, 247, 6, 7, 5, 131, 4435, 745, 12, 71, 44, 85, 565, 2207, 1045, 7, 11, 346, 2, 842, 11, 384, 327, 6, 3, 182, 475, 2, 587, 6, 3, 15922, 887, 7460, 887, 475, 50, 3644, 7, 4, 110, 45, 1335, 103, 1360, 856, 2, 4055, 971, 876, 882, 3209, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 91, 115, 25, 300, 98, 331, 418, 831, 1017, 320, 10, 95, 6, 376, 3, 176, 1, 7460, 887, 50, 1893, 9, 3, 207, 1, 196, 3, 52, 166, 126, 98, 9, 3, 462, 7, 1701, 28, 3, 1060, 166, 126, 10, 846, 83, 53, 184, 13, 1615, 3283, 39, 53, 3, 52, 300, 98, 10, 203, 33, 53, 48, 307, 268, 83, 67, 739, 39, 53, 9, 3, 182, 475, 2, 133, 83, 53, 48, 307, 268, 66, 83, 720, 33, 53, 9, 3, 7460, 887, 475, 19, 868, 77, 69, 276, 681, 15, 8, 813, 710, 35, 5851, 1363, 65, 1148, 101, 209, 1, 3417, 238, 36, 5, 8, 378, 1039, 1, 799, 2523, 49, 196, 105, 10020, 196, 23, 3, 1657, 3, 74, 224, 17, 3417, 238, 36, 75, 14, 61, 1, 7460, 887, 397, 5, 14220, 1650, 36, 205, 44, 5001, 1158, 3, 300, 1, 7, 5, 4435, 745, 12, 3, 397, 36, 10, 1313, 2, 1165, 317, 225, 3417, 238, 36, 777, 8, 913, 228, 9, 135, 7, 5, 8, 378, 30, 892, 4, 3, 2782, 195, 940]",1618.0,25155428,Randomized phase 2 bone-targeted therapy containing strontium-89 advanced castrate-sensitive prostate,0,0.0
Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch increases mortality after myeloablative unrelated allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2014-08-26,"We examined current outcomes of unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to determine the clinical implications of donor-recipient HLA matching. Adult and pediatric patients who had first undergone myeloablative-unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome between 1999 and 2011 were included. All had high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Of the total (n = 8003), cases were 8/8 (n = 5449), 7/8 (n = 2071), or 6/8 (n = 483) matched. HLA mismatch (6-7/8) conferred significantly increased risk for grades II to IV and III to IV acute graft vs host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall mortality compared with HLA-matched cases (8/8). Type (allele/antigen) and locus (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1) of mismatch were not associated with overall mortality. Among 8/8 matched cases, HLA-DPB1 and -DQB1 mismatch resulted in increased acute GVHD, and HLA-DPB1 mismatch had decreased relapse. Nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 allele mismatch was associated with higher TRM compared with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch or HLA-DPB1 match and increased overall mortality compared with permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatch in 8/8 (and 10/10) matched cases. Full matching at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 is required for optimal unrelated donor HCT survival, and avoidance of nonpermissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches in otherwise HLA-matched pairs is indicated.

Pharmacol.,2014-08-28,"Older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome have often been excluded from myeloablative-conditioning regimens containing busulfan because of non-disease-related morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that busulfan clearance (BuCL) in older patients (>60 years) would be reduced compared to that in younger patients, potentially explaining observed differences in busulfan tolerability. AML patients in three CALGB hematopoietic cell transplantation studies were treated with a conditioning regimen using IV busulfan, dosed at 0.8 mg/kg. Plasma busulfan concentrations were determined by LC-MS and analyzed by non-compartmental methods. BuCL was normalized to actual (ABW), ideal (IBW), or corrected (CBW) body weight (kg). Differences in BuCL between age groups were examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. One hundred and eighty-five patients were accrued; 174 provided useable pharmacokinetic data. Twenty-nine patients ≥ 60 years old (median 66; range 60-74) had a significantly higher BuCL versus those <60 years old (median 50; range 18-60): BuCL 236 versus 168 mL/min, p = 0.0002; BuCL/ABW 3.0 versus 2.1 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0001; BuCL/IBW 3.8 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0035; BuCL/CBW 3.4 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg, p = 0.0005. Inter-patient variability in clearance (CV %) was up to 48 % in both age groups. Phenytoin administration, a potential confounder, did not affect BuCL, regardless of weight normalization (p > 0.34). Contrary to our hypothesis, BuCL was significantly higher in older patients compared to younger patients in these studies and does not explain the previously reported increase in busulfan toxicity observed in older patients.",Clinical Trial,1972.0,11.0,Older patients acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome excluded myeloablative-conditioning regimens containing busulfan non-disease-related morbidity mortality hypothesized busulfan clearance BuCL older patients 60 years reduced compared younger patients potentially explaining observed differences busulfan tolerability AML patients CALGB hematopoietic transplantation studies treated conditioning regimen IV busulfan dosed 0.8 mg/kg Plasma busulfan concentrations determined LC-MS non-compartmental methods BuCL normalized actual ABW ideal IBW corrected CBW body weight Differences BuCL age groups examined Wilcoxon rank sum test eighty-five patients accrued 174 provided useable pharmacokinetic Twenty-nine patients ≥ 60 years old median 66 range 60-74 significantly higher BuCL versus 60 years old median 50 range 18-60 BuCL 236 versus 168 mL/min p 0.0002 BuCL/ABW 3.0 versus 2.1 mL/min/kg p 0.0001 BuCL/IBW 3.8 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg p 0.0035 BuCL/CBW 3.4 versus 2.6 mL/min/kg p 0.0005 Inter-patient variability clearance CV 48 age groups Phenytoin administration potential confounder affect BuCL regardless weight normalization p 0.34 Contrary hypothesis BuCL significantly higher older patients compared younger patients studies explain previously reported increase busulfan toxicity observed older patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[434, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 2, 681, 47, 629, 85, 1800, 29, 3246, 1933, 472, 1101, 3906, 408, 1, 220, 34, 139, 787, 2, 282, 21, 1237, 17, 3906, 1960, 22859, 4, 434, 7, 335, 60, 688, 40, 405, 72, 6, 17, 4, 773, 7, 751, 8290, 164, 362, 4, 3906, 1543, 329, 7, 4, 169, 4077, 1007, 31, 497, 94, 11, 73, 5, 8, 1933, 477, 75, 478, 3906, 6268, 28, 13, 66, 81, 503, 554, 3906, 1003, 11, 509, 20, 1837, 2307, 2, 311, 20, 220, 13522, 636, 22859, 10, 4207, 6, 3480, 25540, 3662, 26830, 15, 3848, 48548, 642, 924, 503, 362, 4, 22859, 59, 89, 271, 11, 409, 75, 3, 3896, 1026, 3216, 412, 104, 1128, 2, 2207, 365, 7, 11, 3198, 5811, 1052, 64813, 1456, 74, 737, 762, 7, 749, 335, 60, 1095, 52, 700, 184, 335, 794, 42, 8, 97, 142, 22859, 185, 135, 335, 60, 1095, 52, 212, 184, 203, 335, 22859, 6383, 185, 5359, 542, 1538, 19, 13, 3531, 22859, 25540, 27, 13, 185, 18, 14, 542, 1538, 503, 19, 13, 488, 22859, 26830, 27, 66, 185, 18, 49, 542, 1538, 503, 19, 13, 15569, 22859, 48548, 27, 39, 185, 18, 49, 542, 1538, 503, 19, 13, 4252, 3606, 69, 1982, 4, 1960, 6249, 10, 126, 6, 576, 4, 110, 89, 271, 14915, 634, 8, 174, 18166, 205, 44, 1158, 22859, 1583, 1, 924, 5924, 19, 13, 562, 7194, 6, 114, 1492, 22859, 10, 97, 142, 4, 434, 7, 72, 6, 773, 7, 4, 46, 94, 2, 1097, 44, 2943, 3, 373, 210, 344, 4, 3906, 155, 164, 4, 434, 7]",1597.0,25163570,Effect age pharmacokinetics busulfan patients undergoing hematopoietic transplantation alliance CALGB 10503 19808 100103,0,0.0
Favorable outcomes in elderly patients undergoing high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-08-28,"High-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) can offer potential long-term remission or cure in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Limited experience is available on the safety and efficacy of HDT-ASCT in elderly patients. This is a single-center, retrospective study examining outcomes of HDT-ASCT for 202 NHL patients, ages 60 years and older, between January 2001 and December 2012. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed according to age at HDT-ASCT, hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI), NHL histology, and remission status at the time of HDT-ASCT. The median age was 65 years (range, 60 to 74) and the majority had either diffuse large B cell lymphoma (n = 73, 37%) or mantle cell lymphoma (n = 69, 34%). One hundred and fifteen patients (57%) had high HCT-CI scores at the time of HDT-ASCT. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 to 11.9 years) for survivors, PFS and OS at 3 years were 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53% to 68%) and 73% (95% CI, 67% to 80%), respectively. Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 4% both at 100 days and at 1 year after HDT-ASCT. Age and HCT-CI score were not associated with OS or PFS, and high HCT-CI did not correlate with TRM. Seven patients (4%) developed secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia at a median of 35 months (range, 6 to 48) after HDT-ASCT.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-09-28,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has been performed primarily with an HLA-matched donor. Outcomes of haploidentical transplantation have recently improved, and a comparison between donor sources in a uniform cohort of patients has not been performed. We evaluated outcomes of 227 patients with AML/MDS treated with melphalan-based conditioning. Donors were matched related (MRD) (n = 87, 38%), matched unrelated (MUD) (n = 108, 48%), or haploidentical (n = 32, 14%). No significant differences were found between haploidentical and MUD transplantation outcomes; however, there was a trend for improved outcomes in the MRD group, with 3-year progression-free survival for patients in remission of 57%, 45%, and 41% for MRD, MUD, and haploidentical recipients, respectively (P = .417). Recovery of T cell subsets was similar for all groups. These results suggest that haploidentical donors can safely extend transplantation for AML/MDS patients without an HLA-matched donor.

Results of a prospective multicentre myeloablative double-unit cord blood transplantation trial in adult patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia.,British journal of haematology,Br. J. Haematol.,2014-10-01,"Double-unit cord blood (CB) grafts may improve engraftment and relapse risk in adults with haematological malignancies. We performed a prospective high-dose myeloablative double-unit CB transplantation (CBT) trial in adults with high-risk acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia (MDS) between 2007 and 2011. The primary aim was to establish the 1-year overall survival in a multi-centre setting. Fifty-six patients (31 acute myeloid leukaemia, 19 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 4 other acute leukaemias, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) were transplanted at 10 centres. The median infused total nucleated cell doses were 2·62 (larger unit) and 2·02 (smaller unit) x 10(7) /kg. The cumulative incidence of day 100 neutrophil engraftment was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80-96). Day 180 grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence was 64% (95%CI: 51-76) and 36% (95%CI: 24-49) of patients had chronic GVHD by 3-years. At 3-years post-transplant, the transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 39% (95%CI: 26-52), and the 3-year relapse incidence was 11% (95%CI: 4-21). With a median 37-month (range 23-71) follow-up of survivors, the 3-year disease-free survival was 50% (95%CI: 37-63). Double-unit CBT is a viable alternative therapy for high-risk acute leukaemia/ MDS in patients lacking a matched unrelated donor. This is especially important for minority patients. The relapse incidence was low but strategies to ameliorate TRM are needed.

"Second cancers in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who received frontline fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab therapy: distribution and clinical outcomes.",Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2014-11-19,"Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are known to have an increased incidence of second cancers, but the contribution of commonly used frontline therapies to the incidence of second cancers is unclear. We report on the characteristics, incidence, outcomes and factors associated with second cancers in 234 patients receiving fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) based regimens in the frontline setting. The risk of second cancers was 2.38 times higher than the expected risk in the general population. Ninety-three patients (40%) had other cancers before and 66 patients (28%) after FCR. Rates of therapy related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AML/MDS) (5.1%) and Richter transformation (RT) (9%) were high, while solid tumors were not increased.

Long-term survival and late effects among one-year survivors of second allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for relapsed acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-10-12,"We analyzed the outcomes of patients who survived disease-free for 1 year or more after a second allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for relapsed acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes between 1980 and 2009. A total of 1285 patients received a second allogeneic transplant after disease relapse; among these, 325 were relapse free at 1 year after the second HCT. The median time from first to second HCT was 17 and 24 months for children and adults, respectively. A myeloablative preparative regimen was used in the second transplantation in 62% of children and 45% of adult patients. The overall 10-year conditional survival rates after second transplantation in this cohort of patients who had survived disease-free for at least 1 year was 55% in children and 39% in adults. Relapse was the leading cause of mortality (77% and 54% of deaths in children and adults, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only disease status before second HCT was significantly associated with higher risk for overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.71 for patients with disease not in complete remission before second HCT, P < .01). Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 43% and 75% of children and adults after second transplantation. Chronic GVHD was the leading cause of nonrelapse mortality, followed by organ failure and infection. The cumulative incidence of developing at least 1 of the studied late effects within 10 years after second HCT was 63% in children and 55% in adults. The most frequent late effects in children were growth disturbance (10-year cumulative incidence, 22%) and cataracts (20%); in adults they were cataracts (20%) and avascular necrosis (13%). Among patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes who receive a second allogeneic HCT for relapse and survive disease free for at least 1 year, many can be expected to survive long term. However, they continue to be at risk for relapse and nonrelapse morbidity and mortality. Novel approaches are needed to minimize relapse risk and long-term transplantation morbidity in this population.

"Single-agent GVHD prophylaxis with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide after myeloablative, HLA-matched BMT for AML, ALL, and MDS.",Blood,Blood,2014-10-14,"High-dose, posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) reduces severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT), but the impact of PTCy on long-term, disease-specific outcomes is unclear. We conducted a retrospective study of 209 consecutive adult patients transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 138), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 28), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 43) using PTCy as sole GVHD prophylaxis after myeloablative conditioning and HLA-matched-related or -unrelated T-cell-replete allografting. At alloBMT, 30% of patients were not in morphologic complete remission. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III to IV acute GVHD at 100 days and chronic GVHD at 2 years were 45%, 11%, and 13%, respectively. Forty-three percent of patients did not require immunosuppression for any reason beyond PTCy. At 3 years, relapse cumulative incidence was 36%, disease-free survival was 46%, survival free of disease and chronic GVHD was 39%, and overall survival was 58%. Lack of remission at alloBMT, adverse cytogenetics, and low allograft nucleated cell dose were associated with inferior survival for AML patients. Minimal residual disease but not t(9;22) was associated with inferior outcomes for ALL patients.

Second cancer risk in childhood cancer survivors treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-10-18,"Treatment with radiotherapy (RT) is associated with an increased risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in childhood cancer survivors; it is unclear how treatment with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) impacts this risk. We provide the first report of SMN risk in a cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated with IMRT. Retrospective review of patients ≤21 years of age treated with IMRT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between December 1998 and February 2009. Eligible patients survived at least 5 years from IMRT initiation. The risk of SMN was assessed via standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risk (EAR). The cumulative incidence was estimated using methods for competing risks. Among 242 patients, six developed SMNs: four developed second solid cancers (all within the radiation field), and two developed myelodysplastic syndrome. Median time from IMRT initiation to a second solid cancer was 7.2 years (range, 6.8-9.5), with a 10-year cumulative incidence of 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-7.8%), SIR of 11.4 (95% CI, 3.1-29.2) and EAR of 1.8 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI, -0.1 to 3.8).

Results of phase 2 randomized study of low-dose decitabine with or without valproic acid in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-10-21,"Hypomethylating agents have demonstrated activity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Preclinical and single-arm trials have suggested that adding histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may synergize the epigenetic modulation of hypomethylating agents and improve treatment results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of adding valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, to decitabine in the treatment of MDS and AML. Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged ≥60 years were eligible. Patients were randomized in a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 6 weeks. A maximum of 150 patients were to be treated. In total, 149 patients were treated on study, including 87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML. The median patient age was 69 years (range, 20-89 years; 42% of patients were aged ≥70 years). Overall, 34% of patients achieved complete remission, and 55% had an objective response. The median survival was 11.9 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 27%. Outcome was not different with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission, overall response, or survival. Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories. Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher with the combination arm. Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML. Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents with better HDAC inhibitors and using different schedules.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1918.0,88.0,Hypomethylating agents demonstrated activity patients myelodysplastic syndrome MDS acute myeloid leukemia AML Preclinical single-arm trials suggested adding histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitors synergize epigenetic modulation hypomethylating agents improve treatment objective evaluate possible benefit adding valproic acid HDAC inhibitor decitabine treatment MDS AML Patients higher risk MDS AML aged ≥60 years eligible Patients randomized Bayesian response-adaptive design receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m 2 daily 5 days decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg daily 7 days Courses repeated 4 6 weeks maximum 150 patients treated total 149 patients treated including 87 patients MDS 62 patients AML median patient age 69 years range 20-89 years 42 patients aged ≥70 years Overall 34 patients achieved complete remission 55 objective response median survival 11.9 months estimated 2-year survival rate 27 Outcome different addition valproic acid decitabine versus decitabine relation rates complete remission overall response survival Subset demonstrate benefit MDS AML categories Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher combination arm Adding valproic acid decitabine associated improved outcome treatment patients MDS elderly patients AML Future therapies consider combining hypomethylating agents better HDAC inhibitors different schedules,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4931, 183, 47, 264, 128, 4, 7, 5, 681, 1223, 2, 286, 533, 329, 693, 2, 226, 475, 143, 47, 1148, 17, 2726, 1508, 2732, 2654, 222, 68, 8717, 3, 1418, 2356, 1, 4931, 183, 2, 401, 24, 99, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 376, 3, 899, 247, 1, 2726, 11029, 971, 35, 2654, 230, 6, 3004, 4, 3, 24, 1, 1223, 2, 329, 7, 5, 142, 43, 1223, 15, 5, 329, 1032, 6690, 60, 11, 625, 7, 11, 384, 4, 8, 5032, 51, 2454, 771, 6, 560, 1262, 3004, 179, 81, 188, 18, 391, 9, 33, 162, 15, 3004, 349, 518, 11029, 971, 212, 81, 503, 391, 9, 67, 162, 1993, 11, 2113, 454, 39, 6, 49, 244, 8, 689, 1, 1577, 7, 11, 6, 40, 73, 4, 181, 4928, 7, 11, 73, 23, 45, 141, 912, 7, 5, 1223, 2, 744, 7, 5, 329, 3, 52, 69, 89, 10, 790, 60, 184, 179, 887, 60, 595, 1, 7, 11, 1032, 6146, 60, 63, 562, 1, 7, 513, 236, 734, 2, 614, 42, 35, 461, 51, 3, 52, 25, 10, 175, 83, 53, 2, 3, 661, 18, 111, 25, 116, 10, 428, 228, 10, 44, 338, 5, 3, 352, 1, 11029, 971, 6, 3004, 185, 3004, 279, 4, 2191, 6, 3, 151, 1, 236, 734, 63, 51, 15, 25, 697, 318, 205, 44, 608, 8, 247, 262, 3, 1223, 15, 329, 1996, 385, 823, 20989, 11, 142, 5, 3, 150, 475, 2726, 11029, 971, 6, 3004, 10, 44, 41, 5, 231, 228, 4, 3, 24, 1, 7, 5, 1223, 15, 1216, 7, 5, 329, 508, 235, 68, 2419, 1525, 4931, 183, 5, 380, 2654, 222, 2, 75, 338, 2314]",1743.0,25336333,phase 2 randomized low-dose decitabine valproic acid patients myelodysplastic syndrome acute myelogenous leukemia,112,0.19546247818499127
Flow cytometry immunophenotypic findings in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and its utility in monitoring treatment response.,European journal of haematology,Eur. J. Haematol.,2015-04-17,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, characterized by persistent monocytosis. Due to the lack of unique surface markers expressed by neoplastic monocytes and the frequent CD34-negative blast immunophenotype, the diagnostic value of flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) in CMML is rarely studied. In this study, by using a multicolor FCI assay, we assessed bone marrow (BM) immunophenotypical alterations in 118 CMML patients and follow-up BM samples in 35 of these patients. The median BM monocytes as determined by FCI were 14% (1-63%), correlated with morphologic count (P = 0.0004). FCI alterations in monocytes were observed in 96% and granulocytes in 83% of cases. The percentage of CD34(+) myeloblasts by FCI was low [median 0.6% (0.02-12.6%)], but exhibiting frequent aberrancies [median 6 (2-12)]. CD34(+) B-cell precursors were absent in 93% of cases. In 35 patients with follow-up BM samples assessed, the CD34(+) myeloblasts showed persistent FCI aberrancies in all 29 patients treated with hypomethylating agents and 3 patients on observation, but became normal in 3 patients following stem cell transplant. In conclusion, CMML exhibit numerous FCI alterations in monocytes, granulocytes, and more profound/frequent in CD34(+) myeloblasts.

MLL gene amplification in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes is associated with characteristic clinicopathological findings and TP53 gene mutation.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2014-10-02,"MLL gene rearrangements are well-recognized aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In contrast, MLL gene amplification in AML/MDS remains poorly characterized. Here, we report a series of 21 patients with myeloid neoplasms associated with MLL gene amplification from 1 institution. This series included 13 men and 8 women, with a median age of 64 years. Eleven patients presented as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, 6 as therapy-related AML, and 4 as therapy-related MDS. All patients had a highly complex karyotype, including frequent -5/del(5q), -18, and -17/del(17p) abnormalities; 16 patients were hypodiploid. TP53 mutations were detected in all 12 patients tested, and 3 patients showed TP53 mutation before MLL amplification. Morphologically, the leukemic cells frequently showed cytoplasmic vacuoles, bilobed nuclei, and were associated with background dyspoiesis. Immunophenotypically, 15 patients had a myeloid and 4 had myelomonocytic immunophenotype. Laboratory coagulopathies were common; 7 patients developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and 3 died of intracranial bleeding. All patients were refractory to therapy; the median overall survival was 1 month, after MLL gene amplification was detected. We concluded that AML/MDS with MLL gene amplification is likely a subset of therapy-related AML/MDS or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, associated with distinct clinicopathological features, frequent disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, a highly complex karyotype, TP53 deletion/mutation, and an aggressive clinical course.

A close association of autoimmune-mediated processes and autoimmune disorders with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: observation from a single institution.,Acta haematologica,Acta Haematol.,2014-11-20,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disease, may be linked to immune-mediated processes and/or autoimmune disorders (AID), although the exact pathogens are still elusive. We retrospectively analyzed 123 CMML patients in our institution. Twenty-four CMML patients (19.5%) had at least one immune-mediated disorder, most commonly idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, gout and psoriasis. Four of these 24 patients (15%) had more than one AID. We found that, in contrast to the general population with a prevalence rate of 3.2-5.2%, newly diagnosed CMML patients demonstrated a high prevalence and variety of immune-mediated processes and/or AID. When we compared the results with those of myelodysplastic syndromes published in the literature, the prevalence of AID in these two groups of patients is similar. Our results also showed that the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities was less in CMML patients with AID (6 of 21; 28.6%) than in those without AID (37 of 94; 39.4%), although there was no statistical significance (p = 0.334).

Increasing incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease in allogeneic transplantation: a report from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2014-10-30,"Although transplant practices have changed over the last decades, no information is available on trends in incidence and outcome of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) over time. This study used the central database of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) to describe time trends for cGVHD incidence, nonrelapse mortality, and risk factors for cGVHD. The 12-year period was divided into 3 intervals, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2003, and 2004 to 2007, and included 26,563 patients with acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed an increased incidence of cGVHD in more recent years (odds ratio = 1.19, P < .0001), and this trend was still seen when adjusting for donor type, graft type, or conditioning intensity. In patients with cGVHD, nonrelapse mortality has decreased over time, but at 5 years there were no significant differences among different time periods. Risk factors for cGVHD were in line with previous studies.

Fourteen patients were enrolled in the phase I and 40 in the phase II. Overall response rate was 26%. The median remission duration (RD) was 20 weeks and was significantly longer in patients with FLT3 mutations not previously exposed to other FLT3 inhibitors (P = 0.05) and in patients not previously transplanted (P = 0.01). Thirty-two (59%) patients have died, all of complications related to disease progression. G3-4 nonhematological toxicity was reported in 38 (70%) patients, most frequently infections (56%), ejection fraction reduction (11%), and diarrhea or nausea/vomiting (9% each). The combination of midostaurin and AZA is an effective and safe regimen in patients with AML and high-risk MDS. Patients with FLT3 mutations but not previously exposed to other FLT3 inhibitors and patients not previously transplanted derived the greatest benefit.

Risk of marrow neoplasms after adjuvant breast cancer therapy: the national comprehensive cancer network experience.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-12-22,"Outcomes for early-stage breast cancer have improved. First-generation adjuvant chemotherapy trials reported a 0.27% 8-year cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia. Incomplete ascertainment and follow-up may have underestimated subsequent risk of treatment-associated marrow neoplasm (MN). We examined the MN frequency in 20,063 patients with stage I to III breast cancer treated at US academic centers between 1998 and 2007. Time-to-event analyses were censored at first date of new cancer event, last contact date, or death and considered competing risks. Cumulative incidence, hazard ratios (HRs), and comparisons with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results estimates were obtained. Marrow cytogenetics data were reviewed. Fifty patients developed MN (myeloid, n = 42; lymphoid, n = 8) after breast cancer (median follow-up, 5.1 years). Patients who developed MN had similar breast cancer stage distribution, race, and chemotherapy exposure but were older compared with patients who did not develop MN (median age, 59.1 v 53.9 years, respectively; P = .03). Two thirds of patients had complex MN cytogenetics. Risk of MN was significantly increased after surgery plus chemotherapy (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 36.1) or after all modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation; HR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 35.8), compared with no treatment with chemotherapy. MN rates per 1,000 person-years were 0.16 (surgery), 0.43 (plus radiation), 0.46 (plus chemotherapy), and 0.54 (all three modalities).

Bone marrow or peripheral blood for reduced-intensity conditioning unrelated donor transplantation.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-12-22,"There have been no randomized trials that have compared peripheral blood (PB) with bone marrow (BM) grafts in the setting of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantations for hematologic malignancy. Because immune modulation plays a significant role in sustaining clinical remission after RIC, we hypothesize that higher graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with PB transplantation may offer a survival advantage. The primary outcome evaluated was overall survival. Cox regression models were built to study outcomes after transplantation of PB (n = 887) relative to BM (n = 219) for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the three most common indications for unrelated RIC transplantation. Transplantations were performed in the United States between 2000 and 2008. Conditioning regimens consisted of an alkylating agent and fludarabine, and GVHD prophylaxis involved a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with either methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). After adjusting for age, performance score, donor-recipient HLA-match, disease, and disease status at transplantation (factors associated with overall survival), there were no significant differences in 5-year rates of survival after transplantation of PB compared with BM: 34% versus 38% with CNI-MTX and 27% versus 20% with CNI-MMF GVHD prophylaxis. Survival after transplantation of PB and BM are comparable in the setting of nonirradiation RIC regimens for hematologic malignancy.

"G-CSF priming, clofarabine, and high dose cytarabine (GCLAC) for upfront treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-01-30,"Prior study of the combination of clofarabine and high dose cytarabine with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) priming (GCLAC) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia resulted in a 46% rate of complete remission despite unfavorable risk cytogenetics. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the remission rate and survival with GCLAC were superior to FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF) in the relapsed setting. We therefore initiated a study of the GCLAC regimen in the upfront setting in a multicenter trial. The objectives were to evaluate the rates of complete remission (CR), overall and relapse-free survival (OS and RFS), and toxicity of GCLAC. Clofarabine was administered at 30 mg m(-2) day(-1) × 5 and cytarabine at 2 g m(-2) day(-1) × 5 after G-CSF priming in 50 newly-diagnosed patients ages 18-64 with AML or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Responses were assessed in the different cytogenetic risk groups and in patients with antecedent hematologic disorder. The overall CR rate was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64-88%) and the CR + CRp (CR with incomplete platelet count recovery) was 82% (95% CI 71-93%). The CR rate was 100% for patients with favorable, 84% for those with intermediate, and 62% for those with unfavorable risk cytogenetics. For patients with an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), the CR rate was 65%, compared to 85% for those without an AHD. The 60 day mortality was 2%.

Low efficacy and high mortality associated with clofarabine treatment of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2014-12-12,"Clofarabine, a second-generation nucleoside analog, has clinical activity in relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, there are few data evaluating performance of clofarabine in populations of patients not enrolled in clinical trials. We reviewed outcomes for 84 patients treated with clofarabine for relapsed or refractory AML or MDS, either with clofarabine as monotherapy (n=19) or in combination with cytarabine (n=65). Using International Working Group (IWG) response criteria, the overall response rate (ORR) of all treated patients was 21%, with a complete response rate with either complete or incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRR=CR+CRi) of 14%. For combination therapy, ORR was 22% with CRR of 18%, and monotherapy patients had an ORR of 21% with CRR of 11%. Although limited by small numbers, subgroup analysis did not reveal variation in response rates when comparing different risk factors.

"Mutational profiling of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia by next generation sequencing, a comparison with de novo diseases.",Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2014-12-20,"In this study we used a next generation sequencing-based approach to profile gene mutations in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML); and compared these findings with de novo MDS/AML. Consecutive bone marrow samples of 498 patients, including 70 therapy-related (28 MDS and 42 AML) and 428 de novo (147 MDS and 281 AML) were analyzed using a modified-TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (Illumina) covering mutation hotspots of 53 genes. Overall, mutation(s) were detected in 58.6% of t-MDS/AML and 56.8% of de novo MDS/AML. Of therapy-related cases, mutations were detected in 71.4% of t-AML versus 39.3% t-MDS (p=0.0127). TP53 was the most common mutated gene in t-MDS (35.7%) as well as t-AML (33.3%), significantly higher than de novo MDS (17.7%) (p=0.0410) and de novo AML (12.8%) (p=0.0020). t-AML showed more frequent PTPN11 but less NPM1 and FLT3 mutations than de novo AML. In summary, t-MDS/AML shows a mutation profile different from their de novo counterparts.

Cutting the cord from myelodysplastic syndromes: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-specific biology and management strategies.,Current opinion in hematology,Curr. Opin. Hematol.,2015-03-01,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a troublesome hematologic malignancy characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis, marrow dysplasia, cytopenias, frequent extramedullary involvement by clonal cells, and a propensity for progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Although previously considered a subtype of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), CMML is now recognized as a distinct entity with unique biologic and clinical features. This change has created a scientific and clinical research landscape that makes it difficult to discern CMML-specific validated conclusions versus speculative extrapolation from more general MDS data. Here, we review recent biologic observations that support the current CMML WHO classification, such as the high frequency of SRSF2 and ASXL1 mutations compared with MDS and critical dependence of CMML cells on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling. In addition, we discuss CMML-specific prognostic tools and therapeutic results of agents developed for MDS in patients with CMML.

An international consortium proposal of uniform response criteria for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) in adults.,Blood,Blood,2015-01-26,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are hematologically diverse stem cell malignancies sharing phenotypic features of both myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. There are currently no standard treatment recommendations for most adult patients with MDS/MPN. To optimize efforts to improve the management and disease outcomes, it is essential to identify meaningful clinical and biologic end points and standardized response criteria for clinical trials. The dual dysplastic and proliferative features in these stem cell malignancies define their uniqueness and challenges. We propose response assessment guidelines to harmonize future clinical trials with the principal objective of establishing suitable treatment algorithms. An international panel comprising laboratory and clinical experts in MDS/MPN was established involving 3 independent academic MDS/MPN workshops (March 2013, December 2013, and June 2014).

More is better: combination therapies for myelodysplastic syndromes.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2014-11-11,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogenous collection of clonal hematopoietic malignancies that exist as a subgroup of the myeloid neoplasms as classified by the World Health Organization (WHO). They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, subsequent cytopenias, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and poor overall survival. There are currently three FDA-approved medications for MDS; lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine. The role of these agents is to diminish the clinical impact of MDS and delay its progression to AML. However, despite known results with these monotherapies, recent clinical trials with a variety of combinations for MDS have demonstrated promising results. These trials include combinations of hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, growth factors, and chemotherapy among others. In this paper we review the current literature on combination therapies in MDS, analyze on-going and concluded trials, and suggest future possibilities for combination strategies in MDS.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-02-07,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (CY) after ablative HLA-matched bone marrow (BM) transplantation has been reported to have comparable rates of acute GVHD with an apparent reduction in chronic GVHD and infections when compared to historical prophylaxis with a calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX). We conducted a phase II trial of post-transplantation CY (post-CY) after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) using intravenous busulfan (area under the curve of 4000 micromolar minute), fludarabine (40 mg/m(2)) for 4 days, and CY 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4 after BM or peripheral blood (PB) transplantations from matched related (MRD) or unrelated donors (MUD). MUD recipients received antithymocyte globulin (ATG); however, a later amendment removed ATG. Forty-nine patients were treated (acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 82%). Median age was 62 years (range, 39 to 72). Fifteen patients received an MRD (9 PB/6 BM); 34 had a MUD (2 PB/32 BM). The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD, III to IV acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD was 58%, 22%, and 18%, respectively. A matched cohort analysis compared outcomes to tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis and indicated higher rates of acute GVHD grade II to IV (46% versus 19%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.8; P = .02) and treatment-related mortality (HR, 3.3; P = .035) and worse overall survival (HR, 1.9; P = .04) with post-CY. The incidence of chronic GVHD and CMV reactivation did not differ.

Phase III open-label randomized study of cytarabine in combination with amonafide L-malate or daunorubicin as induction therapy for patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2015-03-02,"Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), defined as AML arising after a prior myelodysplastic syndrome or after antineoplastic therapy, responds poorly to current therapies. It is often associated with adverse karyotypic abnormalities and overexpression of proteins that mediate drug resistance. We performed a phase III trial to determine whether induction therapy with cytarabine and amonafide L-malate, a DNA intercalator and non-ATP-dependent topoisomerase II inhibitor that evades drug resistance mechanisms, yielded a superior complete remission rate than standard therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin in sAML. Patients with previously untreated sAML were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to cytarabine 200 mg/m(2) continuous intravenous (IV) infusion once per day on days 1 to 7 plus either amonafide 600 mg/m(2) IV over 4 hours on days 1 to 5 (A + C arm) or daunorubicin 45 mg/m(2) IV over 30 minutes once per day on days 1 to 3 (D + C arm).

J. Haematol.,2015-03-02,"This trial was conducted to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the first in class NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, pevonedistat, and to investigate pevonedistat pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Pevonedistat was administered via a 60-min intravenous infusion on days 1, 3 and 5 (schedule A, n = 27), or days 1, 4, 8 and 11 (schedule B, n = 26) every 21-days. Dose escalation proceeded using a standard '3 + 3' design. Responses were assessed according to published guidelines. The MTD for schedules A and B were 59 and 83 mg/m(2) , respectively. On schedule A, hepatotoxicity was dose limiting. Multi-organ failure (MOF) was dose limiting on schedule B. The overall complete (CR) and partial (PR) response rate in patients treated at or below the MTD was 17% (4/23, 2 CRs, 2 PRs) for schedule A and 10% (2/19, 2 PRs) for schedule B. Pevonedistat plasma concentrations peaked after infusion followed by elimination in a biphasic pattern. Pharmacodynamic studies of biological correlates of NAE inhibition demonstrated target-specific activity of pevonedistat. In conclusion, administration of the first-in-class agent, pevonedistat, was feasible in patients with MDS and AML and modest clinical activity was observed.

"Phase I study of S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (salirasib), a novel oral RAS inhibitor in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies.","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2015-02-19,"Rat sarcoma (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (mutational or nonmutational) is a key pathway for survival and proliferative advantage of leukemic cells. Salirasib (Concordia Pharmaceuticals) is an oral RAS inhibitor that causes dislocation of RAS by competing directly with farnesylated RAS in binding to its putative membrane-binding proteins. Salirasib does not inhibit farnesyl transferase enzyme. We report on a phase I study of Salirasib in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Salirasib was administered orally twice daily on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle in a ""3+3"" dose escalation design. Seventeen patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia were treated for a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-29). Three patients each were enrolled at a dose level of 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg twice daily and 2 patients at a dose level of 900 mg twice daily. No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered. Grade 1/2 diarrhea was the only frequent nonhematologic toxicity observed in 14 of 17 (82%) patients and was resolved with oral antidiarrheal agents. Eight (47%) patients (4 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 with acute myeloid leukemia, 1 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 with chronic myeloid leukemia) had hematological improvement; 1 in 3 lineages, 1 in 2 lineages, and 6 in 1 lineage. None of the patients achieved complete remission. The responses lasted for a median of 10 weeks (range, 5-115). The study was discontinued because of financial constraints. Salirasib was well tolerated and showed modest activity in relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies. The safety profile of Salirasib and its hematological malignancy relevant target makes it a potential drug to be used in combination therapy.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1797.0,16.0,Rat sarcoma RAS /rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma RAF /mitogen-activated kinase activation nonmutational key pathway survival proliferative advantage leukemic Salirasib Concordia Pharmaceuticals oral RAS inhibitor causes dislocation RAS competing directly farnesylated RAS binding putative membrane-binding Salirasib inhibit farnesyl transferase enzyme report phase Salirasib patients relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies Salirasib administered orally twice daily days 1 21 28-day cycle `` 3+3 '' dose escalation design Seventeen patients relapsed/refractory leukemia treated median 4 cycles range 1-29 patients enrolled dose level 100 200 400 600 800 mg twice daily 2 patients dose level 900 mg twice daily dose-limiting toxicities encountered Grade 1/2 diarrhea frequent nonhematologic toxicity observed 14 17 82 patients resolved oral antidiarrheal agents 47 patients 4 myelodysplastic syndrome 2 acute myeloid leukemia 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 1 chronic myeloid leukemia hematological improvement 1 3 lineages 1 2 lineages 6 1 lineage patients achieved complete remission responses lasted median 10 weeks range 5-115 discontinued financial constraints Salirasib tolerated showed modest activity relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies safety profile Salirasib hematological malignancy relevant target makes potential drug combination therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4008, 1102, 1755, 2241, 8378, 2212, 2625, 735, 178, 216, 363, 1619, 15, 37067, 16, 8, 825, 308, 9, 25, 2, 2441, 1874, 1, 2015, 37, 12668, 65797, 5888, 16, 35, 518, 1102, 230, 17, 1626, 48920, 1, 1102, 20, 2573, 1606, 5, 28870, 1102, 4, 791, 6, 211, 2743, 1905, 791, 652, 12668, 1097, 44, 1433, 8846, 4402, 1644, 21, 414, 23, 8, 124, 70, 45, 1, 12668, 4, 7, 5, 591, 430, 813, 441, 12668, 10, 468, 1428, 936, 391, 23, 162, 14, 6, 239, 1, 8, 339, 218, 417, 4, 8, 27, 27, 522, 61, 1125, 771, 3591, 7, 5, 591, 430, 11, 73, 9, 8, 52, 1, 39, 410, 184, 14, 462, 169, 7, 296, 11, 346, 28, 8, 61, 301, 1, 394, 1250, 1524, 2383, 2, 2796, 81, 936, 391, 2, 18, 7, 28, 8, 61, 301, 1, 5310, 81, 936, 391, 77, 61, 817, 385, 11, 3903, 88, 14, 18, 1172, 10, 3, 158, 908, 3534, 155, 164, 4, 213, 1, 269, 878, 7, 2, 10, 3862, 5, 518, 26911, 183, 659, 662, 7, 39, 5, 681, 18, 5, 286, 533, 14, 5, 442, 5451, 2, 14, 5, 442, 533, 42, 2890, 767, 14, 4, 27, 7234, 14, 4, 18, 7234, 2, 49, 4, 14, 2542, 1292, 1, 3, 7, 513, 236, 734, 3, 253, 6854, 9, 8, 52, 1, 79, 244, 184, 33, 3670, 3, 45, 10, 2402, 408, 1, 3021, 4879, 12668, 10, 149, 421, 2, 224, 1721, 128, 4, 591, 430, 2890, 441, 3, 367, 800, 1, 12668, 2, 211, 2890, 710, 867, 283, 4677, 192, 8, 174, 234, 6, 40, 95, 4, 150, 36]",1696.0,25795639,Phase S-trans trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid salirasib novel oral RAS inhibitor patients refractory hematologic malignancies,93,0.16230366492146597
WT1 vaccination in AML and MDS: A pilot trial with synthetic analog peptides.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-05-03,"Peptide vaccines are capable of eliciting immune responses targeting tumor-associated antigens such as the Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, often overexpressed in myeloid malignancies. Here, we assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a polyvalent WT1 peptide vaccine. Individuals with WT1-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first (CR1) or second (CR2) remission or with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following at least 1 prior line of therapy were vaccinated with a mixture of peptides derived from the WT1 protein, with sargramostim injections before vaccination to amplify immunogenicity. Six vaccinations were delivered biweekly, continuing then monthly until patients received 12 vaccinations or showed disease relapse or progression. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by progression-free and overall survival. Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity testing and T-cell IFNγ ELISPOT at specified intervals. In 16 patients who received at least one vaccination, 10 completed the planned course of six vaccinations and six continued for up to six additional monthly vaccinations. Vaccinations were well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing due to toxicity. One of two patients with high-risk MDS experienced a prolonged decrease in transfusion dependence.

IL8-CXCR2 pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategy against MDS and AML stem cells.,Blood,Blood,2015-03-25,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are associated with disease-initiating stem cells that are not eliminated by conventional therapies. Novel therapeutic targets against preleukemic stem cells need to be identified for potentially curative strategies. We conducted parallel transcriptional analysis of highly fractionated stem and progenitor populations in MDS, AML, and control samples and found interleukin 8 (IL8) to be consistently overexpressed in patient samples. The receptor for IL8, CXCR2, was also significantly increased in MDS CD34(+) cells from a large clinical cohort and was predictive of increased transfusion dependence. High CXCR2 expression was also an adverse prognostic factor in The Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort, further pointing to the critical role of the IL8-CXCR2 axis in AML/MDS. Functionally, CXCR2 inhibition by knockdown and pharmacologic approaches led to a significant reduction in proliferation in several leukemic cell lines and primary MDS/AML samples via induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Importantly, inhibition of CXCR2 selectively inhibited immature hematopoietic stem cells from MDS/AML samples without an effect on healthy controls. CXCR2 knockdown also impaired leukemic growth in vivo. Together, these studies demonstrate that the IL8 receptor CXCR2 is an adverse prognostic factor in MDS/AML and is a potential therapeutic target against immature leukemic stem cell-enriched cell fractions in MDS and AML.

Discontinuation of hypomethylating agent therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myelogenous leukemia in complete remission or partial response: retrospective analysis of survival after long-term follow-up.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2015-03-20,"Hypomethylating agents (HMA), such as 5-azacitidine or decitabine, are currently used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) until treatment failure. However, the outcomes for patients who discontinue therapy after achieving partial response (PR) or complete remission (CR) but before treatment failure have not been reported. We present a series of 16 patients with higher-risk MDS (n=5; 31%) or AML (n=11; 69%) who achieved PR (n=1) or CR (n=15) and stopped HMA therapy while in response in the context of clinical trials. They received a median of 12 courses (range 1-24) and achieved response after a median of 1 course of therapy (1-4). Loss of response after discontinuation of therapy was rapid, with a median progression-free survival of 4 months (95% CI: 2-6). Median overall survival (OS) from the time of therapy discontinuation was 15 months (95% CI: 6-24). Patients who received 12 cycles of therapy or more had significantly better OS (median: 20 months [95% CI: 12-27]) than those who received fewer than 12 cycles (median: 4 months [95% CI: 1-8]) (p=0.043). Poor-risk cytogenetics were also associated with lower 1-year OS (33% versus 69%; p=0.046). According to these results and considering the poor prognosis after HMA failure, HMA interruption should be avoided once a sustained response has been achieved.

The ever-evolving landscape of candidaemia in patients with acute leukaemia: non-susceptibility to caspofungin and multidrug resistance are associated with increased mortality.,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,J. Antimicrob. Chemother.,2015-04-07,"The epidemiology and clinical course of candidaemia in patients with acute leukaemia, a population frequently exposed to antifungals, have not been extensively studied. In the present contemporary series of acute leukaemia patients, we describe patient characteristics, Candida species and MIC distributions and investigate the association between antifungal resistance and all-cause mortality. We performed a retrospective review of medical records and microbiological data of adult patients with acute leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with at least one positive blood culture for Candida species at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2008 and October 2012. Susceptibility was defined according to the 2012 epidemiological cut-off values and clinical breakpoints. We identified 67 episodes of candidaemia in 65 patients. Almost all episodes (94%) occurred in patients who were receiving antifungal agents, 71% in patients receiving an echinocandin. Almost all isolates (99%) were of non-albicans Candida species [most frequently Candida parapsilosis (32%), Candida tropicalis (23%) and Candida glabrata (20%)]. Caspofungin non-susceptibility was significantly associated with fluconazole resistance (P < 0.001).

Leukemia cell mobilization with G-CSF plus plerixafor during busulfan-fludarabine conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,Bone marrow transplantation,Bone Marrow Transplant.,2015-04-13,"We hypothesized that during conditioning chemotherapy for allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), the disruption of stromal-leukemia interactions using G-CSF in combination with the CXCR4-specific inhibitor, plerixafor, may promote the release of leukemic cells from the niche and increase tumor elimination. In a phase 1/2 investigation, we treated 45 AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/CML patients (34 AML, 7 MDS and 4 CML) with G-CSF (10 μg/kg daily for 6 days starting on day -9) plus plerixafor (doses of 0, 80, 160 or 240 μg/kg daily for 4 days starting on day -7) along with the busulfan-fludarabine (Bu-Flu) conditioning regimen. In the phase 1 part, we determined that G-CSF plus plerixafor is safe in this setting.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and its distinction from myelodysplastic syndromes.,Blood,Blood,2015-04-30,"Recent genetic analyses of large populations have revealed that somatic mutations in hematopoietic cells leading to clonal expansion are commonly acquired during human aging. Clonally restricted hematopoiesis is associated with an increased risk of subsequent diagnosis of myeloid or lymphoid neoplasia and increased all-cause mortality. Although myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by cytopenias, dysplastic morphology of blood and marrow cells, and clonal hematopoiesis, most individuals who acquire clonal hematopoiesis during aging will never develop MDS. Therefore, acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenias and dysplastic hematopoiesis can be considered clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), analogous to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, which are precursor states for hematologic neoplasms but are usually benign and do not progress. Because mutations are frequently observed in healthy older persons, detection of an MDS-associated somatic mutation in a cytopenic patient without other evidence of MDS may cause diagnostic uncertainty. Here we discuss the nature and prevalence of CHIP, distinction of this state from MDS, and current areas of uncertainty regarding diagnostic criteria for myeloid malignancies.

"Phase 1 dose escalation trial of ilorasertib, a dual Aurora/VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor, in patients with hematologic malignancies.",Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2015-05-02,"Ilorasertib (ABT-348) is a novel inhibitor of Aurora kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and the Src families of tyrosine kinases. Ilorasertib alone or in combination with azacitidine demonstrated activity in preclinical models in various hematological malignancies, indicating that pan-Aurora kinase and multiple kinase inhibition may have preferential antileukemic activity. This phase 1 trial determined the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of ilorasertib alone or combined with azacitidine in advanced hematologic malignancies. Fifty-two patients (median age, 67 years; 35 % with >4 prior regimens) with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML; n = 38), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 2) received 3 or 6 doses of ilorasertib per 28-day cycle and were assigned to arm A (once-weekly oral), B (twice-weekly oral), C (once-weekly oral plus azacitidine), or D (once-weekly intravenous) treatment. Maximum tolerated doses were not determined; the recommended phase 2 oral monotherapy doses were 540 mg once weekly and 480 mg twice weekly. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were hypertension (28.8 %), hypokalemia (15.4 %), anemia (13.5 %), and hypophosphatemia (11.5 %). Oral ilorasertib pharmacokinetics appeared dose proportional, with a 15-hour half-life and no interaction with azacitidine. Ilorasertib inhibited biomarkers for Aurora kinase and VEGF receptors, and demonstrated clinical responses in 3 AML patients.

TP53 mutation characteristics in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia is similar to de novo diseases.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2015-05-08,"TP53 mutation is more prevalent in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) than their de novo counterparts; however, the pattern of mutations involving TP53 gene in t-MN versus de novo diseases is largely unknown. We collected 108 consecutive patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). Clinical, hematological, and cytogenetic data were collected by searching the electronic medical record. TP53 sequencing was performed in all patients using a clinically validated next-generation sequencing-based gene panel assay. A previously published patient cohort consisting of 428 patients with de novo MDS/AML was included for comparison. We assessed 108 patients with t-MN, in which 40 patients (37%) had TP53 mutations. The mutation frequency was similar between t-MDS and t-AML; but significantly higher than de novo MDS/AML (62/428 patients, 14.5%) (p<0.0001). TP53 mutations in t-MN were mainly clustered in DNA-binding domains, with an allelic frequency of 37.0% (range, 7.1 to 98.8). Most mutations involved single nucleotide changes, of which, transitions (65.9%) were more common than transversions (34.1%). Missense mutations were the most frequent, followed by frameshift and nonsense mutations. This TP53 mutation pattern was strikingly similar to that observed in de novo MDS/AML. TP53 mutations in t-MN were associated with a complex karyotype (p<0.0001), a higher number of chromosomal abnormalities (p<0.0001), and an inferior overall survival in affected patients (6.1 vs 14.1 months) by univariate (p<0.0001) and multivariate analyses (p=0.0020).

Impact of KIR and HLA Genotypes on Outcomes after Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-05-08,"Natural killer cells are regulated by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) interactions with HLA class I ligands. Several models of natural killer cell reactivity have been associated with improved outcomes after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but this issue has not been rigorously addressed in reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) unrelated donor (URD) HCT. We studied 909 patients undergoing RIC-URD HCT.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-05-29,"Clinical trials commonly use adjudication committees to refine endpoints, but observational research or genome-wide association studies rarely do. Our goals were to establish definitions of cause-specific death after unrelated-donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (URD-HCT), to estimate discordance between reported and adjudicated cause-specific death, and to identify factors contributing to inconsistency in cause-specific death determination. A consensus panel adjudicated cause-specific death in 1484 patients who died within 1 year after HCT, derived from 3532 acute leukemia or myelodysplasia patients after URD-HCT from 2000 to 2011 reported by 151 US transplant centers to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Deaths were classified as disease-related or transplant-related. The panel agreed with >99% of deaths reported by centers as disease-related and 80% reported as transplant-related. Year of transplant (cohort effect) and disease status significantly influenced agreement between the panel and centers. Sensitivity analysis of deaths < 100 days post-transplant yielded the lowest agreement between the panel and centers for myelodysplastic syndrome patients. Standard predefined criteria for adjudicating cause-specific death led to consistent application to similar clinical scenarios and clearer delineation of cause-specific death categories. Other studies of competing events such as cancer-specific versus treatment-related mortality would benefit from our results.

We searched our cytogenetic database from 2003 to 2014 to identify cases of myeloid malignancies associated with a JT. These cases were cross-referenced with our clinical databases to determine patient characteristics, response to treatment and overall survival. We identified 10 patients with myeloid malignancies and a JT: 4 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes, 4 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 cases of postpolycythemia myelofibrosis. The donor segment was derived from chromosome 1 in every case. The acquisition of a JT was a late occurrence, with a median time to JT development of 24.9 months (range, 0-248 months) from diagnosis. The overall response to treatment was poor, with no patients experiencing a response to conventional chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents. The median overall survival for the group was 9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-15.5) after identification of a JT.

Mixed T Lymphocyte Chimerism after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation Is Predictive for Relapse of Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-07-14,"Chimerism testing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represents a promising tool for predicting disease relapse, although its precise role in this setting remains unclear. We investigated the predictive value of T lymphocyte chimerism analysis at 90 to 120 days after allo-HSCT in 378 patients with AML/MDS who underwent busulfan/fludarabine-based myeloablative preparative regimens. Of 265 (70%) patients with available T lymphocyte chimerism data, 43% of patients in first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2) at the time of transplantation had complete (100%) donor T lymphocytes at day +90 to +120 compared with 60% of patients in the non-CR1/CR2 cohort (P = .005). In CR1/CR2 patients, donor T lymphocyte chimerism ≤ 85% at day +90 to +120 was associated with a higher frequency of 3-year disease progression (29%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 46% versus 15%; 95% CI, 9% to 23%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.1; P = .04).

"Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and multiple-dose rituximab as frontline therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Cancer,Cancer,2015-07-28,"Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) result in durable responses in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous reports have suggested that in patients with relapsed CLL, a dose-intensified rituximab regimen increases response rates in comparison with standard-dose rituximab. It is unknown whether rituximab intensification of the FCR regimen will result in improved response rates and patient outcomes in patients with previously untreated CLL. A single-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified FCR regimen with multiple-dose rituximab (FCR3) in 65 patients with previously untreated CLL. The results were compared with those for a historical cohort treated with FCR. The overall response rate to FCR3 was 97%, with 75% of the patients achieving a complete remission. Minimal residual disease negativity was achieved for 62% of the patients according to flow cytometry. The median time to progression (TTP) was 81 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached, with 58% of the patients still alive at a median survivor follow-up of 9.7 years. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and major infections were observed with 45%, 5%, and 1.9% of the FCR3 courses, respectively. Therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML) developed in 7 patients (11%; P < .01 vs the historical FCR cohort). In patients with previously untreated CLL, FCR3 resulted in response rates, TTP, and OS similar to those of a historical cohort of patients treated with FCR.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-08-07,"Clofarabine has potent antileukemia activity and its inclusion in reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute leukemia could potentially improve outcomes. We conducted a phase II study of busulfan (.8 mg/kg i.v. twice daily on days -5, -4, -3, and -2) with clofarabine (40 mg/m(2) i.v. daily on days -5, -4, -3, and -2) conditioning before allogeneic 8/8 HLA-matched related or unrelated HSCT. The primary endpoint was donor neutrophil engraftment by day +40. Secondary endpoints included nonrelapse mortality (NRM), acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Thirty-four patients (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 25; myelodysplastic syndromes, n = 5; and acute lymphoid leukemia, n = 4) were enrolled. Day 40+ engraftment with donor chimerism was achieved in 33 of 34 patients with 1 patient dying before count recovery. Day 100 and 1-year NRM were 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 17.4) and 24% (95% CI, 11 to 39), respectively. The 2-year relapse rate was 26% (95% CI, 13 to 42).

Myelodysplastic syndromes following therapy with hypomethylating agents (HMAs): development of acute erythroleukemia may not influence assessment of treatment response.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2016-03-04,"This study followed 28 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who showed a rise of bone marrow (BM) erythroids to ≥ 50% following three cycles (1-60) of hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy. If BM blasts were calculated as a percentage of non-erythroids, 12 (42.9%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute erythroleukemia, erythroid/myeloid (AEL). However, none of the patients showed clonal cytogenetic evolution or new mutations. When compared to 47 de novo AEL patients, these 12 patients were less anemic and thrombocytopenic, had less complex karyotypes (p = 0.044) and showed a longer survival, either calculated from diagnosis (p < 0.001) or from the time of AEL (p = 0.005).

"Myelodysplastic syndromes: 2015 Update on diagnosis, risk-stratification and management.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-09-01,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a very heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias and increased risk of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). MDS occurs more frequently in older males and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry, or molecular genetics is complementary but not diagnostic. Risk-stratification: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly used system still is probably the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). IPSS is being replaced by the new revised score IPSS-R. Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts, and more recently cytogenetic and mutational profiles. Goals of therapy are different in lower risk patients than in higher risk. In lower risk, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, as well as to improve survival. In higher risk, the goal is to prolong survival. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, intensive chemotherapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of lenalidomide has significant clinical activity in patients with lower risk disease, anemia, and a chromosome 5 alteration. 5-Azacitidine and decitabine have activity in higher risk MDS. 5-Azacitidine has been shown to improve survival in higher risk MDS. A number of new molecular lesions have been described in MDS that may serve as new therapeutic targets or aid in the selection of currently available agents. Additional supportive care measures may include the use of prophylactic antibiotics and iron chelation. Management of progressive or refractory disease: At the present time there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after hypomethylating based therapy. Options include participation in a clinical trial or cytarabine based therapy and stem cell transplantation.",Journal Article,1603.0,66.0,myelodysplastic syndromes MDS heterogeneous group myeloid disorders characterized peripheral blood cytopenias increased risk transformation acute myelogenous leukemia AML MDS occurs frequently older males individuals prior exposure cytotoxic therapy Diagnosis MDS based morphological evidence dysplasia visual examination bone marrow aspirate biopsy Information obtained additional studies karyotype flow cytometry molecular genetics complementary diagnostic Risk-stratification Prognosis patients MDS calculated number scoring systems general scoring systems include peripheral cytopenias percentage blasts bone marrow cytogenetic characteristics commonly probably International Prognostic Scoring IPSS IPSS replaced new revised score IPSS-R Therapy selected based risk transfusion needs percent bone marrow blasts recently cytogenetic profiles Goals therapy different lower risk patients higher risk lower risk goal decrease transfusion needs transformation higher risk disease AML improve survival higher risk goal prolong survival Current available therapies include growth factor support lenalidomide hypomethylating agents intensive chemotherapy allogeneic stem transplantation use lenalidomide significant clinical activity patients lower risk disease anemia chromosome 5 alteration 5-Azacitidine decitabine activity higher risk MDS 5-Azacitidine shown improve survival higher risk MDS number new molecular lesions described MDS serve new therapeutic targets aid selection currently available agents Additional supportive care measures include use prophylactic antibiotics iron chelation Management progressive refractory disease present time approved interventions patients progressive refractory disease particularly hypomethylating based therapy Options include participation clinical trial cytarabine based therapy stem transplantation,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2040, 1223, 32, 8, 923, 1564, 87, 1, 533, 1997, 765, 20, 672, 315, 5635, 2, 101, 43, 1, 1392, 6, 286, 2194, 329, 1223, 1780, 80, 746, 4, 434, 2296, 2, 4, 869, 5, 324, 645, 6, 759, 36, 147, 1, 1223, 16, 90, 23, 4268, 241, 1, 2253, 1548, 3046, 1385, 1, 8, 581, 8022, 2, 411, 487, 683, 29, 402, 94, 225, 22, 3385, 1412, 1914, 15, 219, 2894, 16, 3380, 84, 44, 752, 43, 1541, 356, 1, 7, 5, 1223, 122, 40, 981, 75, 8, 207, 1, 2504, 1530, 4, 1083, 62, 46, 2504, 1530, 643, 65, 1, 672, 5635, 1150, 1, 2438, 4, 3, 581, 2, 1266, 374, 3, 96, 841, 95, 398, 1234, 16, 4061, 3, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 8751, 8751, 16, 486, 6928, 20, 3, 217, 4218, 368, 8751, 668, 36, 16, 715, 90, 23, 43, 2785, 1891, 714, 1, 581, 2438, 2, 80, 761, 1266, 2, 1619, 1241, 2802, 1, 36, 32, 338, 4, 280, 43, 7, 76, 4, 142, 43, 4, 280, 43, 3, 1326, 16, 6, 775, 2785, 1891, 2, 1392, 6, 142, 43, 34, 15, 329, 22, 149, 22, 6, 401, 25, 4, 142, 43, 3, 1326, 16, 6, 3615, 25, 291, 390, 235, 643, 129, 161, 538, 1288, 4931, 183, 1686, 56, 2, 1063, 452, 31, 497, 3, 119, 1, 1288, 71, 93, 38, 128, 4, 7, 5, 280, 43, 34, 1545, 2, 8, 1170, 33, 2611, 33, 3752, 2, 3004, 47, 128, 4, 142, 43, 1223, 33, 3752, 71, 85, 443, 6, 401, 25, 4, 142, 43, 1223, 8, 207, 1, 217, 219, 406, 47, 85, 1027, 4, 1223, 17, 68, 1833, 22, 217, 189, 637, 15, 2427, 4, 3, 881, 1, 694, 390, 183, 402, 1877, 165, 1018, 68, 643, 3, 119, 1, 1862, 5214, 2, 4231, 19709, 284, 1, 1014, 15, 430, 34, 28, 3, 364, 98, 125, 32, 77, 850, 1151, 9, 7, 5, 1014, 15, 430, 34, 823, 50, 4931, 90, 36, 838, 643, 2599, 4, 8, 38, 160, 15, 1855, 90, 36, 2, 452, 31, 497]",2316.0,26294090,Myelodysplastic syndromes 2015 Update diagnosis risk-stratification management,49,0.08551483420593368
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics with Extended Dosing of CC-486 in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-08-21,"CC-486 (oral azacitidine) is an epigenetic modifier in development for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. In part 1 of this two-part study, a 7-day CC-486 dosing schedule showed clinical activity, was generally well tolerated, and reduced DNA methylation. Extending dosing of CC-486 beyond 7 days would increase duration of azacitidine exposure. We hypothesized that extended dosing would therefore provide more sustained epigenetic activity. Reported here are the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CC-486 extended dosing schedules in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from part 2 of this study. PK and/or PD data were available for 59 patients who were sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 extended CC-486 dosing schedules: 300mg once-daily or 200mg twice-daily for 14 or 21 days per 28-day cycle. Both 300mg once-daily schedules and the 200mg twice-daily 21-day schedule significantly (all P < .05) reduced global DNA methylation in whole blood at all measured time points (days 15, 22, and 28 of the treatment cycle), with sustained hypomethylation at cycle end compared with baseline. CC-486 exposures and reduced DNA methylation were significantly correlated. Patients who had a hematologic response had significantly greater methylation reductions than non-responding patients. These data demonstrate that extended dosing of CC-486 sustains epigenetic effects through the treatment cycle.

"Safety and tolerability of guadecitabine (SGI-110) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia: a multicentre, randomised, dose-escalation phase 1 study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-08-19,"Hypomethylating agents are used to treat cancers driven by aberrant DNA methylation, but their short half-life might limit their activity, particularly in patients with less proliferative diseases. Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a novel hypomethylating dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase. We aimed to assess the safety and clinical activity of subcutaneously given guadecitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. In this multicentre, open-label, phase 1 study, patients from nine North American medical centres with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia that was refractory to or had relapsed after standard treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous guadecitabine, either once-daily for 5 consecutive days (daily × 5), or once-weekly for 3 weeks, in a 28-day treatment cycle. Patients were stratified by disease. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used in which we treated patients with guadecitabine doses of 3-125 mg/m(2) in separate dose-escalation cohorts. A twice-weekly treatment schedule was added to the study after a protocol amendment. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of guadecitabine, determine the maximum tolerated and biologically effective dose, and identify the recommended phase 2 dose of guadecitabine. Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of guadecitabine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses to determine the biologically effective dose included all patients for whom samples were available. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. Between Jan 4, 2011, and April 11, 2014, we enrolled and treated 93 patients: 35 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and nine patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the daily × 5 dose-escalation cohorts, 28 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the once-weekly dose-escalation cohorts, and 11 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and four patients with myelodysplastic syndrome in the twice-weekly dose-escalation cohorts. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were febrile neutropenia (38 [41%] of 93 patients), pneumonia (27 [29%] of 93 patients), thrombocytopenia (23 [25%] of 93 patients), anaemia (23 [25%] of 93 patients), and sepsis (16 [17%] of 93 patients). The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (29 [31%] of 93 patients), pneumonia (26 [28%] of 93 patients), and sepsis (16 [17%] of 93 patients). Six of the 74 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and six of the 19 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome had a clinical response to treatment. Two dose-limiting toxicities were noted in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome at 125 mg/m(2) daily × 5, thus the maximum tolerated dose in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 90 mg/m(2) daily × 5. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Potent dose-related DNA demethylation occurred on the daily × 5 regimen, reaching a plateau at 60 mg/m(2) (designated as the biologically effective dose). Guadecitabine given subcutaneously at 60 mg/m(2) daily × 5 is well tolerated and is clinically and biologically active in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. Guadecitabine 60 mg/m(2) daily × 5 is the recommended phase 2 dose, and these findings warrant further phase 2 studies.

"An International MDS/MPN Working Group's perspective and recommendations on molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical characterization of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.",Haematologica,Haematologica,2015-09-01,"In the 2008 WHO classification, chronic myeloid malignancies that share both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features define the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative group, which includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative unclassified. With the notable exception of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, there is much overlap among the various subtypes at the molecular and clinical levels, and a better definition of these entities, an understanding of their biology and an identification of subtype-specific molecular or cellular markers are needed. To address some of these challenges, a panel comprised of laboratory and clinical experts in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative was established, and four independent academic MDS/MPN workshops were held on: 9(th) March 2013, in Miami, Florida, USA; 6(th) December 2013, in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; 13(th) June 2014 in Milan, Italy; and 5(th) December 2014 in San Francisco, USA. During these meetings, the current understanding of these malignancies and matters of biology, diagnosis and management were discussed.

ABO blood group incompatibility as an adverse risk factor for outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia undergoing HLA-matched peripheral blood hematopoietic cell transplantation after reduced-intensity conditioning.,Transfusion,Transfusion,2015-10-07,"ABO incompatibility is not a contraindication to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), but it has been associated with additional risks including delayed engraftment, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), and higher transfusion needs. Data on these events and on patient survival after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT are limited. A total of 127 consecutive patients, 86 with acute myeloid leukemia and 41 with myelodysplastic syndromes, who underwent HLA-matched peripheral blood RIC allogenic HCT between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Eighty ABO-compatible, 26 major/bidirectional, and 21 minor-ABO-mismatch HCT were identified. Compared to the ABO-compatible group, major/bidirectional mismatches had increased red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirement during the first 100 days (p = 0.009), delayed RBC and PLT engraftment (p = 0.0011 and p = 0.005, respectively), and higher incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD; p = 0.037). In multivariable analysis, major/bidirectional mismatches had significantly higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and inferior disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with ABO-compatible patients (p = 0.01, p = 0.04, and p = 0.035, respectively). Minor ABO mismatch had no impact on survival (p = 0.99). Four (15%) of 26 major/bidirectional mismatches developed PRCA. There was a significant association between fludarabine plus busulfan conditioning and PRCA (p = 0.0046). Major/bidirectional ABO mismatch is associated with higher NRM and shortened DFS and OS in the setting of RIC HCT.

Oral Azacitidine (CC-486) for the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,The oncologist,Oncologist,2015-10-13,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid malignancies characterized by multilineage cytopenias, recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML, which can occur de novo as well as secondary to MDS, is characterized by malignant clones of myeloid lineage in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, with dissemination into tissues. The cytidine nucleoside analog and epigenetic modifier azacitidine is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of all French-American-British subtypes of MDS and in many countries for the treatment of AML with 20%-30% blasts and multilineage dysplasia according to the World Health Organization classification. Benefits of azacitidine treatment of patients with AML with >30% blasts have also been shown in a recent phase III trial. Oral administration of azacitidine may enhance patient convenience, eliminate injection-site reactions, allow for alternative dosing and scheduling, and enable long-term treatment. Phase I studies with oral azacitidine (CC-486) have shown biological activity, clinical responses, and tolerability in patients with MDS and AML. Extended dosing schedules of oral azacitidine (for 14 or 21 days of 28-day cycles) are currently under investigation as frontline therapy in patients with lower risk MDS, as maintenance therapy for patients with AML not eligible for stem cell transplant, and as maintenance therapy for patients with MDS or AML following stem cell transplant.

"Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) versus treatment of physician's choice in women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (BEACON): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-10-22,"New options are needed for patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer. Etirinotecan pegol is a long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor that prolongs exposure to, but reduces the toxicity of, SN38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan). We assessed whether etirinotecan pegol is superior to currently available treatments for patients with previously treated, locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. In this open-label, multicentre, randomised phase 3 study (BEACON; BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), conducted at 135 sites in 11 countries, patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (and two to five previous regimens for advanced disease) were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally via an interactive response system to etirinotecan pegol (145 mg/m(2) as a 90-min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) or single-drug treatment of physician's choice. Patients with stable brain metastases and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible. Randomisation was stratified with a permuted block scheme by region, previous eribulin, and receptor status. After randomisation, patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01492101. Between Dec 19, 2011, and Aug 20, 2013, 852 patients were randomly assigned; 429 to etirinotecan pegol and 423 to treatment of physician's choice. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups (median 12·4 months [95% CI 11·0-13·6] for the etirinotecan pegol group vs 10·3 months [9·0-11·3] for the treatment of physician's choice group; hazard ratio 0·87 [95% CI 0·75-1·02]; p=0·084). The safety population includes the 831 patients who received at least one dose of assigned treatment (425 assigned to etirinotecan pegol and 406 to treatment of physician's choice). Serious adverse events were recorded for 128 (30%) patients treated with etirinotecan pegol and 129 (32%) treated with treatment of physician's choice. Fewer patients in the etirinotecan pegol group had grade 3 or worse toxicity than those in the treatment of physician's choice group (204 [48%] vs 256 [63%]; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (41 [10%] in the experimental group vs five [1%] in the control group), neutropenia (41 [10%] vs 125 [31%]), and peripheral neuropathy (two [<1%] vs 15 [4%]). Three patients in the etirinotecan pegol group died of treatment-related adverse events (pneumonia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute renal failure) and two in the treatment of physician's choice group (neutropenic sepsis and septic shock). This trial did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival for etirinotecan pegol compared to treatment of physician's choice in patients with heavily pre-treated advanced breast cancer. The toxicity profile noted in the etirinotecan pegol group differed from that in the control group. In view of the frequency of cross-resistance and overlapping toxicities noted with many available drugs and the need for effective drugs in highly refractory disease, etirinotecan pegol may warrant further research in some subgroups of patients.

The Hedgehog pathway as targetable vulnerability with 5-azacytidine in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2015-10-20,"Therapy and outcome for elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients has not improved for many years. Similarly, there remains a clinical need to improve response rates in advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with hypomethylating agents, and few combination regimens have shown clinical benefit. We conducted a 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) RNA-interference (RNAi) sensitizer screen to identify gene targets within the commonly deleted regions (CDRs) of chromosomes 5 and 7, whose silencing enhances the activity of 5-Aza. An RNAi silencing screen of 270 genes from the CDRs of chromosomes 5 and 7 was performed in combination with 5-Aza treatment in four AML cell lines (TF-1, THP-1, MDS-L, and HEL). Several genes within the hedgehog pathway (HhP), specifically SHH, SMO, and GLI3, were identified as 5-Aza sensitizing hits. The smoothened (SMO) inhibitors LDE225 (erismodegib) and GDC0449 (vismodegib) showed moderate single-agent activity in AML cell lines. Further studies with erismodegib in combination with 5-Aza demonstrated synergistic activity with combination index (CI) values of 0.48 to 0.71 in seven AML lines. Clonogenic growth of primary patient samples was inhibited to a greater extent in the combination than with single-agent erismodegib or 5-Aza in 55 % (6 of 11) primary patient samples examined. There was no association of the 5-Aza/erismodegib sensitization potential to clinical-cytogenetic features or common myeloid mutations. Activation of the HhP, as determined by greater expression of HhP-related genes, showed less responsiveness to single-agent SMO inhibition, while synergy between both agents was similar regardless of HhP gene expression.

Pathol.,2015-11-01,"To develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach to detect CALR mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in a clinical laboratory. DNA was extracted from bone marrow aspirate samples of 67 JAK2 wild-type MPNs (22 with matched peripheral blood), 54 cases of unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome/MPN, and 16 cases of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. We used genomic DNA to detect somatic mutations in exon 9 of CALR and PCR with fluorescently labeled and M13-tagged primers and subjected the products to capillary electrophoresis (CE) followed by Sanger sequencing. Detailed assay performance characteristics were established. We identified CALR mutations in 19 (28.4%) of 67 JAK2-negative MPNs, including 14 type I (52-base pair [bp] deletion), four type II (5-bp insertions), and one type III (18-bp deletion). All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Sensitivity studies showed 2.5% and 5% mutation detection levels by CE and Sanger sequencing, respectively, with high reproducibility.

Genomic analysis of germ line and somatic variants in familial myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2015-10-22,"Familial clustering of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be caused by inherited factors. We screened 59 individuals from 17 families with 2 or more biological relatives with MDS/AML for variants in 12 genes with established roles in predisposition to MDS/AML, and identified a pathogenic germ line variant in 5 families (29%). Extending the screen with a panel of 264 genes that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML, we identified rare, nonsynonymous germ line variants in 4 genes, each segregating with MDS/AML in 2 families. Somatic mutations are required for progression to MDS/AML in these familial cases. Using a combination of targeted and exome sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples from 26 familial MDS/AML cases and asymptomatic carriers, we identified recurrent frameshift mutations in the cohesin-associated factor PDS5B, co-occurrence of somatic ASXL1 mutations with germ line GATA2 mutations, and recurrent mutations in other known MDS/AML drivers. Mutations in genes that are recurrently mutated in de novo AML were underrepresented in the familial MDS/AML cases, although the total number of somatic mutations per exome was the same. Lastly, clonal skewing of hematopoiesis was detected in 67% of young, asymptomatic RUNX1 carriers, providing a potential biomarker that could be used for surveillance in these high-risk families.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-10-31,"The recovery pace of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is prognostic after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Previous studies have evaluated a wide range of ALC cutoffs and time points for predicting outcomes. We aimed to determine the optimal ALC value for outcome prediction after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). A total of 518 patients who underwent BMT for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 1999 and 2010 were divided into a training set and a test set to assess the prognostic value of ALC on days 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, as well as the first post-transplantation day of an ALC of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 1000/μL. In the training set, the best predictor of overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was ALC on day 60. In the entire patient cohort, multivariable analyses demonstrated significantly better OS, RFS, and NRM and lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with an ALC >300/μL on day 60 post-BMT, both including and excluding patients who developed GVHD before day 60. Among the patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors assessed, only busulfan-based conditioning was significantly associated with higher ALC values on day 60 in both cohorts.

Detectable FLT3-ITD or RAS mutation at the time of transformation from MDS to AML predicts for very poor outcomes.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2015-10-19,"The molecular events that drive the transformation from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have yet to be fully characterized. We hypothesized that detection of these mutations at the time of transformation from MDS to AML may lead to poorer outcomes. We analyzed 102 MDS patients who were admitted to our institution between 2004 and 2013, had wild-type (wt) FLT3-ITD and RAS at diagnosis, progressed to AML, and had serial mutation testing at both the MDS and AML stages.

Two agents that inhibit the Plk signaling pathway have shown promising activity in patients with hematologic malignancies and are currently in phase III trials. Volasertib is a Plk inhibitor under evaluation combined with low-dose cytarabine in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive induction therapy. Rigosertib, a dual inhibitor of the Plk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, is under investigation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have failed azacitidine or decitabine treatment. The prognosis for patients with AML, who are ineligible for intensive induction therapy, and for those with MDS refractory/relapsed after a hypomethylating agent, remains poor.

Donor Lymphocyte Infusion in Hematologic Malignancies--Good to be Fresh?,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2015-11-03,"Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been used with variable success in a variety of hematologic malignancies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who were treated with DLI for persistent or relapsed disease at the Temple University Bone Marrow Transplant Unit from July 1, 1993 to December 31, 2013 to evaluate the effect of the type of DLI (fresh vs. cryopreserved) on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 64.8 months (range, 0.3-142.6 months). We found that EFS and OS were similar between patients receiving cryopreserved cells and those receiving fresh DLI (median OS for cryopreserved cells, 0.39 years; median OS for fresh cells, 0.32 years; P = .793; median EFS for cryopreserved cells, 0.410 years; median EFS for fresh cells, 0.420 years; P = .4264). In the setting of relapsed disease, treatment with any chemotherapy regimen before receiving DLI did not significantly impact OS (n = 63; P = .2203) or EFS (n = 40; P = .542). A subgroup analysis limited to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (32 patients) showed that differences in OS and EFS between cryopreserved and fresh DLI approached significance (median OS for cryopreserved cells, 0.34 years; median OS for fresh cells, 0.17 years; P = .16; median EFS for cryopreserved cells, 0.37 years; median EFS for fresh cells, 0.094 years; P = 0.11).

"Sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia: a single-arm, phase 1/2 study.",The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2014-12-22,"The standard of care for myelodysplastic syndromes is hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine. However, responses to azacitidine are generally temporary, and outcomes after hypomethylating agent failure are dismal. Therefore, the development of more effective treatments is crucial to improve outcomes in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We aimed to assess azacitidine and lenalidomide in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. We did this single-arm phase 1/2 study at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX, USA. Patients of any age were eligible for phase 1 and 2a if they had relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with bone marrow blasts more than 10%. For phase 2b, eligible participants were previously untreated with myelodysplastic syndrome with an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score of intermediate-1 or higher with up to 30% blasts. All participants received 75 mg/m(2) azacitidine once a day for days 1-5 for each 28 day cycle. We gave patients oral lenalidomide for 5 or 10 days starting on day 6. We assessed seven lenalidomide doses in a 3 + 3 phase 1 design (n=28). The primary endpoint in phase 1 was the maximum tolerated dose, and the primary endpoint in phase 2 was overall survival. Outcome analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01038635. Between Dec 30, 2009, and June, 17, 2013, we enrolled 88 patients (28 in phase 1 and 60 in phase 2). One patient unexpectedly died in the phase 1 study at the highest dose level, six more patients were recruited with no further serious adverse events. We recorded no dose-limiting toxic effects, and the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with azacitidine in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome was initially established at 50 mg per day for 10 days. In the first 20 patients in phase 2, we noted a high rate of myelosuppression and myelosuppression-related toxic effects; therefore, we amended the lenalidomide dose to 25 mg per day for 5 days. We also adjusted the inclusion criteria to include patients with less than 30% blasts to focus mainly on patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Median overall survival was 75 weeks (IQR 25-not reached) for the 40 patients in phase 2b. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events overall were neutropenic fever (n=27) and pneumonia (n=18).

Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2015-07-26,"Activation of the Hedgehog signalling pathway contributes to cancer progression and the development of myeloid leukaemia stem cell therapeutic resistance. We aimed to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose of the selective Hedgehog antagonist PF-04449913 in myeloid malignancies. We undertook an open-label, dose-finding, standard 3+3 design phase 1 study of PF-04449913 in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myelofibrosis who were refractory, resistant, or intolerant to previous treatments, at three centres in the USA and one in Italy. Patients who had newly diagnosed, untreated disease were included if they were not eligible for standard treatment options or if standard treatments were not deemed appropriate. Patients received PF-04449913 once daily continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or patient withdrawal for up to 12 28-day cycles. Additional cycles were given if patients showed evidence of clinical benefit. The starting dose was 5 mg and was increased by 100% until the first dose-limiting toxic effect (DLT) and by 50% thereafter, in keeping with a 3+3 clinical trial statistical design. The primary endpoint was first-cycle DLTs. Secondary endpoints were safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00953758. Between March 24, 2010, and Sept 7, 2012, 47 patients were enrolled and included in the study: 28 with acute myeloid leukaemia, six with myelodysplastic syndrome, five with chronic myeloid leukaemia (two with chronic-phase and three with blast-phase disease), one with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and seven with myelofibrosis. Patients received PF-04449913 once daily at 5 mg (n=3), 10 mg (n=3), 20 mg (n=4), 40 mg (n=4), 80 mg (n=8), 120 mg (n=3), 180 mg (n=3), 270 mg (n=5), 400 mg (n=9), and 600 mg (n=5). Two patients experienced DLTs (one each in the 80 mg and 600 mg dose groups). The MTD for PF-04449913 was established to be 400 mg once daily. Of the 47 patients enrolled, 28 (60%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, three of which were grade 4 in severity. The most common treatment-related adverse events included dysgeusia (13 [28%] patients), decreased appetite (nine [19%]), and alopecia (seven [15%]). None of the 15 deaths reported were treatment related. Pharmacokinetics seemed to be dose proportional. The mean half-life was 23·9 h (SD 14·0) in the MTD group. Some suggestion of clinical activity was noted in 23 (49%) of 47 patients with haematological malignancies. Based on these results, the recommended phase 2 dose was 200 mg or lower once daily. Based on these findings, PF-04449913 is being tested in phase 2 studies in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia, and myelofibrosis.

Novel germ line DDX41 mutations define families with a lower age of MDS/AML onset and lymphoid malignancies.,Blood,Blood,2015-12-28,"Recently our group and others have identified DDX41 mutations both as germ line and acquired somatic mutations in families with multiple cases of late onset myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that DDX41 acts as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. We also show that most asymptomatic mutation carriers have normal blood counts until malignancy develops. This study expands both the mutation and phenotypic spectra observed in families with germ line DDX41 mutations. With an increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in this gene being identified, further study of how DDX41 disruption leads to hematologic malignancies is critical.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2015-12-29,"We defined associations among immune cell subsets in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized allografts and clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Fresh peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) aliquots from 238 G-CSF-mobilized allografts were extensively characterized by immunophenotype. Subset-specific transplanted cells were correlated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), malignant disease relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival. Of 238 assessable alloHCT recipients, 185 patients (78%) received reduced-intensity conditioning and 152 (64%) antithymocyte globulin-based serotherapy. Incidences of aGVHD and cGVHD were 58% and 48%, respectively. Median follow-up was 21 months (range, 1.4 to 41.1). In multivariable analyses adjusted for relevant clinical factors, allograft activated natural killer (NK) cells (CD56(+)CD16(+)CD69(+)CD158b(+)) were associated with a significantly lower risk of aGVHD (P = .0016; HR, .51; 95% confidence interval, .33 to .78), whereas late-activated HLA-DR(+) CD3(+) cells were associated with significantly higher aGVHD (P < .0005; HR, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 3.43). In a subgroup of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), receipt of an allograft from an older donor (≥40 years) was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (P = .0042; HR, 2.99); allograft content of early activated CD3(+) cells (CD3(+)CD69(+); P = .0024; HR, .4) and NKT cells (CD3(+)CD56(+); P = .0006; HR, .54) were associated with a lower incidence of relapse. Presence of HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) genotype was associated with lower relapse incidence. In conclusion, activated NK cells within PBSC allografts associate with lower aGVHD risk, whereas HLA-DR(+) T cells associate with higher aGVHD and cGVHD risk. NKT cells and early activated T cells are associated with lower relapse risk in AML and MDS patients. These findings may have implications in therapeutic targeting of select populations in the allograft to minimize incidence of GVHD.",Journal Article,1484.0,12.0,defined associations immune subsets granulocyte colony-stimulating factor G-CSF -mobilized allografts clinical outcomes allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation alloHCT Fresh peripheral blood stem PBSC aliquots 238 G-CSF-mobilized allografts extensively characterized immunophenotype Subset-specific transplanted correlated acute graft-versus-host disease aGVHD chronic GVHD cGVHD malignant disease relapse nonrelapse mortality overall survival 238 assessable alloHCT recipients 185 patients 78 received reduced-intensity conditioning 152 64 antithymocyte globulin-based serotherapy Incidences aGVHD cGVHD 58 48 respectively Median follow-up 21 months range 1.4 41.1 multivariable adjusted relevant clinical factors allograft activated natural killer NK CD56 CD16 CD69 CD158b associated significantly lower risk aGVHD P .0016 HR .51 95 confidence interval .33 .78 late-activated HLA-DR CD3 associated significantly higher aGVHD P .0005 HR 2.31 95 confidence interval 1.55 3.43 subgroup patients acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS receipt allograft older donor ≥40 years associated higher incidence relapse P .0042 HR 2.99 allograft content early activated CD3 CD3 CD69 P .0024 HR .4 NKT CD3 CD56 P .0006 HR .54 associated lower incidence relapse Presence HLA-Bw4-80Ile genotype associated lower relapse incidence activated NK PBSC allografts associate lower aGVHD risk HLA-DR associate higher aGVHD cGVHD risk NKT early activated associated lower relapse risk AML MDS patients findings implications therapeutic targeting select populations allograft minimize incidence GVHD,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 395, 685, 107, 250, 31, 1890, 4, 2764, 1975, 2122, 161, 499, 1211, 7695, 10586, 2, 38, 123, 50, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 5514, 4329, 672, 315, 452, 31, 6368, 16390, 29, 6883, 499, 1211, 7695, 10586, 11, 3576, 765, 20, 5496, 697, 112, 4600, 37, 11, 438, 5, 286, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 5873, 442, 1562, 6670, 393, 34, 429, 4640, 282, 2, 63, 25, 1, 6883, 3120, 5514, 2190, 5805, 7, 833, 103, 405, 837, 1933, 2, 5370, 660, 11016, 7819, 90, 37444, 3981, 1, 5873, 2, 6670, 11, 717, 2, 576, 106, 52, 166, 126, 10, 239, 53, 184, 14, 39, 6, 605, 14, 4, 658, 318, 586, 9, 867, 38, 130, 9568, 735, 1504, 3458, 1765, 37, 5803, 11287, 16337, 40616, 11, 41, 5, 8, 97, 280, 43, 1, 5873, 19, 13230, 168, 725, 48, 307, 268, 466, 6, 833, 547, 807, 735, 1160, 3436, 3117, 37, 11, 41, 5, 97, 142, 5873, 19, 4252, 168, 18, 456, 48, 307, 268, 14, 614, 6, 27, 601, 4, 8, 1363, 1, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 1699, 1, 35, 9568, 29, 35, 434, 1488, 8483, 60, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 287, 1, 429, 19, 21111, 168, 18, 1058, 9568, 2457, 1, 191, 735, 3117, 37, 3117, 16337, 19, 14804, 168, 39, 2, 15761, 37, 3117, 5803, 19, 6013, 168, 667, 11, 41, 5, 8, 280, 287, 1, 429, 463, 1, 1160, 41315, 67454, 1183, 10, 41, 5, 280, 429, 287, 4, 1221, 735, 1765, 37, 262, 6368, 10586, 6446, 5, 280, 5873, 43, 547, 1160, 3436, 102, 37, 6446, 5, 142, 5873, 2, 6670, 43, 15761, 37, 2, 191, 735, 102, 37, 32, 41, 5, 280, 429, 43, 4, 329, 2, 1223, 7, 46, 272, 68, 47, 1268, 4, 189, 529, 1, 1717, 1184, 4, 3, 9568, 6, 3241, 287, 1, 1562]",1952.0,26743340,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor-Mobilized Allografts Contain Activated Immune Subsets Associated Risk Acute Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease,0,0.0
Phase II Study of Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusion for Treatment of Relapsed or Persistent Myeloid Malignancies Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-01-06,"We conducted a phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of HLA-haploidentical related donor natural killer (NK) cells after cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion in patients with relapsed or progressive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Eight patients (2 with MDS and 6 with AML) were treated with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on day -3 and day -2 before infusion of NK cells isolated from a haploidentical related donor. One patient also received fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day for 4 days. Six doses of 1 million units of interleukin-2 (IL-2) were administered on alternating days beginning on day -1. The median number of NK cells infused was 10.6 × 10(6)/kg (range, 4.3 to 22.4 × 10(6)/kg), and the median number of CD3 cells infused was 2.1 × 10(3)/kg (range, 1.9 to 40 × 10(3)/kg). NK infusions were well tolerated, with a median time to neutrophil recovery of 19 days (range, 7 days to not achieved) and no incidence of graft-versus-host disease after NK infusion. One patient with AML and 1 patient with MDS achieved a complete response, but relapsed at 1.7 and 1.8 months, respectively. One patient with MDS experienced resolution of dysplastic features but persistence of clonal karyotype abnormalities; this patient was stable at 65 months after NK cell therapy. The median duration of survival was 12.9 months (range, 0.8 to 65.3 months). Chimerism analysis of CD3(-)/CD56(+) peripheral blood cells did not detect any circulating haploidentical NK cells after infusion. NK phenotyping was performed in 7 patients during and after IL-2 infusion. We found a slight trend toward greater expression of KIR2DL2/2DL3/2DS2 (5% versus 28%; P = .03) at 14 days in patients who survived longer than 6 months from NK cell infusion (n = 4) compared with those who died within 6 months of NK cell therapy (n = 3). In summary, our data support the safety of haploidentical NK cell infusion after allogeneic HCT.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1476.0,40.0,conducted phase 2 determine efficacy HLA-haploidentical related donor natural killer NK cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion patients relapsed progressive acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS following allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation HCT patients 2 MDS 6 AML treated cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg day -3 day -2 infusion NK isolated haploidentical related donor patient received fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day 4 days doses 1 million units interleukin-2 IL-2 administered alternating days beginning day -1 median number NK infused 10.6 10 6 /kg range 4.3 22.4 10 6 /kg median number CD3 infused 2.1 10 3 /kg range 1.9 40 10 3 /kg NK infusions tolerated median time neutrophil recovery 19 days range 7 days achieved incidence graft-versus-host disease NK infusion patient AML 1 patient MDS achieved complete response relapsed 1.7 1.8 months respectively patient MDS experienced resolution dysplastic features persistence clonal karyotype abnormalities patient stable 65 months NK therapy median duration survival 12.9 months range 0.8 65.3 months Chimerism CD3 /CD56 peripheral blood detect circulating haploidentical NK infusion NK phenotyping performed 7 patients IL-2 infusion slight trend greater expression KIR2DL2/2DL3/2DS2 5 versus 28 P .03 14 days patients survived longer 6 months NK infusion n 4 compared died 6 months NK therapy n 3 summary support safety haploidentical NK infusion allogeneic HCT,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 426, 8, 124, 18, 45, 6, 223, 3, 209, 1, 1160, 5802, 139, 1488, 1504, 3458, 1765, 37, 50, 1112, 90, 16876, 4, 7, 5, 591, 15, 1014, 286, 2194, 329, 15, 681, 1223, 366, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 659, 7, 18, 5, 1223, 2, 49, 5, 329, 11, 73, 5, 1112, 212, 81, 503, 23, 218, 27, 2, 218, 18, 348, 904, 1, 1765, 37, 1355, 29, 8, 5802, 139, 1488, 104, 69, 120, 103, 2027, 243, 81, 821, 218, 9, 39, 162, 437, 415, 1, 14, 3346, 2960, 1, 1603, 18, 501, 18, 11, 468, 23, 5181, 162, 2948, 23, 218, 14, 3, 52, 207, 1, 1765, 37, 4524, 10, 79, 49, 79, 49, 503, 184, 39, 27, 6, 350, 39, 79, 49, 503, 2, 3, 52, 207, 1, 3117, 37, 4524, 10, 18, 14, 79, 27, 503, 184, 14, 83, 6, 327, 79, 27, 503, 1765, 3435, 11, 149, 421, 5, 8, 52, 98, 6, 2595, 1602, 1, 326, 162, 184, 67, 162, 6, 44, 513, 2, 77, 287, 1, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 50, 1765, 904, 104, 69, 5, 329, 2, 14, 69, 5, 1223, 513, 8, 236, 51, 84, 591, 28, 14, 67, 2, 14, 66, 53, 106, 104, 69, 5, 1223, 592, 2125, 1, 6461, 404, 84, 4108, 1, 1946, 3385, 1171, 26, 69, 10, 585, 28, 556, 53, 50, 1765, 31, 36, 3, 52, 654, 1, 25, 10, 133, 83, 53, 184, 13, 66, 6, 556, 27, 53, 6047, 65, 1, 3117, 5803, 672, 315, 37, 205, 44, 1426, 500, 1033, 5802, 1765, 37, 50, 904, 1765, 16526, 10, 173, 4, 67, 7, 190, 2, 50, 501, 18, 904, 21, 204, 8, 8041, 853, 1317, 378, 55, 1, 31546, 67490, 67491, 33, 185, 339, 19, 680, 28, 213, 162, 4, 7, 54, 2996, 589, 76, 49, 53, 29, 1765, 31, 904, 78, 39, 72, 5, 135, 54, 1016, 262, 49, 53, 1, 1765, 31, 36, 78, 27, 4, 1962, 114, 74, 538, 3, 367, 1, 5802, 1765, 31, 904, 50, 1063, 1085]",1899.0,26772158,Phase II Haploidentical Natural Killer Infusion Treatment Relapsed Persistent Myeloid Malignancies Following Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation,0,0.0

Thoracolumbar spinal cord tolerance to high dose conformal proton-photon radiation therapy.,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,Radiother Oncol,2016-01-11,"To evaluate and understand the tolerance of the thoracolumbar spinal cord using equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis after combined high dose photon-proton radiotherapy. A total of 68 patients were identified as having high dose radiotherapy, ⩾5900cGy (RBE) in the region of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, defined as extending inferiorly to L2. Pathological diagnosis for patients in this review included chordoma (50 patients, 53.1%), chondrosarcoma (28 patients, 29.8%), osteosarcoma (3 patients, 3.2%), other sarcoma (11 patients, 11.7%), and other (2 patients, 2.1%). Patient data were reviewed retrospectively, detailed dose volume histogram data (DVH) were available for 23 patients. Composite plans and DVH were constructed for both pre-operative and post-operative radiation therapy courses in MIM-Vista software, as available. Dose constraints to the center and surface of the cord were 5400cGy (RBE), and 6300cGy (RBE) respectively, and patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy received an eight percent dose reduction. Spinal cord toxicity was recorded using the RTOG/EORTC late effects scoring system. Clinical and dosimetric data for each patient were analyzed. Median prescription dose was 7020cGy (RBE), range (5940-7820cGy (RBE)). Median follow-up was 12.9months. Five-year overall survival for all patients in this group was 88.7%, 95%CI (74.7-95.2). One patient suffered from transient paralysis following stem cell transplant for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Other reasons for spinal cord injury following treatment included: local disease progression, noted in 7 patients (10.3%), and direct result of surgery, noted in 8 patients (11.8%).

Impact of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with myeloid neoplasms carrying spliceosomal mutations.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-03-14,"Molecular predictors of outcome are increasingly important in determining optimal therapy for myeloid neoplasms. Mutations in the spliceosomal genes (U2AF1 and SRSF2) predict for poor outcomes in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related diseases. We investigated the effect of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) on the negative prognostic impact of U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations. In total, 122 patients with MDS (30%), acute myeloid leukemia (51%), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (11%), and MDS/MPN (8%) receiving a HCT from 2003 to 2012 were evaluated for mutations in U2AF1 and SRSF2 by direct sequencing. Median time of follow up was 24 months (range 0.46-110). SRSF2 mutations were detected in 11 (10%) patients and U2AF1 in 3 (3%) patients. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between mutated and wild-type (WT) patients. Patients carrying SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations had similar overall survival (P = 0.84), relapse mortality (P = 0.50), and non-relapse mortality (P = 0.72) compared to WT patients.

Interactions and relevance of blast percentage and treatment strategy among younger and older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-02-01,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined as ≥20% myeloblasts, representing a change from original guidelines where ≤30% blasts were considered as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 20-29% blasts classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T). Whether the diagnostic bone marrow blast percentage has current value with regards to patient prognostication or identification of optimal treatment strategies is unclear. We retrospectively studied 1652 treatment-naïve adults with MDS or AML and ≥10% blasts from January 2000 to April 2014. Patients with 20-29% blasts were more similar to MDS patients in terms of advanced age, increased frequency of poor-risk cytogenetics, lower WBC count, and less frequent NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations. Median overall survival of MDS and RAEB-T were similar, 16.0 and 16.0 months, compared to 13.5 months for AML with ≥30% blasts (P = 0.045). Multivariate analysis showed inferior survival with increased age (HR 1.81 age 60-69, HR 2.68 age ≥70, P < 0.0005); poor-risk cytogenetics (HR 2.25, P < 0.0005); therapy-related disease (HR 1.44, P < 0.0005); and markers of proliferative disease including WBC ≥25 × 10(9) /L (HR 1.35, P = 0.0003), elevated LDH count (HR 1.24, P = 0.0015), and peripheral blasts (HR 1.25, P = 0.004). Among younger patients (≤60 years), intensive AML-type therapy resulted in similar outcomes regardless of blast percentage, suggesting this to be optimal therapy in this context. Among older patients (≥70 years), patients with 20-29% blasts had similar outcomes to patients with <20% blasts, and better than those with ≥30% blasts.

Lost in translation? Ten years of development of histone deacetylase inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,2016-01-01,"Epigenetic changes and mutations in epigenetic modifiers characterize and likely drive many cases of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Development of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors has been most successful in these diseases. While many epigenetic marks are potential targets of cancer therapies, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have undergone the most advanced development to date. In this review, the authors describe and discuss the biology and the clinical results of HDAC inhibitors in the settings of myeloid malignancies. While significant results have been achieved in lymphoma and myeloma, efficacy remains limited in myeloid malignancies for both single agent and HDACi based combination regimens. The redundancy and the pleiotropic activity of HDACi (on both histone and non-histone proteins) are key factors that have limited to date the selection of patients and the design of robust biomarkers.

The NAE inhibitor pevonedistat interacts with the HDAC inhibitor belinostat to target AML cells by disrupting the DDR.,Blood,Blood,2016-02-05,"Two classes of novel agents, NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, have shown single-agent activity in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Here we examined mechanisms underlying interactions between the NAE inhibitor pevonedistat (MLN4924) and the approved HDAC inhibitor belinostat in AML/MDS cells. MLN4924/belinostat coadministration synergistically induced AML cell apoptosis with or without p53 deficiency or FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), whereas p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or enforced FLT3-ITD expression significantly sensitized cells to the regimen. MLN4924 blocked belinostat-induced antiapoptotic gene expression through nuclear factor-κB inactivation. Each agent upregulated Bim, and Bim knockdown significantly attenuated apoptosis. Microarrays revealed distinct DNA damage response (DDR) genetic profiles between individual vs combined MLN4924/belinostat exposure. Whereas belinostat abrogated the MLN4924-activated intra-S checkpoint through Chk1 and Wee1 inhibition/downregulation, cotreatment downregulated multiple homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining repair proteins, triggering robust double-stranded breaks, chromatin pulverization, and apoptosis. Consistently, Chk1 or Wee1 shRNA knockdown significantly sensitized AML cells to MLN4924. MLN4924/belinostat displayed activity against primary AML or MDS cells, including those carrying next-generation sequencing-defined poor-prognostic cancer hotspot mutations, and CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) populations, but not normal CD34(+) progenitors.

Autoimmune diseases and myelodysplastic syndromes.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2016-04-04,"Immune dysregulation and altered T-cell hemostasis play important roles in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Recent studies suggest an increased risk of MDS among patients with autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases among MDS patients, comparing characteristics and outcomes in those with and without autoimmune diseases. From our study group of 1408 MDS patients, 391 (28%) had autoimmune disease, with hypothyroidism being the most common type, accounting for 44% (n = 171) of patients (12% among all MDS patients analyzed). Other autoimmune diseases with ≥5% prevalence included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in 12% (n = 46), rheumatoid arthritis in 10% (n = 41), and psoriasis in 7% (n = 28) of patients. Autoimmune diseases were more common in female MDS patients, those with RA or RCMD WHO subtype, and those who were less dependent on red blood cell transfusion. Median overall survival (OS) was 60 months (95% CI, 50-70) for patients with autoimmune diseases versus 45 months (95% CI, 40-49) for those without (log-rank test, P = 0.006). By multivariate analysis adjusting for revised IPSS and age >60 years, autoimmune diseases were a statistically significant independent factor for OS (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92; P = 0.004). The rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation was 23% (n = 89) in MDS patients with autoimmune disease versus 30% (n = 301) in those without (P = 0.011).

Myelodysplastic Syndrome Revealed by Systems Immunology in a Melanoma Patient Undergoing Anti-PD-1 Therapy.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2016-03-10,"Antibodies aimed at blocking the interaction between programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands have shown impressive efficacy in a variety of malignancies and are generally well tolerated. Research has focused intensely on T cells and their interaction with cells within melanoma tumors, while relatively little is understood about the systems immunology of the cells in the blood during checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Longitudinal cytomic analysis using mass cytometry can characterize all the cells in a small sample of blood and has the potential to reveal key shifts in the cellular milieu occurring during treatment. We report a case of advanced melanoma in which mass cytometry detected abnormal myeloid cells resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the blood following treatment with an anti-PD-1 agent. Myeloid blasts comprised <1% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 1 month after the start of treatment. Six months after starting therapy, myeloid blasts comprised 5% of PBMCs, and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (RAEB-2). Longitudinal mass cytometry immunophenotyping comprehensively characterized blast phenotype evolution and revealed elevated PD-1 expression on the surface of nonblast myeloid cells. These findings highlight the clinical significance of cytomic monitoring, indicate that the myeloid compartment should be monitored during checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and emphasize the value of systems immunology in medicine.

Activity of the oral mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor trametinib in RAS-mutant relapsed or refractory myeloid malignancies.,Cancer,Cancer,2016-03-18,"RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation is common in myeloid malignancies. Trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)/MEK2 inhibitor with activity against multiple myeloid cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, was evaluated for safety and clinical activity in patients with relapsed/refractory leukemias. This phase 1/2 study accrued patients with any relapsed/refractory leukemia in phase 1. In phase 2, this study accrued patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with NRAS or KRAS mutations (cohort 1); patients with AML, MDS, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with a RAS wild-type mutation or an unknown mutation status (cohort 2); and patients with CMML with an NRAS or KRAS mutation (cohorts 3). The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. The phase 2 recommended dose for Trametinib was 2 mg orally daily. The overall response rates were 20%, 3%, and 27% for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and this indicated preferential activity among RAS-mutated myeloid malignancies. Repeated cycles of trametinib were well tolerated with manageable or reversible toxicities; these results were similar to those of other trametinib studies.

Haploidentical Natural Killer Cells Infused before Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Myeloid Malignancies: A Phase I Trial.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-04-16,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an effective treatment for high-risk myeloid malignancies, but relapse remains the major post-transplantation cause of treatment failure. Alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells mediate a potent antileukemic effect and may also enhance engraftment and reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Haploidentical transplantations provide a setting in which NK cell alloreactivity can be manipulated, but they are associated with high rates of GVHD. We performed a phase I study infusing escalating doses of NK cells from an HLA haploidentical-related donor-selected for alloreactivity when possible-as a component of the preparative regimen for allotransplantation from a separate HLA-identical donor. The goal of infusing third-party alloreactive NK cells was to augment the antileukemic effect of the transplantation without worsening GVHD and, thus, improve the overall outcome of hematopoietic transplantation. Twenty-one patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia refractory or beyond first remission received a preparative regimen with busulfan and fludarabine followed by infusion of apheresis-derived, antibody-selected, and IL-2-activated NK cells. Doses were initially based on total nucleated cell (TNC) content and later based on CD56(+) cells to reduce variability. CD56(+) content ranged from .02 to 8.32 × 10(6)/kg. IL-2, .5 × 10(6) units/m(2) subcutaneously was administered daily for 5 days in the final cohort (n = 10). CD3(+) cells in the NK cell product were required to be < 10(5)/kg. Median relapse-free, overall, and GVHD-free/relapse-free survival for all patients enrolled was 102, 233, and 89 days, respectively. Five patients are alive, 5 patients died of transplantation-related causes, and 11 patients died of relapse. Despite the small sample size, survival was highly associated with CD56(+) cells delivered (P = .022) and development of ≥ grade 3 GVHD (P = .006). There were nonsignificant trends toward higher survival rates in those receiving NK cells from KIR ligand-mismatched donors and KIR-B haplotype donors. There was no association with disease type, remission at time of transplantation, or KIR content. GVHD was not associated with TNC, CD56(+), or CD3(+) cells infused in the NK cell product or the stem cell product. This trial demonstrates a lack of major toxicity attributable to third-party NK cell infusions delivered in combination with an HLA-compatible allogeneic transplantation. The infusion of haploidentical alloreactive NK cells was well tolerated and did not interfere with engraftment or increase the rate of GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation. Durable complete remissions occurred in 5 patients at high risk for disease recurrence. This approach is being further developed in a phase I/II trial with ex vivo-expanded NK cells to increase the NK cell dose with the objective of reducing relapse and improving the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation for AML/MDS.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1375.0,41.0,Allogeneic stem transplantation effective treatment high-risk myeloid malignancies relapse remains major post-transplantation cause treatment failure Alloreactive natural killer NK mediate potent antileukemic effect enhance engraftment reduce graft-versus-host disease GVHD Haploidentical transplantations provide setting NK alloreactivity manipulated associated high rates GVHD performed phase infusing escalating doses NK HLA haploidentical-related donor-selected alloreactivity possible-as component preparative regimen allotransplantation separate HLA-identical donor goal infusing third-party alloreactive NK augment antileukemic effect transplantation worsening GVHD improve overall outcome hematopoietic transplantation Twenty-one patients high-risk acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS chronic myelogenous leukemia refractory remission received preparative regimen busulfan fludarabine followed infusion apheresis-derived antibody-selected IL-2-activated NK Doses initially based total nucleated TNC content later based CD56 reduce variability CD56 content ranged .02 8.32 10 6 /kg IL-2 .5 10 6 units/m 2 subcutaneously administered daily 5 days final cohort n 10 CD3 NK product required 10 5 /kg Median relapse-free overall GVHD-free/relapse-free survival patients enrolled 102 233 89 days respectively patients alive 5 patients died transplantation-related causes 11 patients died relapse Despite small size survival highly associated CD56 delivered P .022 development ≥ grade 3 GVHD P .006 nonsignificant trends higher survival rates receiving NK KIR ligand-mismatched donors KIR-B haplotype donors association disease type remission time transplantation KIR content GVHD associated TNC CD56 CD3 infused NK product stem product trial demonstrates lack major toxicity attributable third-party NK infusions delivered combination HLA-compatible allogeneic transplantation infusion haploidentical alloreactive NK tolerated interfere engraftment increase rate GVHD allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation Durable complete remissions occurred 5 patients high risk disease recurrence approach developed phase I/II trial ex vivo-expanded NK increase NK dose objective reducing relapse improving outcome allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation AML/MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1063, 452, 31, 497, 16, 35, 323, 24, 9, 64, 43, 533, 441, 84, 429, 469, 3, 458, 539, 497, 708, 1, 24, 496, 13831, 1504, 3458, 1765, 37, 3367, 8, 1157, 4512, 254, 2, 68, 120, 1304, 2881, 2, 969, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 5802, 6779, 377, 8, 546, 4, 92, 1765, 31, 22039, 122, 40, 13222, 84, 491, 32, 41, 5, 64, 151, 1, 1562, 21, 173, 8, 124, 70, 45, 21343, 2922, 415, 1, 1765, 37, 29, 35, 1160, 5802, 139, 1488, 715, 9, 22039, 198, 899, 22, 8, 1249, 1, 3, 6085, 477, 9, 37175, 29, 8, 2282, 1160, 3038, 1488, 3, 1326, 1, 21343, 1282, 11429, 13831, 1765, 37, 10, 6, 4369, 3, 4512, 254, 1, 3, 497, 187, 4323, 1562, 2, 631, 401, 3, 63, 228, 1, 1007, 497, 737, 104, 7, 5, 64, 43, 286, 533, 329, 681, 1223, 15, 442, 2194, 430, 15, 1654, 157, 734, 103, 8, 6085, 477, 5, 3906, 2, 2027, 370, 20, 904, 1, 9456, 526, 548, 715, 2, 501, 18, 735, 1765, 37, 415, 11, 1625, 90, 23, 181, 9862, 31, 20000, 2457, 2, 1559, 90, 23, 5803, 37, 6, 969, 1982, 5803, 2457, 1869, 29, 588, 6, 66, 531, 79, 49, 503, 501, 18, 33, 79, 49, 2960, 188, 18, 3928, 10, 468, 391, 9, 33, 162, 4, 3, 1457, 180, 78, 79, 3117, 37, 4, 3, 1765, 31, 2821, 11, 616, 6, 40, 79, 33, 503, 52, 429, 115, 63, 2, 1562, 115, 429, 115, 25, 9, 62, 7, 346, 10, 2867, 7005, 2, 887, 162, 106, 365, 7, 32, 1701, 33, 7, 1016, 1, 497, 139, 1626, 2, 175, 7, 1016, 1, 429, 550, 3, 302, 1000, 444, 25, 10, 561, 41, 5, 5803, 37, 1623, 19, 4773, 2, 193, 1, 749, 88, 27, 1562, 19, 1861, 125, 11, 5542, 1963, 1317, 142, 25, 151, 4, 135, 357, 1765, 37, 29, 6989, 1232, 5095, 2344, 2, 6989, 132, 4179, 2344, 125, 10, 77, 248, 5, 34, 267, 734, 28, 98, 1, 497, 15, 6989, 2457, 1562, 10, 44, 41, 5, 20000, 5803, 15, 3117, 37, 4524, 4, 3, 1765, 31, 2821, 15, 3, 452, 31, 2821, 26, 160, 1902, 8, 926, 1, 458, 155, 2971, 6, 1282, 11429, 1765, 31, 3435, 1623, 4, 150, 5, 35, 1160, 7293, 1063, 497, 3, 904, 1, 5802, 13831, 1765, 37, 10, 149, 421, 2, 205, 44, 6178, 5, 2881, 15, 344, 3, 116, 1, 1562, 50, 1063, 1007, 497, 1480, 236, 3166, 489, 4, 33, 7, 28, 64, 43, 9, 34, 146, 26, 353, 16, 486, 195, 276, 4, 8, 124, 70, 215, 160, 5, 2581, 386, 2064, 1765, 37, 6, 344, 3, 1765, 31, 61, 5, 3, 461, 1, 1818, 429, 2, 1673, 3, 228, 1, 1063, 1007, 497, 9, 329, 1223]",2939.0,27090958,Haploidentical Natural Killer Infused Allogeneic Stem Transplantation Myeloid Malignancies Phase Trial,20,0.034904013961605584
miR-22 has a potent anti-tumour role with therapeutic potential in acute myeloid leukaemia.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2016-04-26,"MicroRNAs are subject to precise regulation and have key roles in tumorigenesis. In contrast to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated. Forced expression of miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC pathways. The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss. Furthermore, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo. Together, our study uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML, and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.",Journal Article,1365.0,56.0,MicroRNAs subject precise regulation key roles tumorigenesis contrast oncogenic role miR-22 reported myelodysplastic syndrome MDS breast miR-22 essential anti-tumour gatekeeper novo acute myeloid leukaemia AML significantly downregulated Forced expression miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic viability growth vitro substantially inhibits leukaemia development maintenance vivo Mechanistically miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes including CRTC1 FLT3 MYCBP represses CREB MYC pathways downregulation miR-22 AML caused TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss Furthermore nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression vivo uncovers TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit provides insights epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying pathogenesis AML highlights clinical potential miR-22-based AML therapy,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3515, 32, 2974, 6, 3260, 863, 2, 47, 825, 1790, 4, 1565, 4, 748, 6, 3, 1302, 200, 1, 722, 350, 210, 4, 681, 1223, 2, 12, 467, 21, 514, 17, 722, 350, 16, 35, 1452, 312, 770, 10899, 4, 1566, 2018, 286, 533, 2001, 329, 1257, 192, 16, 97, 3315, 5216, 55, 1, 722, 350, 97, 4079, 8871, 31, 2120, 2, 129, 4, 439, 2, 2109, 1576, 2001, 193, 2, 1146, 4, 386, 4187, 722, 350, 637, 232, 3326, 141, 16594, 1224, 2, 68055, 2, 631, 10946, 3, 8764, 2, 1371, 460, 3, 2475, 1, 722, 350, 4, 329, 16, 1546, 20, 20655, 39930, 3755, 21855, 517, 1418, 5255, 2, 15, 261, 1337, 207, 407, 798, 2889, 2934, 722, 350, 26256, 97, 1433, 2001, 91, 4, 386, 1162, 114, 45, 18562, 8, 20655, 39930, 3755, 21855, 722, 350, 8764, 1371, 3128, 14944, 2, 2267, 777, 1957, 237, 1418, 336, 483, 1181, 3, 1384, 1, 329, 2, 120, 2527, 3, 38, 174, 1, 722, 350, 90, 329, 36]",1086.0,27116251,miR-22 potent anti-tumour role therapeutic potential acute myeloid leukaemia,0,0.0
Whole-arm translocation of der(5;17)(p10;q10) with concurrent TP53 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): A unique molecular-cytogenetic subgroup.,Cancer genetics,Cancer Genet,2016-04-06,"Der(5;17)(p10;q10) is a recurrent but rare aberration reported in myeloid neoplasms (MNs). We report 48 such patients including 19 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 29 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), to characterize their clinicopathological features. There were 29 men and 19 women, with a median age of 61 years (range, 18-80). 62.5% patients had therapy-related diseases (t-MNs), 70.8% had multilineage dysplasia and 83.3% showed complex karyotypes. In 39 patients tested, FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT were all wild type and NRAS, KRAS, IDH1, APC, TET2 mutations were detected in single case(s) respectively. TP53 mutations were identified in 8 of 10 cases (80%) tested. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3 and 10 months, respectively and did not differ between AML or MDS cases, or between de novo versus therapy-related cases, or between the groups with or without complex karyotypes.

Fludarabine-Busulfan Reduced-Intensity Conditioning in Comparison with Fludarabine-Melphalan Is Associated with Increased Relapse Risk In Spite of Pharmacokinetic Dosing.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-05-07,"Fludarabine with busulfan (FB) and fludarabine with melphalan (FM) are commonly used reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. Pharmacokinetic dosing of busulfan (Bu) is frequently done for myeloablative conditioning, but evidence for its use is limited in RIC transplants. We compared transplant outcomes of FB versus FM using i.v. Bu targeted to the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 134 RIC transplants (47 FB and 87 FM) for acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome were identified, and median follow-up of the cohort was 40 months (range, 0 to 63.3). A significantly higher 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was associated with FB versus FM at 35.6% versus 17.3%, respectively (P = .0058). Furthermore, 2-year progression-free survival rates were higher for FM versus FB at 60.5% versus 48.7%, respectively (P = .04). However, 2-year rates of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were similar. The need for dose adjustment based on AUC did not alter relapse risk or NRM. Patients with Karnofsky performance status ≥ 90 who received FM had a 2-year OS rate of 74.8% versus 48.3% for FB (P = .03). FB use remained prognostic for relapse in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 5.89; P = .0097).

Evaluation of Patients and Families With Concern for Predispositions to Hematologic Malignancies Within the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC).,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2016-04-27,"Although multiple predispositions to hematologic malignancies exist, evaluations for hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) are underperformed by most hematologist/oncologists. Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported. From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients ≤ 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy. Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS, respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance. In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was confirmed in 12 patients (18%).

Pexmetinib: A Novel Dual Inhibitor of Tie2 and p38 MAPK with Efficacy in Preclinical Models of Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2016-06-10,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) suppress normal hematopoietic activity in part by enabling a pathogenic inflammatory milieu in the bone marrow. In this report, we show that elevation of angiopoietin-1 in myelodysplastic CD34(+) stem-like cells is associated with higher risk disease and reduced overall survival in MDS and AML patients. Increased angiopoietin-1 expression was associated with a transcriptomic signature similar to known MDS/AML stem-like cell profiles. In seeking a small-molecule inhibitor of this pathway, we discovered and validated pexmetinib (ARRY-614), an inhibitor of the angiopoietin-1 receptor Tie-2, which was also found to inhibit the proinflammatory kinase p38 MAPK (which is overactivated in MDS). Pexmetinib inhibited leukemic proliferation, prevented activation of downstream effector kinases, and abrogated the effects of TNFα on healthy hematopoietic stem cells. Notably, treatment of primary MDS specimens with this compound stimulated hematopoiesis. Our results provide preclinical proof of concept for pexmetinib as a Tie-2/p38 MAPK dual inhibitor applicable to the treatment of MDS/AML.

Time-dependent changes in mortality and transformation risk in MDS.,Blood,Blood,2016-06-22,"In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), the evolution of risk for disease progression or death has not been systematically investigated despite being crucial for correct interpretation of prognostic risk scores. In a multicenter retrospective study, we described changes in risk over time, the consequences for basal prognostic scores, and their potential clinical implications. Major MDS prognostic risk scoring systems and their constituent individual predictors were analyzed in 7212 primary untreated MDS patients from the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS database. Changes in risk of mortality and of leukemic transformation over time from diagnosis were described. Hazards regarding mortality and acute myeloid leukemia transformation diminished over time from diagnosis in higher-risk MDS patients, whereas they remained stable in lower-risk patients. After approximately 3.5 years, hazards in the separate risk groups became similar and were essentially equivalent after 5 years. This fact led to loss of prognostic power of different scoring systems considered, which was more pronounced for survival. Inclusion of age resulted in increased initial prognostic power for survival and less attenuation in hazards. If needed for practicability in clinical management, the differing development of risks suggested a reasonable division into lower- and higher-risk MDS based on the IPSS-R at a cutoff of 3.5 points. Our data regarding time-dependent performance of prognostic scores reflect the disparate change of risks in MDS subpopulations. Lower-risk patients at diagnosis remain lower risk whereas initially high-risk patients demonstrate decreasing risk over time. This change of risk should be considered in clinical decision making.",Journal Article,1308.0,46.0,myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs evolution risk disease progression death systematically investigated despite crucial correct interpretation prognostic risk scores multicenter retrospective described changes risk time consequences basal prognostic scores potential clinical implications Major MDS prognostic risk scoring systems constituent individual predictors 7212 primary untreated MDS patients International Working Group Prognosis MDS database Changes risk mortality leukemic transformation time diagnosis described Hazards mortality acute myeloid leukemia transformation diminished time diagnosis higher-risk MDS patients remained stable lower-risk patients approximately 3.5 years hazards separate risk groups similar essentially equivalent 5 years fact led loss prognostic power different scoring systems considered pronounced survival Inclusion age resulted increased initial prognostic power survival attenuation hazards needed practicability clinical management differing development risks suggested reasonable division lower- higher-risk MDS based IPSS-R cutoff 3.5 points time-dependent performance prognostic scores reflect disparate change risks MDS subpopulations Lower-risk patients diagnosis remain lower risk initially high-risk patients demonstrate decreasing risk time change risk considered clinical decision making,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 2040, 13550, 3, 2554, 1, 43, 9, 34, 91, 15, 273, 71, 44, 85, 3390, 565, 550, 486, 2653, 9, 4883, 3037, 1, 177, 43, 703, 4, 8, 1570, 459, 45, 21, 1027, 400, 4, 43, 252, 98, 3, 3255, 9, 2135, 177, 703, 2, 136, 174, 38, 1268, 458, 1223, 177, 43, 2504, 1530, 2, 136, 13832, 797, 674, 11, 311, 4, 68461, 86, 1278, 1223, 7, 29, 3, 944, 2644, 87, 9, 356, 4, 1223, 609, 400, 4, 43, 1, 282, 2, 1, 2015, 1392, 252, 98, 29, 147, 11, 1027, 1017, 666, 282, 2, 286, 533, 1392, 2849, 252, 98, 29, 147, 4, 142, 43, 1223, 7, 547, 491, 958, 585, 4, 280, 43, 7, 50, 705, 27, 33, 60, 1017, 4, 3, 2282, 43, 271, 3451, 288, 2, 11, 7257, 2017, 50, 33, 60, 26, 1991, 836, 6, 407, 1, 177, 2349, 1, 338, 2504, 1530, 515, 92, 10, 80, 3517, 9, 25, 1680, 1, 89, 627, 4, 101, 388, 177, 2349, 9, 25, 2, 299, 5349, 4, 1017, 492, 575, 9, 68462, 4, 38, 284, 3, 5276, 193, 1, 1098, 1148, 8, 3203, 5750, 237, 280, 2, 142, 43, 1223, 90, 23, 3, 8751, 668, 28, 8, 2779, 1, 27, 33, 862, 114, 74, 666, 98, 470, 528, 1, 177, 703, 2694, 3, 7985, 707, 1, 1098, 4, 1223, 4847, 280, 43, 7, 28, 147, 918, 280, 43, 547, 1625, 64, 43, 7, 608, 2777, 43, 252, 98, 26, 707, 1, 43, 257, 40, 515, 4, 38, 948, 1079]",1710.0,27335276,Time-dependent changes mortality transformation risk MDS,2,0.0034904013961605585
Long-Term Outcomes after Treatment with Clofarabine ± Fludarabine with Once-Daily Intravenous Busulfan as Pretransplant Conditioning Therapy for Advanced Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-07-01,"Pretransplant conditioning regimens critically determine outcomes in the setting of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The use of nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine (Flu) in combination with i.v. busulfan (Bu) has been shown to be highly effective as a pretransplant conditioning regimen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Because leukemia relapse remains the leading cause of death after allo-SCT, we studied whether clofarabine (Clo), a nucleoside analog with potent antileukemia activity, can be used to complement Flu. In a preliminary report, we previously showed the safety and efficacy of Clo ± Flu with i.v. Bu in 51 patients with high-risk AML, CML, and MDS. The study has now been completed, and we present long-term follow-up data on the entire 70-patient population, which included 49 (70%), 8 (11%), and 13 (19%) patients with AML, MDS, and CML, respectively. Thirteen patients (19%) were in complete remission, and 41 patients (59%) received matched unrelated donor grafts. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. Sixty-three patients (90%) achieved complete remission. There were no deaths reported at day +30, and the 100-day nonrelapse mortality rate was 4% (n = 3). Thirty-one percent of patients (n = 22) developed grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease, and the median overall survival and progression-free survival times were 2.4 years and .9 years, respectively.

Ipilimumab for Patients with Relapse after Allogeneic Transplantation.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2016-07-01,"Loss of donor-mediated immune antitumor activity after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) permits relapse of hematologic cancers. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint blockade established by targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 with ipilimumab could restore antitumor reactivity through a graft-versus-tumor effect. We conducted a phase 1/1b multicenter, investigator-initiated study to determine the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in patients with relapsed hematologic cancer after allogeneic HSCT. Patients received induction therapy with ipilimumab at a dose of 3 or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses, with additional doses every 12 weeks for up to 60 weeks in patients who had a clinical benefit. A total of 28 patients were enrolled. Immune-related adverse events, including one death, were observed in 6 patients (21%), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that precluded further administration of ipilimumab was observed in 4 patients (14%). No responses that met formal response criteria occurred in patients who received a dose of 3 mg per kilogram. Among 22 patients who received a dose of 10 mg per kilogram, 5 (23%) had a complete response, 2 (9%) had a partial response, and 6 (27%) had decreased tumor burden. Complete responses occurred in 4 patients with extramedullary acute myeloid leukemia and 1 patient with the myelodysplastic syndrome developing into acute myeloid leukemia. Four patients had a durable response for more than 1 year. Responses were associated with in situ infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, decreased activation of regulatory T cells, and expansion of subpopulations of effector T cells in the blood.

Acute erythroid leukemia with <20% bone marrow blasts is clinically and biologically similar to myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2016-07-15,"In acute erythroleukemia, erythroid/myeloid subtype, blasts usually comprise 5-19% of total bone marrow cells, similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome subtype refractory anemia with excess blasts; recent studies have raised the question if acute erythroleukemia should be considered as a myelodysplastic syndrome subtype. We reviewed 77 de novo acute erythroleukemia and 279 de novo refractory anemia with excess blasts from three large medical centers. Compared to refractory anemia with excess blasts, acute erythroleukemia patients had higher total bone marrow blasts, lower platelets, hemoglobin, and absolute neutrophil counts, with more patients being assigned a very-poor-karyotype risk and very-high Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score. Induction chemotherapy was administered to 55% of acute erythroleukemia patients, but was not associated with longer overall survival compared to acute erythroleukemia patients treated with lower-intensity therapies or supportive care (P=0.44). In multivariable analysis of all patients, Revised International Prognostic Scoring System very high (P<0.0001) or high (P=0.005) risk, but not a diagnosis of acute erythroleukemia (P=0.30), were independent risk factors for shorter overall survival. Our data show that acute erythroleukemia patients have similar risk-adjusted outcome to refractory anemia with excess blasts patients and do not appear to gain survival advantage with acute myeloid leukemia-type induction chemotherapy. These data suggest that acute erythroleukemia, erythroid/myeloid subtype with <20% blasts may be more appropriately classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts rather than as an acute myeloid leukemia subtype.",Journal Article,1285.0,16.0,acute erythroleukemia erythroid/myeloid subtype blasts usually comprise 5-19 total bone marrow similar myelodysplastic syndrome subtype refractory anemia excess blasts recent studies raised question acute erythroleukemia considered myelodysplastic syndrome subtype reviewed 77 novo acute erythroleukemia 279 novo refractory anemia excess blasts large medical centers Compared refractory anemia excess blasts acute erythroleukemia patients higher total bone marrow blasts lower platelets hemoglobin absolute neutrophil counts patients assigned very-poor-karyotype risk very-high Revised International Prognostic Scoring score Induction chemotherapy administered 55 acute erythroleukemia patients associated longer overall survival compared acute erythroleukemia patients treated lower-intensity therapies supportive care P=0.44 multivariable patients Revised International Prognostic Scoring high P 0.0001 high P=0.005 risk diagnosis acute erythroleukemia P=0.30 independent risk factors shorter overall survival acute erythroleukemia patients similar risk-adjusted outcome refractory anemia excess blasts patients appear gain survival advantage acute myeloid leukemia-type induction chemotherapy suggest acute erythroleukemia erythroid/myeloid subtype 20 blasts appropriately classified refractory anemia excess blasts acute myeloid leukemia subtype,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 286, 14661, 7839, 533, 875, 2438, 2082, 5238, 33, 326, 1, 181, 581, 37, 288, 6, 3, 681, 875, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 435, 94, 47, 5673, 3, 2840, 492, 286, 14661, 257, 40, 515, 22, 8, 681, 875, 21, 446, 849, 1566, 2018, 286, 14661, 2, 8562, 1566, 2018, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 29, 169, 375, 484, 1168, 72, 6, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 286, 14661, 7, 42, 142, 181, 581, 2438, 280, 4407, 2222, 2, 1766, 2595, 1911, 5, 80, 7, 486, 896, 8, 923, 334, 3385, 43, 2, 923, 64, 4218, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 368, 504, 56, 10, 468, 6, 614, 1, 286, 14661, 7, 84, 10, 44, 41, 5, 589, 63, 25, 72, 6, 286, 14661, 7, 73, 5, 280, 837, 235, 15, 1877, 165, 19, 13, 584, 4, 658, 65, 1, 62, 7, 4218, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 923, 64, 19, 13, 488, 15, 64, 19, 13, 1614, 43, 84, 44, 8, 147, 1, 286, 14661, 19, 13, 201, 11, 306, 43, 130, 9, 985, 63, 25, 114, 74, 514, 17, 286, 14661, 7, 47, 288, 43, 586, 228, 6, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 7, 2, 1022, 44, 1322, 6, 1803, 25, 1874, 5, 286, 533, 2647, 267, 504, 56, 46, 74, 309, 17, 286, 14661, 7839, 533, 875, 5, 179, 2438, 68, 40, 80, 4544, 1373, 22, 430, 1545, 5, 2612, 2438, 1832, 76, 22, 35, 286, 533, 875]",1627.0,27443511,Acute erythroid leukemia 20 bone marrow blasts clinically biologically similar myelodysplastic syndrome excess blasts,0,0.0
Targeting Splicing in the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Other Myeloid Neoplasms.,Current hematologic malignancy reports,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,2016-12-01,"Genome sequencing of primary cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) led to the identification of recurrent heterozygous mutations in gene encoding components of the spliceosome, the cellular machinery which processes pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) to mature mRNA during gene transcription. Splicing mutations are mutually exclusive with one another and collectively represent the most common mutation class in MDS, occurring in approximately 60 % of patients overall and more than 80 % of those with ring sideroblasts. Evidence from animal models suggests that homozygous splicing mutations are lethal, and that in heterozygously mutated models, any further disruption of splicing triggers apoptosis and cell death. MDS cells with spliceosome mutations are thus uniquely vulnerable to therapies targeting splicing, which may be tolerated by healthy cells. The spliceosome is emerging as a novel therapeutic target in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms, with the first clinical trial of a splicing modulator opening in 2016.",Journal Article,1146.0,8.0,Genome sequencing primary patients myelodysplastic syndromes MDS led identification recurrent heterozygous encoding components spliceosome cellular machinery processes pre-messenger RNA mRNA mature mRNA transcription Splicing mutually exclusive collectively represent common class MDS occurring approximately 60 patients overall 80 ring sideroblasts Evidence animal models suggests homozygous splicing lethal heterozygously models disruption splicing triggers apoptosis death MDS spliceosome uniquely vulnerable therapies targeting splicing tolerated healthy spliceosome emerging novel therapeutic target MDS related myeloid neoplasms clinical trial splicing modulator opening 2016,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[898, 615, 1, 86, 37, 29, 7, 5, 2040, 1223, 836, 6, 3, 911, 1, 387, 4167, 138, 4, 145, 2362, 1628, 1, 3, 13443, 3, 763, 6415, 92, 1849, 671, 5992, 893, 956, 6, 2908, 956, 190, 145, 866, 3895, 138, 32, 5575, 4804, 5, 104, 1809, 2, 2535, 1231, 3, 96, 186, 258, 1040, 4, 1223, 1821, 4, 705, 335, 1, 7, 63, 2, 80, 76, 493, 1, 135, 5, 4091, 23740, 241, 29, 2026, 274, 844, 17, 3189, 3895, 138, 32, 2266, 2, 17, 4, 49933, 1185, 274, 500, 195, 3220, 1, 3895, 5951, 351, 2, 31, 273, 1223, 37, 5, 13443, 138, 32, 631, 7089, 5017, 6, 235, 529, 3895, 92, 68, 40, 421, 20, 1331, 37, 3, 13443, 16, 1478, 22, 8, 229, 189, 283, 4, 1223, 2, 139, 533, 1179, 5, 3, 157, 38, 160, 1, 8, 3895, 6318, 11677, 4, 1390]",999.0,27492253,Targeting Splicing Treatment Myelodysplastic Syndromes Myeloid Neoplasms,182,0.31762652705061084

Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-31,"Purpose To characterize the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of selinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export, when combined with fludarabine and cytarabine, in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Patients and Methods Eighteen patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia were enrolled in the SELHEM (Selinexor With Fludarabine and Cytarabine for Treatment of Refractory or Relapsed Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome) clinical trial (NCT02212561). Selinexor, initially at 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per dose, was given orally on days 1, 3, 8, 10, 22, and 24 and was escalated according to a rolling-six design. Fludarabine 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and cytarabine 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> were administered on days 15 to 19. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed on days 1 and 22. Response evaluations were performed on day 15 and at the completion of course 1. Results Among the 17 patients who were evaluable for toxicity, three were treated at 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, three at 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, six at 55 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and five at 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was asymptomatic hyponatremia. Two patients who were treated at 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> experienced reversible cerebellar toxicity, thereby defining the dose-limiting toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameters demonstrated that plasma exposure was dose proportional. Fifteen of 16 patients demonstrated at least a twofold increase of XPO1 mRNA, indicating inhibition of the XPO1 protein. In this group of heavily pretreated, relapsed, and refractory patients, seven of 15 evaluable patients (47%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete count recovery.

Prognosis of Primary Myelofibrosis in the Genomic Era.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2016-08-01,"Currently, prognostication in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) relies on the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), dynamic IPSS (DIPSS), and DIPSS-plus, which incorporate age, blood counts, constitutional symptoms, circulating blasts, red cell transfusion need, and karyotype. Although the JAK2 V617F mutation was discovered a decade ago and MPL mutations shortly thereafter, it was the recent discovery of CALR mutations in the vast majority of JAK2/MPL-unmutated patients and recognition of the powerful impact of CALR mutations and triple-negative (JAK2/MPL/CALR-negative) status on outcome that set the stage for revision of traditional prognostic models to include molecular information. Additionally, the advent of next-generation sequencing has identified a host of previously unrecognized somatic mutations across hematologic malignancies. As in the myelodysplastic syndromes, the majority of common and prognostically informative mutations in PMF affect epigenetic regulation and mRNA splicing. Thus, a need has arisen to incorporate mutational information on genes such as ASXL1 and SRSF2 into risk stratification systems. Mutations in yet other genes appear to be important players in leukemic transformation, and new insights into disease pathogenesis are emerging. Finally, the number of prognostically detrimental mutations may affect both survival and response to ruxolitinib, which has significant implications for clinical decision making. In this review, we briefly summarize the prognostic models in use today and discuss in detail the somatic mutations commonly encountered in patients with PMF, along with their prognostic implications and role in leukemic transformation.

PDE4 Differential Expression Is a Potential Prognostic Factor and Therapeutic Target in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2016-08-01,"Inflammation has an essential role in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Its expression is controlled by phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Thus, PDE4 inhibitors might be useful therapeutic targets for MDS. We evaluated the expression of each isoform of PDE4 (A, B, C, and D) using transcriptomic profiling and examined the potential impact on the outcome of patients with MDS in terms of survival and response to hypomethylating agents. Total RNA was extracted from CD34(+) bone marrow hematopoietic cells from healthy individuals (n = 10) and patients with MDS (n = 24) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 19). The study cohort had a median follow-up period of 21.2 months (range, 0.2-68 months) and a median overall survival of 17.6 months (95% confidence interval, 9.6-25.6). The main finding of the present study was that PDE4 mean expression was generally higher in patients with MDS than in healthy individuals. Also, upregulated PDE4 expression seemed to have a possible negative effect on survival (P > .05). Moreover, lower, compared with higher, mean PDE4A and PDE4C expression is indicative of a response to a hypomethylating agent (0.09 and 0.03 vs. 0.54 and 0.49, respectively; P > .05). These results should be confirmed in a larger patient cohort.

"Connect MDS/AML: design of the myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia disease registry, a prospective observational cohort study.",BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2016-08-19,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are myeloid neoplasms in which outgrowth of neoplastic clones disrupts normal hematopoiesis. Some patients with unexplained persistent cytopenias may not meet minimal diagnostic criteria for MDS but an alternate diagnosis is not apparent; the term idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) has been used to describe this state. MDS and AML occur primarily in older patients who are often treated outside the clinical trial setting. Consequently, our understanding of the patterns of diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcomes of these patients is limited. Furthermore, there are few natural history studies of ICUS. To better understand how patients who have MDS, ICUS, or AML are managed in the routine clinical setting, the Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry, a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients newly diagnosed with these conditions has been initiated. The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will capture diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment, and outcomes data for approximately 1500 newly diagnosed patients from approximately 150 community and academic sites in the United States in 4 cohorts: (1) lower-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS] low and intermediate-1 risk), with and without del(5q); (2) higher-risk MDS (IPSS intermediate-2 and high risk); (3) ICUS; and (4) AML in patients aged ≥ 55 years (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia). Diagnosis will be confirmed by central review. Baseline patient characteristics, diagnostic patterns, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, health economics outcomes, and patient-reported health-related quality of life will be entered into an electronic data capture system at enrollment and quarterly for 8 years. A tissue substudy to explore the relationship between karyotypes, molecular markers, and clinical outcomes will be conducted, and is optional for patients. The Connect MDS/AML Disease Registry will be the first prospective, observational, non-interventional study in the United States to collect clinical information, patient-reported outcomes, and tissue samples from patients with MDS, ICUS, or AML receiving multiple therapies.

Med.,2016-09-07,"Precision medicine can be simply defined as the identification of personalized treatment that matches patient-specific clinical and genomic characteristics. Since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic makeup of diseases, especially cancers. The identification of somatic mutations that can drive cancer has led to the development of therapies that specifically target the abnormal proteins derived from these mutations. This has led to a paradigm shift in our treatment methodology. Although some success has been achieved in targeting some genetic abnormalities, several challenges and limitations exist when applying precision-medicine concepts in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Myelodysplastic Syndromes.,Journal of oncology practice,J Oncol Pract,2016-09-01,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers the only potential cure for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, with current approaches to HCT, many older patients with comorbidities are poor HCT candidates, and treatment-related morbidity and mortality may offset benefit for patients with lower-risk disease. Consequently, selection of patients with MDS for HCT should take into consideration disease risk category including mutational status, HCT comorbidity index, functional status, donor options, and available institutional resources. Formal geriatric assessment may further guide use of HCT and, if HCT is chosen, selection of conditioning intensity. Patients with higher-risk MDS should be considered for HCT at the time of diagnosis, whereas expectant nontransplant management is more appropriate for those with lower-risk disease. A high blast burden at the time of HCT increases the risk of subsequent relapse; however, the role of pretransplant cytoreductive therapy and the regimen of choice remain controversial. Patients with MDS younger than 65 years and with an HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 may benefit from more intense conditioning regimens. The presence of complex or monosomal karyotype or mutations in TP53, DNMT3A, or other genes identify patients with poorer outcomes following HCT. Patients with TP53 mutations have particularly poor survival, and should be enrolled in clinical trials whenever possible. Several important HCT studies are ongoing and will better define the role of HCT in MDS as well as the value of pretransplant cytoreductive therapy or post-transplant relapse-prevention strategies. Given the apparent underuse of HCT in eligible patients and low enrollment in MDS HCT clinical trials to date, timely referral of patients with MDS to such trials and HCT programs is critical.",Journal Article,1237.0,4.0,Allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation HCT offers potential cure patients myelodysplastic syndromes MDS current approaches HCT older patients comorbidities poor HCT candidates treatment-related morbidity mortality offset benefit patients lower-risk disease Consequently selection patients MDS HCT consideration disease risk category including status HCT comorbidity index functional status donor options available institutional resources Formal geriatric assessment guide use HCT HCT chosen selection conditioning intensity Patients higher-risk MDS considered HCT time diagnosis expectant nontransplant management appropriate lower-risk disease high blast burden time HCT increases risk subsequent relapse role pretransplant cytoreductive therapy regimen choice remain controversial Patients MDS younger 65 years HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 benefit intense conditioning regimens presence complex monosomal karyotype TP53 DNMT3A identify patients poorer outcomes following HCT Patients TP53 particularly poor survival enrolled clinical trials possible important HCT studies ongoing better define role HCT MDS value pretransplant cytoreductive therapy post-transplant relapse-prevention strategies Given apparent underuse HCT eligible patients low enrollment MDS HCT clinical trials date timely referral patients MDS trials HCT programs critical,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 2339, 3, 158, 174, 1722, 9, 7, 5, 2040, 1223, 137, 5, 291, 611, 6, 1085, 445, 434, 7, 5, 1909, 32, 334, 1085, 1931, 2, 24, 139, 787, 2, 282, 68, 9500, 247, 9, 7, 5, 280, 43, 34, 3244, 881, 1, 7, 5, 1223, 9, 1085, 257, 3585, 237, 2415, 34, 43, 2169, 141, 1619, 156, 1085, 1879, 558, 583, 156, 1488, 838, 2, 390, 1115, 2892, 5057, 3914, 455, 68, 195, 1597, 119, 1, 1085, 2, 492, 1085, 16, 4695, 881, 1, 1933, 837, 7, 5, 142, 43, 1223, 257, 40, 515, 9, 1085, 28, 3, 98, 1, 147, 547, 16351, 21364, 284, 16, 80, 870, 9, 135, 5, 280, 43, 34, 8, 64, 3112, 892, 28, 3, 98, 1, 1085, 1106, 3, 43, 1, 706, 429, 137, 3, 200, 1, 7763, 2604, 36, 2, 3, 477, 1, 1866, 918, 2010, 7, 5, 1223, 773, 76, 556, 60, 2, 5, 35, 1085, 1879, 558, 1552, 39, 68, 247, 29, 80, 3933, 1933, 472, 3, 463, 1, 840, 15, 22660, 3385, 15, 138, 4, 1206, 6199, 15, 127, 214, 255, 7, 5, 1769, 123, 366, 1085, 7, 5, 1206, 138, 47, 823, 334, 25, 2, 257, 40, 346, 4, 38, 143, 8395, 899, 392, 305, 1085, 94, 32, 942, 2, 303, 380, 1107, 3, 200, 1, 1085, 4, 1223, 22, 149, 22, 3, 549, 1, 7763, 2604, 36, 15, 539, 941, 429, 1070, 422, 447, 3, 2235, 10192, 1, 1085, 4, 625, 7, 2, 154, 1798, 4, 1223, 1085, 38, 143, 6, 1244, 4225, 2096, 1, 7, 5, 1223, 6, 225, 143, 2, 1085, 2251, 16, 740]",1801.0,27621329,Hematopoietic Transplantation Myelodysplastic Syndromes,142,0.24781849912739964
"The prognostic value of serum C-reactive protein, ferritin, and albumin prior to allogeneic transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.",Haematologica,Haematologica,2016-08-04,"We sought to confirm the prognostic importance of simple clinically available biomarkers of C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and ferritin prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The study population consisted of 784 adults with acute myeloid leukemia in remission or myelodysplastic syndromes undergoing unrelated donor transplant reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. C-reactive protein and ferritin were centrally quantified by ELISA from cryopreserved plasma whereas each center provided pre-transplant albumin. In multivariate analysis, transplant-related mortality was associated with the pre-specified thresholds of C-reactive protein more than 10 mg/L (P=0.008) and albumin less than 3.5 g/dL (P=0.01) but not ferritin more than 2500 ng/mL. Only low albumin independently influenced overall mortality.

When clinical heterogeneity exceeds genetic heterogeneity: thinking outside the genomic box in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-10-05,"Exome sequencing studies in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) illustrate a mutational landscape characterized by few somatic mutations involving a subset of recurrent gene mutations in ASXL1, SRSF2, and TET2, each approaching 40% in incidence. This has led to the clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing panels that effectively identify clonal monocytosis and complement clinical prognostic scoring systems in most patients. However, most murine models based on single gene mutations fail to recapitulate the CMML phenotype, and many gene mutations are loss of function, making the identification of traditional therapeutic vulnerabilities challenging. Further, as a subtype of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, CMML has a complex clinical heterogeneity not reflected by the mutational landscape. In this review, we will discuss the discordance between mutational homogeneity and clinical complexity and highlight novel genomic and nongenomic approaches that offer insight into the underlying clinical characteristics of CMML.",Journal Article,1203.0,21.0,Exome sequencing studies chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML illustrate landscape characterized somatic involving subset recurrent ASXL1 SRSF2 TET2 approaching 40 incidence led clinical implementation next-generation sequencing panels effectively identify clonal monocytosis complement clinical prognostic scoring systems patients murine models based single fail recapitulate CMML phenotype loss function making identification traditional therapeutic vulnerabilities challenging subtype myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms CMML complex clinical heterogeneity reflected landscape review discuss discordance homogeneity clinical complexity highlight novel genomic nongenomic approaches offer insight underlying clinical characteristics CMML,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2865, 615, 94, 4, 442, 5451, 3382, 4746, 8, 1619, 2801, 765, 20, 1021, 1119, 138, 1267, 8, 697, 1, 387, 145, 138, 4, 7782, 9830, 2, 5038, 296, 7773, 327, 4, 287, 26, 71, 836, 6, 3, 38, 2393, 1, 1305, 914, 615, 4383, 17, 1856, 255, 1946, 16875, 2, 3731, 38, 177, 2504, 1530, 4, 96, 7, 137, 96, 1471, 274, 90, 23, 226, 145, 138, 4373, 6, 7746, 3, 3382, 1005, 2, 445, 145, 138, 32, 407, 1, 343, 1079, 3, 911, 1, 1847, 189, 9614, 1950, 195, 22, 8, 875, 1, 3, 10589, 10857, 1179, 3382, 71, 8, 840, 38, 1144, 44, 4686, 20, 3, 1619, 2801, 4, 26, 206, 21, 303, 1139, 3, 5771, 59, 1619, 7502, 2, 38, 3082, 2, 1817, 229, 572, 2, 22042, 611, 17, 1918, 2670, 237, 3, 1181, 38, 374, 1, 3382]",1035.0,27707735,clinical heterogeneity exceeds genetic heterogeneity thinking outside genomic box chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,6,0.010471204188481676

This study evaluated the safety and activity of a combination of low-dose clofarabine and cytarabine for these patients. Seventy patients with higher-risk MDS who had no response, progressed, or relapsed after at least 4 cycles of HMA therapy were treated. The median age was 72 years. Thirty-nine percent of the patients had high-risk disease according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, and 50% of the patients had poor-risk cytogenetics. Twenty-three percent of the patients had therapy-related MDS. The median number of prior cycles of HMA was 6 (range, 4-45). The overall response rate was 44%. The 6-week mortality rate was 9%. Grade 3 and higher nonhematologic toxicities were rare, but infections occurred in 52% of the patients, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 33%. The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 1-37 months). Thirteen percent of the patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The responding patients had a median OS of 22 months, whereas the nonresponding patients had a median OS of 4 months. A complex karyotype was associated with worse response rates and OS.

KIR gene haplotype: an independent predictor of clinical outcome in MDS patients.,Blood,Blood,2016-10-19,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of hematopoietic disorders affecting the myeloid lineage, characterized by cytopenias and clonal evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that natural killer (NK) cells and their activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (aKIRs) influence the immune surveillance and clinical outcome of patients with MDSs. Here, we first examined the distribution of aKIR genes and haplotype in 2 independent cohorts of MDS and AML patients. The median number of aKIR genes was lower in MDS patients than healthy controls (2 vs 3 genes; P = .001), and lower in patients with secondary AML (progressed from MDSs) compared with de novo AML patients (2 vs 3; P = .008) and healthy controls (2 vs 3; P = .006). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of KIR haplotype A (characterized by low aKIR content 0-1) independently predicted a higher risk of conversion to AML (relative risk [RR] with 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67 [1.13-6.71]; P = .02) and worse adjusted progression-free survival (RR with 95% CI, 2.96 [1.59-5.52]; P = .001) and overall survival (2.25 [1.17-4.31]; P = .02), compared with KIR haplotype B (multiple aKIR genes).

[Expression of miR-550a-5p in Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Its Prediction of Target Genes].,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,2016-10-01,"To investigate the expression of miR-550a-5p in bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and to predict its target genes and function by bioinformatics analyses, so as to provide the evidence to furthre explore the role of miR-550a-5p and its target genes in pathogenesis of MDS. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-550a-5p in 54 MDS patients, 16 acute myeloid leukemia transformed from MDS (sfAML) and 19 healthy controls, and the correlation between the expression of miR-550a-5p and clinical pathologic characteristics of MDS, including chromosome, percentage of marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count and hemoglobin levels were analyzed. The sequence of miR-550 was searched in miRBase database. Target genes of miR-550a-5p were predicted by Microcosm,Miranda and Targetscan, and the predective results were collected, then the enrichment analyses of target gene function(GO) and signalling pathway(pathway of miR-550a-5p) were carried out by using gene ontology darabase and KEGG database. The expression of miR-550a-5p in bone marrow of all MDS patients was higher than that in controls: the expression level of miR-550a-5p in low risk MDS and middl risk 1 MDS was 1.7 times of controls (P=1.23×10<sup>-10</sup>); the expression of miR-550a-5p in midde risk 2 MDS and high risk MDS was 1.9 times of controls (P=1.20×10<sup>-10</sup>); the expression of miR-550a-5p in tAML was 2.0 times of controls (P=5.61×10<sup>-10</sup>). The miR-550a-5p expression level was up-regulated gradually with the enhancement of disease risk of MDS, but there was no correlation between the expression level of miR-550a-5p and clinical pathologic characteristics of MDS(chromosome: Normal: 1.11±0.19, Abnormal:1.26±0.15, P>0.05; Percentage of Marrow Blasts: r=0.29,P=0.07; absolute neutrophil count: r=-0.02,P=0.89; hemoglobin level: r=0.09,P=0.57; platelet count: r=0.25,P=0.08). The sequence of miR-550 was conservative among different species, and the prediced results indicated that there were 19 target genes in intersection.

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2016-10-24,"To evaluate the association between the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) and the recently developed age-adjusted HCT-CI (HCT-CI/age) and transplant outcomes in the setting of CD34-selected allogeneic HCT, we analyzed a homogeneous population of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT with CD34-selected grafts for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 346). Median HCT-CI and HCT-CI/age scores were 2 (percentile 25 to 75, 1 to 4) and 3 (percentile 25 to 75, 1 to 5), respectively. Higher HCT-CI and HCT-CI/age scores were associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and lower overall survival (OS). The HCT-CI distinguished 2 risk groups (0 to 2 versus ≥3), whereas, with the HCT-CI/age, there was a progressive increase in NRM and decrease in OS with increasing scores in all 4 groups (0 versus 1 to 2 versus 3 to 4 versus ≥5). Higher scores in both models were associated with lower chronic graft-versus-host disease relapse-free survival but not with higher relapse. Both models showed a promising predictive accuracy for NRM (c- = .616 for HCT-CI and c- = .647 for HCT-CI/age).

Haematol.,2016-10-28,"Limited therapies exist for patients with refractory and relapsed (RR) higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia with trilineage dysplasia (AML-TD). High dose (HD) lenalidomide (50 mg) has activity as frontline therapy in elderly AML but there is limited data in the RR setting. This phase II trial included patients with RR HR-MDS or AML-TD at 2 doses of lenalidomide (15 or 50 mg) on days 1-28 of 42-day cycles. The primary endpoint was response rate using the 2006 International Working Group criteria. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Of 27 patients enrolled, 59% had HR-MDS and 31% AML-TD. No patient had isolated del5q; 41% had poor-risk karyotype. Of 9 patients treated at 15 mg, 56% completed ≥2 cycles with no responses. Of 18 patients treated at 50 mg, 39% completed ≥2 cycles and 11% responded but all experienced grade 3/4 neutropenic fever/infection. The 60-day mortality rate was 30%. Median OS was 114 days with 19% surviving ≥1 year. The study was terminated due to lack of robust clinical activity. In conclusion, lenalidomide at 15 mg is ineffective in RR myeloid malignancies. Continous high dosing schedules are poorly tolerated and minimally active.

Current management of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2017-01-01,"The present review will focus on the current management of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as well as in future therapeutic perspectives. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative alterations in the bone marrow. Clinical behavior of the disease can be heterogeneous, with some patients having an indolent form of the disease, whereas others experience an aggressive course with decreased survival and eventual transformation to leukemia. Multiple studies have helped define the clinical, cytogenetic and mutational prognostic features of the disease. In addition, several prognostic scoring systems have been developed for patients with CMML. Incorporation of mutation data, particularly presence of frameshift and nonsense ASXL1 mutations, into these models seems to be allowing to further improve our ability to predict patient outcomes.

Risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome among older women receiving anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer on Modern Cooperative Group Trials (Alliance A151511).,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2016-11-19,"We examined acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) events among 9679 women treated for breast cancer on four adjuvant Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials with >90 months of follow-up in order to better characterize the risk for AML/MDS in older patients receiving anthracyclines. We used multivariable Cox regression to examine factors associated with AML/MDS, adjusting for age (≥65 vs. <65 years; separately for ≥70 vs. <70 years), race/ethnicity, insurance, performance status, and anthracycline receipt. We also examined the effect of cyclophosphamide, the interaction of anthracycline and age, and outcomes for those developing AML/MDS. On Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40101, 49907, 9344, and 9741, 7290 received anthracyclines; 15% were in the age ≥65 and 7% were ≥70. Overall, 47 patients developed AML/MDS (30 AML [0.3%], 17 MDS [0.2%]); 83% of events occurred within 5 years of study registration. Among those age ≥65 and ≥70, 0.8 and 1.0% developed AML/MDS (vs. 0.4% for age <65), respectively. In adjusted analyses, older age and anthracycline receipt were significantly associated with AML/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for age ≥65 [vs. <65] = 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-8.33; HR for anthracycline receipt [vs. no anthracycline] = 5.16, 95% CI 1.47-18.19). There was no interaction between age and anthracycline use. Deaths occurred in 70% of those developing AML/MDS.

Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia After Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.,The Prostate,Prostate,2016-11-21,"To understand the impact of radiotherapy on the development of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among elderly prostate cancer patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of elderly prostate cancer patients diagnosed during 1999-2011 by using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database. Competing risk analyses adjusting for patient characteristics were conducted to assess the impact of radiotherapy on the development of subsequent MDS/AML, compared with surgery. Of 32,112 prostate cancer patients, 14,672 underwent radiotherapy, and 17,440 received surgery only. The median follow-up was 4.68 years. A total of 157 (0.47%) prostate cancer patients developed subsequent MDS or AML, and the median time to develop MDS/AML was 3.30 (range: 0.16-9.48) years. Compared with prostate cancer patients who received surgery only, patients who underwent radiotherapy had a significantly increased risk of developing MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR] =1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.13). When radiotherapy was further categorized by modalities (brachytherapy, conventional conformal radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]), increased risk of second MDS/AML was only observed in the IMRT group (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.09-2.54). Our findings suggest that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of MDS/AML, and the impact may differ by modality. Additional studies with longer follow-up are needed to further clarify the role of radiotherapy in the development of subsequent myeloid malignancies. A better understanding may help patients, physicians, and other stakeholders make more informed treatment decisions.

New challenges in evaluating anemia in older persons in the era of molecular testing.,Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,2016-12-01,"Anemia is common in older persons, and often remains unexplained despite a thorough clinical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory testing, including marrow aspiration, biopsy, and karyotyping. The advent of molecular genetic testing panels in hematology clinical practice has complicated the evaluation of older patients with unexplained anemia. While the presence of a somatic mutation provides evidence of clonal hematopoiesis and may support a diagnosis of a hematologic neoplasm such as one of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), with rare exceptions, individual mutations are not strongly associated with one specific diagnosis, nor are they by themselves diagnostic of neoplasia. A clonal mutation in a patient with cytopenias and a nondiagnostic bone marrow may indicate a syndrome with a similar natural history to MDS, but at present there are no clear criteria to distinguish cytopenias coincidentally seen in association with an unrelated clonal mutation from cytopenias that are directly caused by that mutation.

TP53 and Decitabine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2016-11-01,"The molecular determinants of clinical responses to decitabine therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are unclear. We enrolled 84 adult patients with AML or MDS in a single-institution trial of decitabine to identify somatic mutations and their relationships to clinical responses. Decitabine was administered at a dose of 20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 10 consecutive days in monthly cycles. We performed enhanced exome or gene-panel sequencing in 67 of these patients and serial sequencing at multiple time points to evaluate patterns of mutation clearance in 54 patients. An extension cohort included 32 additional patients who received decitabine in different protocols. Of the 116 patients, 53 (46%) had bone marrow blast clearance (<5% blasts). Response rates were higher among patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile than among patients with an intermediate-risk or favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (29 of 43 patients [67%] vs. 24 of 71 patients [34%], P<0.001) and among patients with TP53 mutations than among patients with wild-type TP53 (21 of 21 [100%] vs. 32 of 78 [41%], P<0.001). Previous studies have consistently shown that patients with an unfavorable-risk cytogenetic profile and TP53 mutations who receive conventional chemotherapy have poor outcomes. However, in this study of 10-day courses of decitabine, neither of these risk factors was associated with a lower rate of overall survival than the rate of survival among study patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetic profiles. Patients with AML and MDS who had cytogenetic abnormalities associated with unfavorable risk, TP53 mutations, or both had favorable clinical responses and robust (but incomplete) mutation clearance after receiving serial 10-day courses of decitabine. Although these responses were not durable, they resulted in rates of overall survival that were similar to those among patients with AML who had an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and who also received serial 10-day courses of decitabine.

The role of p53 in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia: molecular aspects and clinical implications.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2016-12-14,"TP53 gene mutations occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with high-risk karyotypes including 17p abnormalities, monosomal and complex cytogenetics. TP53 mutations in these disorders portend rapid disease progression and resistance to conventional therapeutics. Notably, the size of the TP53 mutant clone as measured by mutation allele burden is directly linked to overall survival (OS) confirming the importance of p53 as a negative prognostic variable. In nucleolar stress-induced ribosomopathies, such as del(5q) MDS, disassociation of MDM2 and p53 results in p53 accumulation in erythroid precursors manifested as erythroid hypoplasia. P53 antagonism by lenalidomide or other therapeutics such as antisense oligonucleotides, repopulates erythroid precursors and enhances effective erythropoiesis. These findings demonstrate that p53 is an intriguing therapeutic target that is currently under investigation in MDS and AML. This study reviews molecular advances in understanding the role of p53 in MDS and AML, and explores potential therapeutic strategies in this era of personalized medicine.",Journal Article,1133.0,16.0,TP53 occurring patients myelodysplastic syndrome MDS acute myeloid leukemia AML associated high-risk karyotypes including 17p abnormalities monosomal complex cytogenetics TP53 disorders portend rapid disease progression resistance conventional therapeutics Notably size TP53 clone measured allele burden directly linked overall survival OS confirming importance p53 negative prognostic variable nucleolar stress-induced ribosomopathies del 5q MDS disassociation MDM2 p53 p53 accumulation erythroid precursors manifested erythroid hypoplasia P53 antagonism lenalidomide therapeutics antisense oligonucleotides repopulates erythroid precursors enhances effective erythropoiesis findings demonstrate p53 intriguing therapeutic target currently investigation MDS AML reviews molecular advances understanding role p53 MDS AML explores potential therapeutic strategies era personalized medicine,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1206, 145, 138, 1821, 4, 7, 5, 681, 1223, 2, 286, 533, 329, 32, 41, 5, 64, 43, 6809, 141, 4135, 1171, 22660, 2, 840, 2510, 1206, 138, 4, 46, 1997, 11293, 1321, 34, 91, 2, 251, 6, 809, 1943, 2552, 3, 444, 1, 3, 1206, 620, 3910, 22, 644, 20, 258, 1254, 892, 16, 1606, 1199, 6, 63, 25, 118, 5030, 3, 1187, 1, 624, 22, 8, 199, 177, 1347, 4, 11328, 1531, 277, 69477, 225, 22, 3084, 5460, 1223, 40579, 1, 3277, 2, 624, 99, 4, 624, 1835, 4, 7839, 4881, 6023, 22, 7839, 20991, 624, 7537, 20, 1288, 15, 127, 1943, 225, 22, 4645, 8721, 69478, 7839, 4881, 2, 2519, 323, 10297, 46, 272, 608, 17, 624, 16, 35, 9382, 189, 283, 17, 16, 694, 669, 940, 4, 1223, 2, 329, 26, 45, 2004, 219, 954, 4, 612, 3, 200, 1, 624, 4, 1223, 2, 329, 2, 6829, 174, 189, 422, 4, 26, 1713, 1, 2175, 1807]",1120.0,27967292,role p53 myelodysplastic syndromes acute myeloid leukemia molecular aspects clinical implications,13,0.02268760907504363
Dynamics of clonal evolution in myelodysplastic syndromes.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-12-19,"To elucidate differential roles of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we investigated clonal dynamics using whole-exome and/or targeted sequencing of 699 patients, of whom 122 were analyzed longitudinally. Including the results from previous reports, we assessed a total of 2,250 patients for mutational enrichment patterns. During progression, the number of mutations, their diversity and clone sizes increased, with alterations frequently present in dominant clones with or without their sweeping previous clones. Enriched in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML; in comparison to high-risk MDS), FLT3, PTPN11, WT1, IDH1, NPM1, IDH2 and NRAS mutations (type 1) tended to be newly acquired, and were associated with faster sAML progression and a shorter overall survival time. Significantly enriched in high-risk MDS (in comparison to low-risk MDS), TP53, GATA2, KRAS, RUNX1, STAG2, ASXL1, ZRSR2 and TET2 mutations (type 2) had a weaker impact on sAML progression and overall survival than type-1 mutations.

Immunol.,2016-12-26,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation contributes to premalignant hematologic conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). TRAF6, a TLR effector with ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity, is overexpressed in MDS hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that TRAF6 overexpression in mouse HSPC results in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. Using a global Ub screen, we identified hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein and auxiliary splicing factor, as a substrate of TRAF6. TRAF6 ubiquitination of hnRNPA1 regulated alternative splicing of Arhgap1, which resulted in activation of the GTP-binding Rho family protein Cdc42 and accounted for hematopoietic defects in TRAF6-expressing HSPCs.

Clonal Hematopoiesis Associated With Adverse Outcomes After Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation for Lymphoma.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-01-09,"Purpose Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition characterized by somatic mutations in the blood of otherwise healthy adults. We hypothesized that in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of ASCT would be associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, collectively termed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (TMN), and other adverse outcomes. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing on pre- and post-ASCT samples from 12 patients who developed TMN after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma and targeted sequencing on cryopreserved aliquots of autologous stem-cell products from 401 patients who underwent ASCT for non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2003 and 2010. We assessed the effect of CHIP at the time of ASCT on subsequent outcomes, including TMN, cause-specific mortality, and overall survival. Results For six of 12 patients in the exome sequencing cohort, mutations found in the TMN specimen were also detectable in the pre-ASCT specimen. In the targeted sequencing cohort, 120 patients (29.9%) had CHIP at the time of ASCT, which was associated with an increased rate of TMN (10-year cumulative incidence, 14.1% v 4.3% for those with and without CHIP, respectively; P = .002). Patients with CHIP had significantly inferior overall survival compared with those without CHIP (10-year overall survival, 30.4% v 60.9%, respectively; P < .001), including increased risk of death from TMN and cardiovascular disease.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MDS and CMML: recommendations from an international expert panel.,Blood,Blood,2017-01-17,"An international expert panel, active within the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, European LeukemiaNet, Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Group, and the International Myelodysplastic Syndromes Foundation developed recommendations for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Disease risks scored according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and presence of comorbidity graded according to the HCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) were recognized as relevant clinical variables for HSCT eligibility. Fit patients with higher-risk IPSS-R and those with lower-risk IPSS-R with poor-risk genetic features, profound cytopenias, and high transfusion burden are candidates for HSCT. Patients with a very high MDS transplantation risk score, based on combination of advanced age, high HCT-CI, very poor-risk cytogenetic and molecular features, and high IPSS-R score have a low chance of cure with standard HSCT and consideration should be given to treating these patients in investigational studies. Cytoreductive therapy prior to HSCT is advised for patients with ≥10% bone marrow myeloblasts. Evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials does not provide support for specific recommendations on the optimal high intensity conditioning regimen. For patients with contraindications to high-intensity preparative regimens, reduced intensity conditioning should be considered. Optimal timing of HSCT requires careful evaluation of the available effective nontransplant strategies. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) strategies are recommended in patients at high risk of relapse after HSCT. Immune modulation by DLI strategies or second HSCT is advised if relapse occurs beyond 6 months after HSCT.",Journal Article,1099.0,66.0,international expert panel active European Society Blood Marrow Transplantation European LeukemiaNet Blood Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Group International Myelodysplastic Syndromes Foundation developed recommendations allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation HSCT myelodysplastic syndromes MDS chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML Disease risks scored according revised International Prognostic Scoring IPSS-R presence comorbidity graded according HCT Comorbidity Index HCT-CI recognized relevant clinical variables HSCT eligibility Fit patients higher-risk IPSS-R lower-risk IPSS-R poor-risk genetic features profound cytopenias high transfusion burden candidates HSCT Patients high MDS transplantation risk score based combination advanced age high HCT-CI poor-risk cytogenetic molecular features high IPSS-R score low chance cure standard HSCT consideration given treating patients investigational studies Cytoreductive therapy prior HSCT advised patients ≥10 bone marrow myeloblasts Evidence prospective randomized clinical trials provide support specific recommendations optimal high intensity conditioning regimen patients contraindications high-intensity preparative regimens reduced intensity conditioning considered Optimal timing HSCT requires careful evaluation available effective nontransplant strategies Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion DLI strategies recommended patients high risk relapse HSCT Immune modulation DLI strategies second HSCT advised relapse occurs 6 months HSCT,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[35, 944, 2005, 993, 544, 262, 3, 1865, 1174, 9, 315, 2, 581, 497, 1865, 10631, 315, 2, 581, 941, 38, 160, 87, 2, 3, 944, 2040, 3247, 276, 883, 9, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 497, 1703, 4, 2040, 1223, 2, 442, 5451, 3382, 34, 1098, 3179, 768, 6, 3, 4218, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 8751, 668, 2, 463, 1, 1879, 3468, 768, 6, 3, 1085, 1879, 558, 1085, 58, 11, 1904, 22, 867, 38, 682, 9, 1703, 2317, 2975, 7, 5, 142, 43, 8751, 668, 2, 135, 5, 280, 43, 8751, 668, 5, 334, 43, 336, 404, 4399, 5635, 2, 64, 2785, 892, 32, 1931, 9, 1703, 7, 5, 8, 923, 64, 1223, 497, 43, 368, 90, 23, 150, 1, 131, 89, 64, 1085, 58, 923, 334, 43, 1266, 2, 219, 404, 2, 64, 8751, 668, 368, 47, 8, 154, 3477, 1, 1722, 5, 260, 1703, 2, 2415, 257, 40, 447, 6, 1367, 46, 7, 4, 3093, 94, 2604, 36, 324, 6, 1703, 16, 9624, 9, 7, 5, 4556, 581, 14909, 241, 29, 482, 384, 38, 143, 1097, 44, 377, 538, 9, 112, 883, 23, 3, 665, 64, 837, 1933, 477, 9, 7, 5, 8511, 6, 64, 837, 6085, 472, 405, 837, 1933, 257, 40, 515, 665, 1972, 1, 1703, 1706, 3465, 451, 1, 3, 390, 323, 21364, 422, 1862, 1488, 1448, 904, 4676, 422, 32, 793, 4, 7, 28, 64, 43, 1, 429, 50, 1703, 250, 2356, 20, 4676, 422, 15, 419, 1703, 16, 9624, 492, 429, 1780, 1654, 49, 53, 50, 1703]",1776.0,28096091,Allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation MDS CMML recommendations international expert panel,3,0.005235602094240838

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-01-17,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning regimen intensity has varied for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. A comparative effectiveness analysis was performed to assess outcomes of busulfan and fludarabine (BuFlu) versus those of fludarabine and 400 cGy total body irradiation (FluTBI) conditioning. Thirty-three subjects received BuFlu and 38 received FluTBI. The BuFlu group received more red blood cell transfusions (P = .02) and had a longer time to platelet recovery (P = .004).

Association of Therapy for Autoimmune Disease With Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2017-07-01,"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are a potentially life-threatening consequence of treatment for autoimmune disease (AID) and an emerging clinical phenomenon. To query the association of cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating agents to treat patients with AID with the risk for developing myeloid neoplasm. This retrospective case-control study and medical record review included 40 011 patients with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, coded diagnosis of primary AID who were seen at 2 centers from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014; of these, 311 patients had a concomitant coded diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Eighty-six cases met strict inclusion criteria. A case-control match was performed at a 2:1 ratio. Odds ratio (OR) assessment for AID-directed therapies. Among the 86 patients who met inclusion criteria (49 men [57%]; 37 women [43%]; mean [SD] age, 72.3 [15.6] years), 55 (64.0%) had MDS, 21 (24.4%) had de novo AML, and 10 (11.6%) had AML and a history of MDS. Rheumatoid arthritis (23 [26.7%]), psoriasis (18 [20.9%]), and systemic lupus erythematosus (12 [14.0%]) were the most common autoimmune profiles. Median time from onset of AID to diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm was 8 (interquartile range, 4-15) years. A total of 57 of 86 cases (66.3%) received a cytotoxic or an immunomodulating agent. In the comparison group of 172 controls (98 men [57.0%]; 74 women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [13.8] years), 105 (61.0%) received either agent (P = .50). Azathioprine sodium use was observed more frequently in cases (odds ratio [OR], 7.05; 95% CI, 2.35- 21.13; P < .001). Notable but insignificant case cohort use among cytotoxic agents was found for exposure to cyclophosphamide (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 0.91-14.11) followed by mitoxantrone hydrochloride (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 0.23-33.0). Methotrexate sodium (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29-1.22), mercaptopurine (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.15-2.53), and mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.21-2.03) had favorable ORs that were not statistically significant. No significant association between a specific length of time of exposure to an agent and the drug's category was observed. In a large population with primary AID, azathioprine exposure was associated with a 7-fold risk for myeloid neoplasm. The control and case cohorts had similar systemic exposures by agent category. No association was found for anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. Finally, no timeline was found for the association of drug exposure with the incidence in development of myeloid neoplasm.",Journal Article,934.0,26.0,Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms potentially life-threatening consequence treatment autoimmune disease AID emerging clinical phenomenon query association cytotoxic anti-inflammatory immunomodulating agents treat patients AID risk developing myeloid neoplasm retrospective case-control medical record review included 40 011 patients International Classification Diseases Ninth Revision coded diagnosis primary AID seen 2 centers January 1 2004 December 31 2014 311 patients concomitant coded diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome MDS acute myeloid leukemia AML Eighty-six cases met strict inclusion criteria case-control match performed 2:1 ratio Odds ratio assessment AID-directed therapies 86 patients met inclusion criteria 49 men 57 37 women 43 mean SD age 72.3 15.6 years 55 64.0 MDS 21 24.4 novo AML 10 11.6 AML history MDS Rheumatoid arthritis 23 26.7 psoriasis 18 20.9 systemic lupus erythematosus 12 14.0 common autoimmune profiles Median time onset AID diagnosis myeloid neoplasm 8 interquartile range 4-15 years total 57 86 cases 66.3 received cytotoxic immunomodulating agent comparison group 172 controls 98 men 57.0 74 women 43.0 mean SD age 72.7 13.8 years 105 61.0 received agent P .50 Azathioprine sodium use observed frequently cases odds ratio 7.05 95 CI 2.35- 21.13 P .001 Notable insignificant case cohort use cytotoxic agents exposure cyclophosphamide 3.58 95 CI 0.91-14.11 followed mitoxantrone hydrochloride 2.73 95 CI 0.23-33.0 Methotrexate sodium 0.60 95 CI 0.29-1.22 mercaptopurine 0.62 95 CI 0.15-2.53 mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride 0.66 95 CI 0.21-2.03 favorable ORs statistically significant significant association specific length time exposure agent drug 's category observed large population primary AID azathioprine exposure associated 7-fold risk myeloid neoplasm control case cohorts similar systemic exposures agent category association anti-tumor necrosis factor agents Finally timeline association drug exposure incidence development myeloid neoplasm,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[36, 139, 533, 1179, 32, 8, 751, 358, 3691, 4177, 1, 24, 9, 3445, 34, 2427, 2, 35, 1478, 38, 3936, 6, 12259, 3, 248, 1, 759, 312, 1291, 2, 13861, 183, 6, 943, 7, 5, 2427, 5, 3, 43, 9, 931, 533, 2131, 26, 459, 473, 182, 45, 2, 484, 3237, 206, 159, 327, 3651, 7, 5, 35, 944, 947, 1, 1342, 13544, 5646, 8259, 147, 1, 86, 2427, 54, 11, 527, 28, 18, 1168, 29, 1024, 14, 1131, 6, 1397, 456, 1409, 1, 46, 9521, 7, 42, 8, 1781, 8259, 147, 1, 681, 1223, 15, 286, 533, 329, 2207, 437, 140, 543, 8043, 1680, 371, 8, 473, 182, 5364, 10, 173, 28, 8, 18, 14, 197, 610, 197, 15, 455, 9, 2427, 1166, 235, 107, 3, 868, 7, 54, 543, 1680, 371, 739, 325, 696, 567, 117, 601, 313, 1270, 89, 720, 27, 167, 49, 60, 614, 660, 13, 42, 1223, 239, 259, 39, 42, 1566, 2018, 329, 2, 79, 175, 49, 42, 329, 2, 8, 532, 1, 1223, 12269, 8646, 382, 432, 67, 14648, 203, 179, 83, 2, 403, 15966, 21228, 133, 213, 13, 11, 3, 96, 186, 3445, 1241, 52, 98, 29, 1707, 1, 2427, 6, 147, 1, 533, 2131, 10, 66, 2899, 184, 39, 167, 60, 8, 181, 1, 696, 1, 868, 140, 700, 27, 103, 8, 759, 15, 35, 13861, 420, 4, 3, 1155, 87, 1, 5312, 535, 1096, 325, 696, 13, 794, 117, 601, 13, 313, 1270, 89, 720, 67, 233, 66, 60, 3263, 713, 13, 103, 361, 420, 19, 212, 18744, 4682, 119, 10, 164, 80, 746, 4, 140, 610, 197, 15, 67, 474, 48, 58, 18, 465, 239, 233, 19, 144, 4090, 84, 6761, 473, 180, 119, 107, 759, 183, 10, 204, 9, 645, 6, 1112, 15, 27, 717, 48, 58, 13, 970, 213, 175, 370, 20, 4419, 12268, 15, 18, 803, 48, 58, 13, 382, 466, 13, 2116, 4682, 15, 13, 335, 48, 58, 13, 462, 14, 350, 9223, 15, 13, 744, 48, 58, 13, 167, 18, 699, 2, 11902, 13246, 12268, 15, 13, 700, 48, 58, 13, 239, 18, 680, 42, 913, 3694, 17, 11, 44, 712, 93, 77, 93, 248, 59, 8, 112, 1318, 1, 98, 1, 645, 6, 35, 420, 2, 3, 234, 292, 2169, 10, 164, 4, 8, 375, 266, 5, 86, 2427, 18744, 645, 10, 41, 5, 8, 67, 1116, 43, 9, 533, 2131, 3, 182, 2, 473, 736, 42, 288, 403, 3401, 20, 420, 2169, 77, 248, 10, 204, 9, 312, 30, 1523, 161, 183, 1368, 77, 21670, 10, 204, 9, 3, 248, 1, 234, 645, 5, 3, 287, 4, 193, 1, 533, 2131]",2435.0,28152123,Association Therapy Autoimmune Disease Myelodysplastic Syndromes Acute Myeloid Leukemia,261,0.45549738219895286
Patient age and number of apheresis days may predict development of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for lymphoma.,Transfusion,Transfusion,2017-02-10,"The goal of our study was to find predictors for the development of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelogenous leukemia (s-MDS/AML) in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma who received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). We conducted a retrospective review of 295 patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma who had undergone their first stem cell collection and ASCT. Patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were collected. The primary goal of this study was to analyze the association between the number of apheresis days needed to collect the requisite stem cell dose in addition to the previously described factors such as age, sex, number and type of prior chemotherapeutic regimens, disease type and status, and the risk of developing s-MDS/AML. Twenty-two patients of 295 were diagnosed with s-MDS/AML after a median follow-up of 62 months. Multivariate analysis using a classification and regression tree showed that the incidence of s-MDS/AML was lowest in patients who were not more than 55 years old at transplantation and in whom the target cell dose was collected in fewer than two apheresis sessions (5-year cumulative incidence, 1%), whereas incidence was highest in patients who were more than 55 years old at transplantation and who received a transplant more than 21 months after their initial lymphoma diagnosis (5-year cumulative incidence, 20%).

Genetic abnormalities in myelodysplasia and secondary acute myeloid leukemia: impact on outcome of stem cell transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2017-02-21,"Genetic alterations, including mutations and copy-number alterations, are central to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes and related diseases (myelodysplasia), but their roles in allogeneic stem cell transplantation have not fully been studied in a large cohort of patients. We enrolled 797 patients who had been diagnosed with myelodysplasia at initial presentation and received transplantation via the Japan Marrow Donor Program. Targeted-capture sequencing was performed to identify mutations in 69 genes, together with copy-number alterations, whose effects on transplantation outcomes were investigated. We identified 1776 mutations and 927 abnormal copy segments among 617 patients (77.4%). In multivariate modeling using Cox proportional-hazards regression, genetic factors explained 30% of the total hazards for overall survival; clinical characteristics accounted for 70% of risk. <i>TP53</i> and RAS-pathway mutations, together with complex karyotype (CK) as detected by conventional cytogenetics and/or sequencing-based analysis, negatively affected posttransplant survival independently of clinical factors. Regardless of disease subtype, <i>TP53</i>-mutated patients with CK were characterized by unique genetic features and associated with an extremely poor survival with frequent early relapse, whereas outcomes were substantially better in <i>TP53</i>-mutated patients without CK. By contrast, the effects of RAS-pathway mutations depended on disease subtype and were confined to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs).

Relation between chelation and clinical outcomes in lower-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes: Registry analysis at 5 years.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2017-01-31,"Prospective data are needed to ascertain the impact of iron chelation therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The present 5-year prospective registry analysis was conducted to compare clinical outcomes between chelated and nonchelated patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and transfusional iron overload. In an interim analysis at 24 months, we previously reported that chelation therapy was associated with longer median overall survival and a tendency toward longer leukemia-free survival and fewer cardiac events. In the present report, we detail findings from the final analysis at 5 years. We confirm, at the conclusion of this 5-year, prospective, non-interventional study, that overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received iron chelation therapy vs those who did not. Causes of death in the overall population were predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia followed by cardiac disease. Time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia was also significantly longer in patients receiving chelation therapy, and significantly fewer patients progressed to leukemia vs those not receiving chelation therapy. Limitations of the study include a potential for clinical bias, as patients with longer predicted survival may have been chosen for chelation therapy, the differences present in concomitant conditions at baseline, and the possibility that some high-risk patients were not identified due to limited cytogenetic classification.",Journal Article,1085.0,16.0,Prospective needed ascertain impact iron chelation therapy patients myelodysplastic syndromes present 5-year prospective registry conducted compare clinical outcomes chelated nonchelated patients lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes transfusional iron overload interim 24 months previously reported chelation therapy associated longer median overall survival tendency longer leukemia-free survival fewer cardiac events present report findings final 5 years confirm 5-year prospective non-interventional overall survival significantly longer patients received iron chelation therapy vs Causes death overall population predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia followed cardiac disease Time progression acute myeloid leukemia significantly longer patients receiving chelation therapy significantly fewer patients progressed leukemia vs receiving chelation therapy Limitations include potential clinical bias patients longer predicted survival chosen chelation therapy differences present concomitant conditions baseline possibility high-risk patients identified limited cytogenetic classification,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"[482, 74, 32, 575, 6, 6040, 3, 345, 1, 4231, 19709, 36, 4, 7, 5, 2040, 3, 364, 33, 111, 482, 1608, 65, 10, 426, 6, 932, 38, 123, 59, 30470, 2, 69964, 7, 5, 280, 43, 2040, 2, 27843, 4231, 13143, 4, 35, 2914, 65, 28, 259, 53, 21, 373, 210, 17, 19709, 36, 10, 41, 5, 589, 52, 63, 25, 2, 8, 7135, 1317, 589, 2647, 115, 25, 2, 1497, 281, 4, 3, 364, 414, 21, 5000, 272, 29, 3, 1457, 65, 28, 33, 60, 21, 1843, 28, 3, 1221, 1, 26, 33, 111, 482, 220, 6182, 45, 17, 63, 25, 10, 97, 589, 4, 7, 54, 103, 4231, 19709, 36, 105, 135, 54, 205, 44, 1626, 1, 273, 4, 3, 63, 266, 11, 2117, 2040, 286, 533, 370, 20, 34, 98, 6, 91, 6, 286, 533, 10, 120, 97, 589, 4, 7, 357, 19709, 36, 2, 97, 1497, 7, 1839, 6, 105, 135, 44, 357, 19709, 36, 1939, 1, 3, 45, 643, 8, 174, 9, 38, 2947, 22, 7, 5, 589, 783, 25, 68, 47, 85, 4695, 9, 19709, 36, 3, 362, 364, 4, 1781, 1298, 28, 330, 2, 3, 2526, 17, 476, 64, 43, 7, 11, 44, 108, 520, 6, 383, 1266, 947]",1393.0,28242540,Relation chelation clinical outcomes lower-risk patients myelodysplastic syndromes Registry 5 years,0,0.0
Assessment of Drug Sensitivity in Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells from Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome Ex Vivo.,Stem cells translational medicine,Stem Cells Transl Med,2016-11-07,"Current understanding suggests that malignant stem and progenitor cells must be reduced or eliminated for prolonged remissions in myeloid neoplasms such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Multicolor flow cytometry has been widely used to distinguish stem and myeloid progenitor cells from other populations in normal and malignant bone marrow. In this study, we present a method for assessing drug sensitivity in MDS and AML patient hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cell populations ex vivo using the investigational Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 and standard-of-care agent cytarabine as examples. Utilizing a multicolor flow cytometry antibody panel for identification of hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors present in mononuclear cell fractions isolated from bone marrow aspirates, we compare stem and progenitor cell counts after treatment for 24 hours with drug versus diluent. We demonstrate that MLN4924 exerts a cytotoxic effect on MDS and AML stem and progenitor cell populations, whereas cytarabine has more limited effects. Further application of this method for evaluating drug effects on these populations ex vivo and in vivo may inform rational design and selection of therapies in the clinical setting.

Cytogenetics and comorbidity predict outcomes in older myelodysplastic syndrome patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation using reduced intensity conditioning.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-03-21,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only treatment with a curative potential for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Allo-HSCT has substantial risks, particularly in the elderly, and its role for older MDS patients has yet to be defined. We analyzed 88 MDS patients aged ≥ 60 years with allo-HSCT after reduced intensity conditioning regimens over the last decade. The study cohort had high risk features; 47 of 88 (53.4%) patients were > 65 years of age, 24 (27%) patients had cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with monosomal karyotype (MKpos), 33 (38%) patients had histological subtype of RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 at diagnosis, and 45 (51%) patients had a hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) of ≥ 3. The 3-year incidence of progression, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall survival (OS) were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-37%), 35% (95% CI, 26%-47%), and 41% (95% CI, 30%-52%), respectively. MKpos was the only prognostic factor that increased the risk of disease progression compared with good-risk cytogenetics (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.5, P = .003) as well as MKneg (HR = 3.3, P = .01). For TRM, HCT-CI ≥ 3, but not age >65 years, was associated with worse outcomes (HR = 3.1, P = .007). Cytogenetics and HCT-CI enabled us to identify prognostic groups for OS. MKpos patients had the worst 3-year OS (17%), whereas patients with good-risk cytogenetics and HCT-CI < 3 had the best OS (92%).

Patients were randomized to 6-8 cycles of FND followed by 6 monthly doses of rituximab or 6 doses of rituximab given concurrently with FND. All patients who achieved at least a partial response received 12 months of interferon (IFN) maintenance. Median ages were 54 and 55 years. The two groups were comparable with the exception of a higher percentage of females (65% vs. 43%) and baseline anaemia (23% vs. 11%) in the FND followed by rituximab group. Complete response/unconfirmed complete response rates were 89% and 93%. The most frequent grade ≥ 3 toxicity was neutropenia (86% vs. 96%). Neutropenic fever occurred in 21% and 16%.

Outcome of Lower-Risk Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Without 5q Deletion After Failure of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-03-28,"Purpose Most anemic patients with non-deleted 5q lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), with a response rate of approximately 50%. Second-line treatments, including hypomethylating agents (HMAs), lenalidomide (LEN), and investigational drugs, may be used after ESA failure in some countries, but their effect on disease progression and overall survival (OS) is unknown. Here, we analyzed outcome after ESA failure and the effect of second-line treatments. Patients and Methods We examined an international retrospective cohort of 1,698 patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs. Results Erythroid response to ESAs was 61.5%, and median response duration was 17 months. Of 1,147 patients experiencing ESA failure, 653 experienced primary failure and 494 experienced relapse after a response. Primary failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, which did not translate into an OS difference. Of 450 patients (39%) who received second-line treatment, 194 received HMAs, 148 received LEN, and 108 received other treatments (MISC), whereas 697 received RBC transfusions only. Five-year AML cumulative incidence was 20.3%, 20.3%, and 11.3% for those receiving HMAs, LEN, and MISC, respectively ( P = .05). Five-year OS for patients receiving HMA, LEN, and MISC was 36.5%, 41.7%, and 51%, respectively ( P = .21). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and progression at ESA failure, there was no significant OS difference among the three groups. Conclusion In this large, multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs, none of the most commonly used second-line treatments (HMA and LEN) significantly improved OS. Early failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of AML progression.",Journal Article,1029.0,26.0,"Purpose anemic patients non-deleted 5q lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes MDS treated erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ESAs response rate approximately 50 Second-line treatments including hypomethylating agents HMAs lenalidomide LEN investigational drugs ESA failure countries effect disease progression overall survival OS unknown outcome ESA failure effect second-line treatments Patients Methods examined international retrospective cohort 1,698 patients non-del 5q lower-risk MDS treated ESAs Erythroid response ESAs 61.5 median response duration 17 months 1,147 patients experiencing ESA failure 653 experienced primary failure 494 experienced relapse response Primary failure ESAs associated higher risk acute myeloid leukemia AML progression translate OS difference 450 patients 39 received second-line treatment 194 received HMAs 148 received LEN 108 received treatments MISC 697 received RBC transfusions Five-year AML cumulative incidence 20.3 20.3 11.3 receiving HMAs LEN MISC respectively P .05 Five-year OS patients receiving HMA LEN MISC 36.5 41.7 51 respectively P .21 multivariable adjusted age sex revised International Prognostic Scoring score progression ESA failure significant OS difference groups large multicenter retrospective cohort patients non-del 5q lower-risk MDS treated ESAs commonly second-line treatments HMA LEN significantly improved OS Early failure ESAs associated higher risk AML progression",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 96, 16224, 7, 5, 220, 4389, 5460, 280, 43, 2040, 1223, 32, 73, 5, 10297, 2122, 183, 3243, 5, 8, 51, 116, 1, 705, 212, 419, 328, 640, 141, 4931, 183, 12688, 1288, 6841, 2, 3093, 600, 68, 40, 95, 50, 13413, 496, 4, 476, 2115, 84, 136, 254, 23, 34, 91, 2, 63, 25, 118, 16, 860, 467, 21, 311, 228, 50, 13413, 496, 2, 3, 254, 1, 419, 328, 640, 7, 2, 636, 21, 409, 35, 944, 459, 180, 1, 14, 14072, 7, 5, 220, 3084, 5460, 280, 43, 1223, 73, 5, 3243, 99, 7839, 51, 6, 3243, 10, 713, 33, 2, 52, 51, 654, 10, 269, 53, 1, 14, 4961, 7, 2985, 13413, 496, 12567, 592, 86, 496, 2, 10919, 592, 429, 50, 8, 51, 86, 496, 1, 3243, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 43, 1, 286, 533, 329, 91, 92, 205, 44, 4509, 237, 35, 118, 523, 1, 5669, 7, 587, 54, 103, 419, 328, 24, 5434, 103, 12688, 4647, 103, 6841, 2, 3590, 103, 127, 640, 41719, 547, 11989, 103, 7256, 4987, 158, 365, 111, 329, 967, 287, 10, 179, 27, 179, 27, 2, 175, 27, 9, 135, 357, 12688, 6841, 2, 41719, 106, 19, 474, 365, 111, 118, 9, 7, 357, 7518, 6841, 2, 41719, 10, 511, 33, 605, 67, 2, 725, 106, 19, 239, 4, 8, 658, 65, 586, 9, 89, 1035, 4218, 944, 177, 2504, 398, 368, 2, 91, 28, 13413, 496, 125, 10, 77, 93, 118, 523, 107, 3, 169, 271, 1221, 4, 26, 375, 1570, 459, 180, 1, 7, 5, 220, 3084, 5460, 280, 43, 1223, 73, 5, 3243, 1292, 1, 3, 96, 841, 95, 419, 328, 640, 7518, 2, 6841, 97, 231, 118, 191, 496, 1, 3243, 10, 41, 5, 8, 142, 43, 1, 329, 91]",1824.0,28350519,Outcome Lower-Risk Patients Myelodysplastic Syndromes 5q Deletion Failure Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents,65,0.11343804537521815
Myeloablative Versus Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-02-13,"Purpose The optimal regimen intensity before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown. We hypothesized that lower treatment-related mortality (TRM) with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) would result in improved overall survival (OS) compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC). To test this hypothesis, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing MAC with RIC in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients and Methods Patients age 18 to 65 years with HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 and < 5% marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT were randomly assigned to receive MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by HCT from HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. The primary end point was OS 18 months post-random assignment based on an intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary end points included relapse-free survival (RFS) and TRM. Results Planned enrollment was 356 patients; accrual ceased at 272 because of high relapse incidence with RIC versus MAC (48.3%; 95% CI, 39.6% to 56.4% and 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.3% to 19.8%, respectively; P < .001). At 18 months, OS for patients in the RIC arm was 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1% to 74.9%) versus 77.5% (95% CI, 69.4% to 83.7%) for those in the MAC arm (difference, 9.8%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 20.3%; P = .07). TRM with RIC was 4.4% (95% CI, 1.8% to 8.9%) versus 15.8% (95% CI, 10.2% to 22.5%) with MAC ( P = .002). RFS with RIC was 47.3% (95% CI, 38.7% to 55.4%) versus 67.8% (95% CI, 59.1% to 75%) with MAC ( P < .01). Conclusion OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared with MAC, with a statistically significant advantage in RFS with MAC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for fit patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",1072.0,149.0,Purpose optimal regimen intensity allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation HCT unknown hypothesized lower treatment-related mortality TRM reduced-intensity conditioning RIC improved overall survival OS compared myeloablative conditioning MAC test hypothesis performed phase III randomized trial comparing MAC RIC patients acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes Patients Methods Patients age 18 65 years HCT comorbidity index ≤ 4 5 marrow myeloblasts pre-HCT randomly assigned receive MAC n 135 RIC n 137 followed HCT HLA-matched related unrelated donors primary end point OS 18 months post-random assignment based intent-to-treat Secondary end points included relapse-free survival RFS TRM Planned enrollment 356 patients accrual ceased 272 high relapse incidence RIC versus MAC 48.3 95 CI 39.6 56.4 13.5 95 CI 8.3 19.8 respectively P .001 18 months OS patients RIC arm 67.7 95 CI 59.1 74.9 versus 77.5 95 CI 69.4 83.7 MAC arm difference 9.8 95 CI -0.8 20.3 P .07 TRM RIC 4.4 95 CI 1.8 8.9 versus 15.8 95 CI 10.2 22.5 MAC P .002 RFS RIC 47.3 95 CI 38.7 55.4 versus 67.8 95 CI 59.1 75 MAC P .01 OS higher MAC statistically significant RIC resulted lower TRM higher relapse rates compared MAC statistically significant advantage RFS MAC support use MAC standard care fit patients acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 3, 665, 477, 837, 348, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 16, 860, 21, 1237, 17, 280, 24, 139, 282, 5064, 5, 405, 837, 1933, 3365, 688, 757, 4, 231, 63, 25, 118, 72, 5, 3246, 1933, 7492, 6, 412, 26, 1492, 21, 173, 8, 124, 316, 384, 160, 1430, 7492, 5, 3365, 4, 7, 5, 286, 533, 15, 2040, 7, 2, 636, 7, 89, 203, 6, 556, 60, 5, 1085, 1879, 558, 1552, 39, 2, 33, 581, 14909, 671, 1085, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 7492, 78, 3978, 15, 3365, 78, 4352, 370, 20, 1085, 29, 1160, 655, 139, 15, 2092, 2344, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 118, 203, 53, 539, 2324, 4392, 90, 23, 35, 1697, 6, 943, 65, 568, 396, 862, 159, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 2, 5064, 99, 1465, 1798, 10, 8664, 7, 2262, 17710, 28, 6905, 408, 1, 64, 429, 287, 5, 3365, 185, 7492, 576, 27, 48, 58, 587, 49, 6, 664, 39, 2, 233, 33, 48, 58, 66, 27, 6, 326, 66, 106, 19, 144, 28, 203, 53, 118, 9, 7, 4, 3, 3365, 475, 10, 598, 67, 48, 58, 728, 14, 6, 794, 83, 185, 849, 33, 48, 58, 790, 39, 6, 852, 67, 9, 135, 4, 3, 7492, 475, 523, 83, 66, 48, 58, 13, 66, 6, 179, 27, 19, 1615, 5064, 5, 3365, 10, 39, 39, 48, 58, 14, 66, 6, 66, 83, 185, 167, 66, 48, 58, 79, 18, 6, 350, 33, 5, 7492, 19, 1111, 1272, 5, 3365, 10, 662, 27, 48, 58, 519, 67, 6, 614, 39, 185, 598, 66, 48, 58, 728, 14, 6, 481, 5, 7492, 19, 355, 1221, 118, 10, 142, 5, 7492, 84, 26, 10, 44, 712, 93, 3365, 627, 4, 280, 5064, 84, 142, 429, 151, 72, 5, 7492, 5, 8, 712, 93, 1874, 4, 1272, 5, 7492, 46, 74, 538, 3, 119, 1, 7492, 22, 3, 260, 1, 165, 9, 2975, 7, 5, 286, 533, 15, 2040]",1662.0,28380315,Myeloablative Versus Reduced-Intensity Hematopoietic Transplantation Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndromes,28,0.04886561954624782
Characteristics and outcomes of older patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia according to treatment approach.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-04-07,"The development of newer strategies to improve outcomes for older patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) is a critical unmet need. Establishing baseline metrics for evaluating newer approaches is important. s-AML was defined as 1 or more of the following: a history of an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD), a diagnosis of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and AML with karyotype abnormalities characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome. Newly diagnosed s-AML patients aged 60 to 75 years were grouped into 5 treatment cohorts: 1) patients receiving high- or intermediate-dose cytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy (IC), 2) patients receiving a hypomethylating agent (HMA) or HMA combinations, 3) patients receiving low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) combinations, 4) patients receiving CPX-351, and 5) patients receiving investigational (INV) agents. Nine hundred thirty-one patients met the age and s-AML criteria. Complete remission rates were statistically lower in the HMA group (36%) versus the IC (46%), CPX-351 (45%), and LDAC groups (43%). Patients receiving less intensive regimens (the HMA and LDAC groups combined) had superior overall survival (OS) in comparison with patients receiving IC-based regimens (median 6.9 vs 5.4 months; P = .048). Only 4.3% of the IC patients proceeded to transplantation, whereas 10.3% of the patients on lower intensity regimens did (P = .001). There was no difference in median survival between patients treated with CPX-351 and patients treated with conventional lower intensity approaches (P = .75). Age > 70 years, an adverse karyotype, and a prior AHD were associated with decreased OS in a multivariate analysis. Lower intensity approaches are associated with lower early mortality rates and improved OS in comparison with intensive regimens. OS is poor with currently available therapies with a median OS of 6 months (5.4-7.6 months across regimens). Unsatisfactory outcomes with other INV agents underscore the need for more effective therapies.

A phase 1 study of the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor in combination with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide in children with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias or myelodysplastic syndrome: A Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators' Consortium study (POE 10-03).,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-04-14,"Plerixafor, a reversible CXCR4 antagonist, inhibits interactions between leukemic blasts and the bone marrow stromal microenvironment and may enhance chemosensitivity. A phase 1 trial of plerixafor in combination with intensive chemotherapy in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was performed to determine a tolerable and biologically active dose. Plerixafor was administered daily for 5 days at four dose levels (6, 9, 12, and 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> /dose) followed 4 hr later by high-dose cytarabine (every 12 hr) and etoposide (daily). Nineteen patients (13 with AML, 5 with ALL, 1 with MDS) were treated. The most common grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable to plerixafor were febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Plerixafor exposure increased with increasing dose levels and clearance was similar on days 1 and 5. Eighteen patients were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one patient achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): all three had AML. No responses were seen in patients with ALL or MDS. Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts into the peripheral blood in 14 of 16 evaluable patients (median 3.4-fold increase), and the degree of mobilization correlated with surface CXCR4 expression. Plerixafor, in combination with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide, was well tolerated in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias and MDS. While biologic responses were observed, clinical responses in this heavily pretreated cohort were modest.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1012.0,18.0,Plerixafor reversible CXCR4 antagonist inhibits interactions leukemic blasts bone marrow stromal microenvironment enhance chemosensitivity phase 1 trial plerixafor combination intensive chemotherapy children young adults relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS performed determine tolerable biologically active dose Plerixafor administered daily 5 days dose levels 6 9 12 15 mg/m sup 2 /sup /dose followed 4 hr later high-dose cytarabine 12 hr etoposide daily Nineteen patients 13 AML 5 1 MDS treated common grade 3 greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable plerixafor febrile neutropenia hypokalemia dose-limiting toxicities DLTs Plerixafor exposure increased increasing dose levels clearance similar days 1 5 Eighteen patients evaluable response patients achieved complete remission CR patient achieved CR incomplete hematologic recovery CRi AML responses seen patients MDS Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts peripheral blood 14 16 evaluable patients median 3.4-fold increase degree mobilization correlated surface CXCR4 expression Plerixafor combination high-dose cytarabine etoposide tolerated children young adults relapsed/refractory acute leukemias MDS biologic responses observed clinical responses heavily pretreated cohort modest,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5583, 8, 2786, 2318, 3137, 1576, 1286, 59, 2015, 2438, 2, 3, 581, 1126, 995, 2, 68, 1304, 5522, 8, 124, 14, 160, 1, 5583, 4, 150, 5, 1686, 56, 4, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 591, 15, 430, 286, 1275, 62, 286, 533, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 10, 173, 6, 223, 8, 2668, 2, 2665, 544, 61, 5583, 10, 468, 391, 9, 33, 162, 28, 294, 61, 148, 49, 83, 133, 2, 167, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 61, 370, 39, 168, 1559, 20, 64, 61, 1855, 454, 133, 168, 2, 1934, 391, 3498, 7, 233, 5, 329, 33, 5, 62, 14, 5, 1223, 11, 73, 3, 96, 186, 88, 27, 15, 378, 3534, 385, 2971, 6, 5583, 11, 2498, 778, 2, 7799, 125, 11, 77, 61, 817, 385, 2506, 5583, 645, 101, 5, 602, 61, 148, 2, 1960, 10, 288, 23, 162, 14, 2, 33, 3195, 7, 11, 859, 9, 51, 100, 7, 513, 236, 734, 684, 2, 104, 69, 513, 684, 5, 2610, 813, 1602, 6341, 62, 169, 42, 329, 77, 253, 11, 527, 4, 7, 5, 62, 15, 1223, 5583, 7695, 2015, 2438, 237, 3, 672, 315, 4, 213, 1, 245, 859, 7, 52, 27, 39, 1116, 344, 2, 3, 1444, 1, 4030, 438, 5, 1255, 2318, 55, 5583, 4, 150, 5, 64, 61, 1855, 2, 1934, 10, 149, 421, 4, 541, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 591, 430, 286, 2792, 2, 1223, 369, 1283, 253, 11, 164, 38, 253, 4, 26, 2447, 2193, 180, 11, 1721]",1617.0,28409853,phase 1 CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor combination high-dose cytarabine etoposide children relapsed refractory acute leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators Consortium POE 10-03,0,0.0
Morbidity and mortality after treatment of Ewing sarcoma: A single-institution experience.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-04-18,"Children, adolescents, and young adults treated for Ewing sarcoma (ES) are at risk for disease-related and treatment-related complications. We aimed to describe early and late overall mortality, cause-specific mortality, and key adverse health outcomes in a large, single-institutional cohort of patients with ES. Patients with ES diagnosed at age less than 40 years and treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering between 1974 and 2012 were included. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards were used to examine the association of clinical and pathologic variables with overall survival. Cause-specific mortality was evaluated with the cumulative incidence function accounting for competing risks. Three hundred patients with ES (60.3% male; median age at diagnosis: 16.8 years [range: 0.3-39]; 30.0% with metastatic disease at diagnosis) were followed for a median of 7.8 years (range: 0.2-37). Five-year overall survival was 65.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.8-71.1%) for the entire cohort; 78.6% for those with localized disease; 40.1% for those with isolated pulmonary metastases; and 28.1% for those with extrapulmonary metastases. In multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis, minority race/ethnicity, and metastatic disease at diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Ten-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 40.1%, with eight late relapses occurring at a median of 6.3 years after diagnosis (range: 5-14).

Clinical Outcomes of 217 Patients with Acute Erythroleukemia According to Treatment Type and Line: A Retrospective Multinational Study.,International journal of molecular sciences,Int J Mol Sci,2017-04-14,"Acute erythroleukemia (AEL) is a rare disease typically associated with a poor prognosis. The median survival ranges between 3-9 months from initial diagnosis. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to prolong survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML, but there is limited data of their efficacy in AEL. We collected data from 210 AEL patients treated at 28 international sites. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for subgroup comparisons. Survival between treatment groups was compared using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Eighty-eight patients were treated with HMAs, 44 front line, and 122 with intensive chemotherapy (ICT). ICT led to a higher overall response rate (complete or partial) compared to first-line HMA (72% vs. 46.2%, respectively; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), but similar progression-free survival (8.0 vs. 9.4 months; <i>p</i> = 0.342). Overall survival was similar for ICT vs. HMAs (10.5 vs. 13.7 months; <i>p</i> = 0.564), but patients with high-risk cytogenetics treated with HMA first-line lived longer (7.5 for ICT vs. 13.3 months; <i>p</i> = 0.039).

"Bevacizumab and paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy and secondary cytoreduction in recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study GOG-0213): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-04-21,"Platinum-based chemotherapy doublets are a standard of care for women with ovarian cancer recurring 6 months after completion of initial therapy. In this study, we aimed to explore the roles of secondary surgical cytoreduction and bevacizumab in this population, and report the results of the bevacizumab component here. The multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 GOG-0213 trial was done in 67 predominantly academic centres in the USA (65 centres), Japan (one centre), and South Korea (one centre). Eligible patients were adult women (aged ≥18 years) with recurrent measurable or evaluable epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and a clinical complete response to primary platinum-based chemotherapy, who had been disease-free for at least 6 months following last infused cycle of platinum. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard chemotherapy (six 3-weekly cycles of paclitaxel [175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area] and carboplatin [area under the curve 5]) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of bodyweight) every 3 weeks and continued as maintenance every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Individuals who participated in both the bevacizumab objective and surgical objective (which is ongoing) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either of these two chemotherapy regimens with or without prior secondary cytoreductive surgery. Randomisation for the bevacizumab objective was stratified by treatment-free interval and participation in the surgical objective. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00565851. Between Dec 10, 2007, and Aug 26, 2011, 674 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to standard chemotherapy (n=337) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (n=377). Median follow-up at the end of the trial on Nov 5, 2014, was 49·6 months in each treatment group (IQR 41·5-62·2 for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab; IQR 40·8-59·3 for chemotherapy), at which point 415 patients had died (214 in the chemotherapy group and 201 in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group). Based on pretreatment stratification data, median overall survival in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group was 42·2 months (95% CI 37·7-46·2) versus 37·3 months (32·6-39·7) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·829; 95% CI 0·683-1·005; p=0·056). We identified incorrect treatment-free interval stratification data for 45 (7%) patients (equally balanced between treatment groups); a sensitivity analysis of overall survival based on the audited treatment-free interval stratification data gave an adjusted HR of 0·823 (95% CI 0·680-0·996; p=0·0447). In the safety population (all patients who initiated treatment), 317 (96%) of 325 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group had at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event compared with 282 (86%) of 332 in the chemotherapy group; the most frequently reported of these in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group were hypertension (39 [12%] vs two [1%]), fatigue (27 [8%] vs eight [2%]), and proteinuria (27 [8%] vs none). Two (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the chemotherapy group (infection [n=1] and myelodysplastic syndrome [n=1]) compared with nine (3%) in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group (infection [n=1], febrile neutropenia [n=1], myelodysplastic syndrome [n=1], secondary malignancy [n=1]; deaths not classified with CTCAE terms: disease progression [n=3], sudden death [n=1], and not specified [n=1]). The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy, followed by maintenance therapy until progression, improved the median overall survival in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Although the intention-to-treat analysis for overall survival was not significant, our sensitivity analysis based on corrected treatment-free interval stratification indicates that this strategy might be an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in these patients.

"Olaparib in combination with irinotecan, cisplatin, and mitomycin C in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.",Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2017-07-01,"Olaparib is an oral inhibitor of polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose polymerization (PARP) that has previously shown signs of activity in patients with BRCA mutations and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this phase 1 dose-escalation trial in patients with unresectable PDAC, we determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib (tablet formulation) in combination with irinotecan 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle (olaparib plus IC). We then studied the safety and tolerability of adding mitomycin C 5 mg/m2 on day 1 to this regimen (olaparib plus ICM). 18 patients with unresectable PDAC were enrolled. The MTD of olaparib plus IC was olaparib 100 mg twice-daily on days 1 and 8. The addition of mitomycin C to this dose level was not tolerated. Grade ≥3 drug-related adverse events (AEs) were encountered in 16 patients (89%). The most common grade ≥3 drug-related toxicities included neutropenia (89%), lymphopenia (72%), and anemia (22%). Two patients (11%), both of whom had remained on study for more than 12 cycles, developed drug-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objective response rate (ORR) for all evaluable patients was 23%. One patient who carried a deleterious germline BRCA2 mutation had a durable clinical response lasting more than four years, but died from complications of treatment-related MDS. Olaparib had substantial toxicity when combined with IC or ICM in patients with PDAC, and this treatment combination did not have an acceptable risk/benefit profile for further study. However, durable clinical responses were observed in a subset of patients and further clinical investigation of PARP inhibitors in PDAC is warranted.

RIT was administered for progressive FL in 111 (97%) patients and as first-line therapy in the remaining 4. 28% (n = 32) had HT, occurring at a median of 60 months from diagnosis and 20 months after RIT. 48% (12/25) of patients who received fludarabine developed HT. The estimated 10-year risk of HT in the fludarabine and non-fludarabine groups was 67% and 26% respectively (P = 0·015). Only prior fludarabine was significantly associated with predicting the risk of HT after RIT. 8% (9/115) of patients developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (tMDS/AML) at a median of 41·4 months (range, 5-89). The estimated 10-year risk of tMDS/AML in non-fludarabine treated patients (n = 90) versus fludarabine treated (n = 25) was 13% and 29%, respectively.

Clin. Oncol.,2017-05-09,"Purpose Azacitidine is standard, first-line therapy in higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Whether azacitidine-based combinations with lenalidomide or vorinostat produce superior overall response rates (ORRs) to azacitidine is not known. Patients and Methods North American Intergroup Study S1117 is a phase II/III trial that randomly assigned patients with higher-risk MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 1:1:1 to azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle); azacitidine plus lenalidomide (10 mg/day on days 1 to 21); or azacitidine plus vorinostat (300 mg twice daily on days 3 to 9). The primary phase II end point was improved ORR. Results Of 277 patients from 90 centers, 92 received azacitidine, 93 received azacitidine plus lenalidomide, and 92 received azacitidine plus vorinostat. Median age was 70 years (range, 28 to 93 years), 85 patients (31%) were female, and 53 patients (19%) had CMML. Serious adverse events were similar across arms, although combination-arm patients were more likely to undergo nonprotocol-defined dose modifications ( P < .001).With a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 1 to 43 months), the ORR was 38% for patients receiving azacitidine, 49% for azacitidine plus lenalidomide ( P = .14 v azacitidine), and 27% for azacitidine plus vorinostat ( P = .16 v azacitidine). For patients with CMML, ORR was higher for azacitidine plus lenalidomide versus azacitidine (68% v 28%, P = .02) but similar for all arms across cytogenetic subgroups, as was remission duration and overall survival. ORR was higher with mutations in DNMT3A and lower for SRSF2, whereas ORR duration improved with fewer mutations. Lenalidomide dose reduction was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.30; P = .05). Conclusion Patients with higher-risk MDS treated with azacitidine-based combinations had similar ORR to azacitidine monotherapy, although patients with CMML benefitted from azacitidine plus lenalidomide. The efficacy of combination regimens may have been affected by dose modifications.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",987.0,81.0,Purpose Azacitidine standard first-line therapy higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes MDS azacitidine-based combinations lenalidomide vorinostat produce superior overall response rates ORRs azacitidine known Patients Methods North American Intergroup S1117 phase II/III trial randomly assigned patients higher-risk MDS chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML 1:1:1 azacitidine 75 mg/m sup 2 /sup /day days 1 7 28-day cycle azacitidine plus lenalidomide 10 mg/day days 1 21 azacitidine plus vorinostat 300 mg twice daily days 3 9 primary phase II end point improved ORR 277 patients 90 centers 92 received azacitidine 93 received azacitidine plus lenalidomide 92 received azacitidine plus vorinostat Median age 70 years range 28 93 years 85 patients 31 female 53 patients 19 CMML adverse events similar arms combination-arm patients likely undergo nonprotocol-defined dose modifications P .001 .With median follow-up 23 months range 1 43 months ORR 38 patients receiving azacitidine 49 azacitidine plus lenalidomide P .14 v azacitidine 27 azacitidine plus vorinostat P .16 v azacitidine patients CMML ORR higher azacitidine plus lenalidomide versus azacitidine 68 v 28 P .02 similar arms cytogenetic subgroups remission duration overall survival ORR higher DNMT3A lower SRSF2 ORR duration improved fewer Lenalidomide dose reduction associated worse overall survival hazard ratio 1.30 P .05 Patients higher-risk MDS treated azacitidine-based combinations similar ORR azacitidine monotherapy patients CMML benefitted azacitidine plus lenalidomide efficacy combination regimens affected dose modifications,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 3752, 16, 260, 157, 328, 36, 4, 142, 43, 2040, 1223, 317, 3752, 90, 1247, 5, 1288, 15, 2371, 2410, 1123, 63, 51, 151, 10767, 6, 3752, 16, 44, 440, 7, 2, 636, 2669, 597, 4839, 45, 50367, 16, 8, 124, 215, 316, 160, 17, 1108, 896, 7, 5, 142, 43, 1223, 2, 442, 5451, 3382, 14, 14, 14, 6, 3752, 481, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 218, 23, 162, 14, 6, 67, 1, 8, 339, 218, 417, 3752, 349, 1288, 79, 81, 218, 23, 162, 14, 6, 239, 15, 3752, 349, 2371, 2036, 81, 936, 391, 23, 162, 27, 6, 83, 3, 86, 124, 215, 396, 741, 10, 231, 1735, 99, 1, 7996, 7, 29, 424, 1168, 937, 103, 3752, 966, 103, 3752, 349, 1288, 2, 937, 103, 3752, 349, 2371, 52, 89, 10, 431, 60, 184, 339, 6, 966, 60, 772, 7, 456, 11, 1061, 2, 699, 7, 326, 42, 3382, 1762, 290, 281, 11, 288, 716, 1335, 242, 150, 475, 7, 11, 80, 322, 6, 1251, 21001, 395, 61, 2916, 19, 144, 5, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 382, 53, 184, 14, 6, 601, 53, 3, 1735, 10, 519, 9, 7, 357, 3752, 739, 9, 3752, 349, 1288, 19, 213, 603, 3752, 2, 428, 9, 3752, 349, 2371, 19, 245, 603, 3752, 9, 7, 5, 3382, 1735, 10, 142, 9, 3752, 349, 1288, 185, 3752, 806, 603, 339, 19, 588, 84, 288, 9, 62, 1335, 716, 1266, 1453, 22, 10, 734, 654, 2, 63, 25, 1735, 10, 142, 5, 138, 4, 6199, 2, 280, 9, 9830, 547, 1735, 654, 231, 5, 1497, 138, 1288, 61, 628, 10, 41, 5, 639, 63, 25, 360, 197, 14, 201, 19, 474, 1221, 7, 5, 142, 43, 1223, 73, 5, 3752, 90, 1247, 42, 288, 1735, 6, 3752, 1411, 242, 7, 5, 3382, 20703, 29, 3752, 349, 1288, 3, 209, 1, 150, 472, 68, 47, 85, 1424, 20, 61, 2916]",1965.0,28486043,Randomized Phase II Azacitidine Combination Lenalidomide Vorinostat Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia North American Intergroup SWOG S1117,0,0.0
"Bone marrow morphology is a strong discriminator between chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and reactive idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.",Haematologica,Haematologica,2017-05-11,"Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified can be difficult to distinguish from idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome according to the current World Health Organization guideline. To examine whether the morphological features of bone marrow might aid in the differential diagnosis of these two entities, we studied a total of 139 patients with a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (n=17) or idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (n=122). As a group, abnormal bone marrow morphological features, resembling myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasm or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, were identified in 40/139 (27%) patients: 16 (94%) of those with chronic eosinophilic leukemia and 24 (20%) of those with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Abnormal bone marrow correlated with older age (<i>P</i><0.001), constitutional symptoms (<i>P</i><0.001), anemia (<i>P</i>=0.041), abnormal platelet count (<i>P</i>=0.002), organomegaly (<i>P</i>=0.008), elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration (<i>P</i>=0.005), abnormal karyotype (<i>P</i><0.001), as well as the presence of myeloid neoplasm-related mutations (<i>P</i><0.001). Patients with abnormal bone marrow had shorter survival (48.1 months <i>versus</i> not reached, <i>P</i><0.001), a finding which was independent of other confounding factors (<i>P</i><0.001). The association between abnormal bone marrow and shorter survival was also observed in hypereosinophilic syndrome patients alone. In summary, most patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and a proportion of those with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome show abnormal bone marrow features similar to the ones encountered in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm or <i>BCR-ABL1</i>-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm. Among patients who are currently considered to have idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, abnormal bone marrow is a strong indicator of clonal hematopoiesis.

Germline ETV6 mutations and predisposition to hematological malignancies.,International journal of hematology,Int. J. Hematol.,2017-05-29,"Patients with thrombocytopenia 5 have an autosomal dominant disorder of decreased platelet number with tendency to bleed, usually presenting in childhood, and have been found to have germline mutations in ETV6, which encodes a master hematopoietic transcription factor. Some patients who present similarly have inherited mutations in RUNX1 or ANKRD26. All three germline syndromes are also associated with a predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL). Since the first description of germline ETV6 mutations, 18 families have been reported. The common phenotype is mild to moderate thrombocytopenia with a variable predisposition to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and MDS. This review will focus upon the role of ETV6 in hematopoiesis, especially in myeloid differentiation and maturation, and will describe the functional effects of mutant ETV6.

Robust patient-derived xenografts of MDS/MPN overlap syndromes capture the unique characteristics of CMML and JMML.,Blood,Blood,2017-06-02,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) are myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap disorders characterized by monocytosis, myelodysplasia, and a characteristic hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Currently, there are no available disease-modifying therapies for CMML, nor are there preclinical models that fully recapitulate the unique features of CMML. Through use of immunocompromised mice with transgenic expression of human GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and stem cell factor in a NOD/SCID-IL2Rγ<sup>null</sup> background (NSGS mice), we demonstrate remarkable engraftment of CMML and JMML providing the first examples of serially transplantable and genetically accurate models of CMML. Xenotransplantation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (n = 8 patients) or unfractionated bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (n = 10) resulted in robust engraftment of CMML in BM, spleen, liver, and lung of recipients (n = 82 total mice). Engrafted cells were myeloid-restricted and matched the immunophenotype, morphology, and genetic mutations of the corresponding patient. Similar levels of engraftment were seen upon serial transplantation of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in secondary NSGS recipients (2/5 patients, 6/11 mice), demonstrating the durability of CMML grafts and functionally validating CD34<sup>+</sup> cells as harboring the disease-initiating compartment in vivo. Successful engraftments of JMML primary samples were also achieved in all NSGS recipients (n = 4 patients, n = 12 mice). Engraftment of CMML and JMML resulted in overt phenotypic abnormalities and lethality in recipients, which facilitated evaluation of the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib in vivo. These data reveal that NSGS mice support the development of CMML and JMML disease-initiating and mature leukemic cells in vivo, allowing creation of genetically accurate preclinical models of these disorders.",Journal Article,963.0,19.0,Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia JMML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS /myeloproliferative neoplasm MPN overlap disorders characterized monocytosis myelodysplasia characteristic hypersensitivity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF Currently available disease-modifying therapies CMML preclinical models fully recapitulate unique features CMML use immunocompromised mice transgenic expression human GM-CSF interleukin-3 stem factor NOD/SCID-IL2Rγ sup null /sup background NSGS mice demonstrate remarkable engraftment CMML JMML providing examples serially transplantable genetically accurate models CMML Xenotransplantation CD34 sup /sup n 8 patients unfractionated bone marrow BM peripheral blood mononuclear n 10 resulted robust engraftment CMML BM spleen liver lung recipients n 82 total mice Engrafted myeloid-restricted matched immunophenotype morphology genetic corresponding patient Similar levels engraftment seen serial transplantation human CD34 sup /sup secondary NSGS recipients 2/5 patients 6/11 mice demonstrating durability CMML grafts functionally validating CD34 sup /sup harboring disease-initiating compartment vivo Successful engraftments JMML primary achieved NSGS recipients n 4 patients n 12 mice Engraftment CMML JMML resulted overt phenotypic abnormalities lethality recipients facilitated evaluation JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib vivo reveal NSGS mice support development CMML JMML disease-initiating mature leukemic vivo allowing creation genetically accurate preclinical models disorders,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 5451, 3382, 2, 7857, 5451, 16768, 32, 681, 1223, 10857, 2131, 4125, 4526, 1997, 765, 20, 16875, 6128, 2, 8, 2037, 4034, 6, 2764, 2674, 1975, 2122, 161, 2147, 1211, 694, 125, 32, 77, 390, 34, 4898, 235, 9, 3382, 2110, 32, 125, 693, 274, 17, 1910, 7746, 3, 991, 404, 1, 3382, 298, 119, 1, 7796, 399, 5, 2862, 55, 1, 171, 2147, 1211, 1603, 27, 2, 452, 31, 161, 4, 8, 7324, 4129, 27051, 172, 3505, 172, 2426, 36431, 399, 21, 608, 3813, 2881, 1, 3382, 2, 16768, 1736, 3, 157, 4416, 1, 6754, 11459, 2, 2301, 1481, 274, 1, 3382, 20362, 1, 2215, 172, 172, 37, 78, 66, 7, 15, 16341, 581, 1246, 15, 672, 315, 3041, 37, 78, 79, 627, 4, 1922, 2881, 1, 3382, 4, 1246, 4071, 2, 1, 2190, 78, 878, 181, 399, 6914, 37, 11, 533, 2016, 2, 655, 3, 5496, 2567, 2, 336, 138, 1, 3, 1734, 69, 288, 148, 1, 2881, 11, 527, 1548, 2108, 497, 1, 171, 2215, 172, 172, 37, 4, 568, 36431, 2190, 18, 33, 7, 49, 175, 399, 2219, 3, 6867, 1, 3382, 4713, 2, 3772, 6897, 2215, 172, 172, 37, 22, 2105, 3, 34, 2637, 3616, 4, 386, 1401, 36416, 1, 16768, 86, 347, 11, 120, 513, 4, 62, 36431, 2190, 78, 39, 7, 78, 133, 399, 2881, 1, 3382, 2, 16768, 627, 4, 7192, 3290, 1171, 2, 3266, 4, 2190, 92, 4667, 451, 1, 3, 2509, 1224, 230, 29404, 4, 386, 46, 74, 2396, 17, 36431, 399, 538, 3, 193, 1, 3382, 2, 16768, 34, 2637, 2, 2908, 2015, 37, 4, 386, 2952, 7560, 1, 2301, 1481, 693, 274, 1, 46, 1997]",1885.0,28576879,Robust patient-derived xenografts MDS/MPN overlap syndromes capture unique characteristics CMML JMML,297,0.518324607329843

Clinical characteristics and outcomes according to age in lenalidomide-treated patients with RBC transfusion-dependent lower-risk MDS and del(5q).,Journal of hematology & oncology,J Hematol Oncol,2017-06-26,"Particularly since the advent of lenalidomide, lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with del(5q) have been the focus of many studies; however, the impact of age on disease characteristics and response to lenalidomide has not been analyzed. We assessed the effect of age on clinical characteristics and outcomes in 286 lenalidomide-treated MDS patients with del(5q) from two multicenter trials. A total of 33.9, 34.3, and 31.8% patients were aged <65 years, ≥65 to <75 years, and ≥75 years, respectively. Age <65 years was associated with less favorable International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk and additional cytopenias at baseline versus older age groups, significantly lower cytogenetic response rates (p = 0.022 vs. ≥65 to <75 years; p = 0.047 vs. ≥75 years), and higher rates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression (Gray's test, p = 0.013).

Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-06-28,"Recipients of ex vivo T cell-depleted (TCD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are at risk of infection by double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. We report rates of dsDNA viremia, end-organ disease (EOD), infection-related mortality, and overall survival (OS) in a contemporary cohort of adult TCD HCT recipients routinely monitored for cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Healthcare utilization in the first 6 months post-HCT was compared between patients with dsDNA viremia versus no viremia. This was an observational study of adult patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who received CD34<sup>+</sup> selected, peripheral blood HCT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from March 2012 through December 2014. Patients were prospectively monitored by quantitative PCR assays for CMV, ADV, HHV6, and EBV in whole blood or plasma. The cumulative incidence of viremia(s) at day +180, EOD at 1 year, and OS at 1 year were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test among patient with and without viremia/EOD. Standardized incidence ratios were used to compare overall length of hospital stay (LOS), number of readmissions after HCT, and length of readmissions through day +180. Of 156 patients, 96 (62%) were CMV recipient seropositive. Forty-two patients received grafts from matched related (27%), 86 from matched unrelated (55%), and 28 from mismatched (18%) donors. Overall, 132 patients (85%) had ≥1 viremia and 52 (33%) ≥2 viremias by day +180. The cumulative incidences for CMV, HHV6, ADV, and EBV viremia were 44%, 61%, 7%, and 16%, respectively, with median times of onset 28 days (interquartile range [IQR], 25 to 33), 33 days (IQR, 25 to 47), 60 days (IQR, 19 to 84), and 79 days (IQR, 54 to 106) post-HCT, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (18%) developed EOD by dsDNA viruses at 1 year post-HCT. Treatment for CMV accounted for 91% total antiviral treatment-days. Compared with patients with no viremia, patients with CMV viremia, HHV6 viremia, or ≥2 viremias experienced longer LOS (P <.001) and a higher number of readmissions (P <.001) by day +180. OS rate at 1 year was 79% and was similar between patients with or without dsDNA viremias. EOD was associated with lower 1-year OS rates (63.4%) versus without EOD (81.1%) (P = .02). Of 33 patients who died, 10 died due to infection, and 7 of these infection-related deaths were due to dsDNA viruses. Viremia by dsDNA viruses occurred in 85% of TCD HCT recipients by day +100 and 33% of patients experienced ≥2 viremias by day +180. CMV accounted for most antiviral use. CMV, HHV6, or ≥2 viremias were associated with more readmissions and longer LOS. One year OS rate was 78%. EOD by dsDNA viruses was associated with decreased 1-year OS.

The emerging role of immune checkpoint based approaches in AML and MDS.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2017-07-06,"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a major breakthrough in the field of cancer therapeutics. Pursuant to their success in melanoma and numerous solid tumor malignancies, these agents are being investigated in hematological malignancies including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although AML/MDS have traditionally been considered to be less immunogenic than solid tumor malignancies, recent pre-clinical models suggest a therapeutic role for immune checkpoint inhibition in these diseases. CTLA-4 inhibition may be especially effective in treating late post-allogeneic stem cell transplant relapse of AML in patients with limited or no graft versus host disease. Immune checkpoint inhibition, specifically PD-1 inhibition, demonstrated limited single agent efficacy in patients with relapsed AML and with MDS post-hypomethylating therapy. Rationally designed combinations of PD-1 inhibitors with standard anti-leukemic therapy are needed. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine, up-regulate PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in patients with AML/MDS and up-regulation of these genes was associated with the emergence of resistance. The combination of azacitidine and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition may be a potential mechanism to prevent or overcome resistance to 5-azacitidine. A number of such combinations are being evaluated in clinical trials with early encouraging results. Immune checkpoint inhibition is also an attractive option to improve relapse-free survival or eliminate minimal residual disease post induction and consolidation by enhancing T-cell surveillance in patients with high-risk AML. The ongoing clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors in AML/MDS will improve our understanding of the immunobiology of these diseases and guide us to the most appropriate application of these agents in the therapy of AML/MDS.",Journal Article,929.0,23.0,development immune checkpoint inhibitors represents major breakthrough field therapeutics Pursuant success melanoma numerous solid malignancies agents investigated hematological malignancies including acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndromes MDS AML/MDS traditionally considered immunogenic solid malignancies recent pre-clinical models suggest therapeutic role immune checkpoint inhibition diseases CTLA-4 inhibition especially effective treating late post-allogeneic stem transplant relapse AML patients limited graft versus host disease Immune checkpoint inhibition specifically PD-1 inhibition demonstrated limited single agent efficacy patients relapsed AML MDS post-hypomethylating therapy Rationally designed combinations PD-1 inhibitors standard anti-leukemic therapy needed Hypomethylating agents azacitidine up-regulate PD-1 PD-L1 PD-L2 patients AML/MDS up-regulation associated emergence resistance combination azacitidine PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition potential mechanism prevent overcome resistance 5-azacitidine number combinations evaluated clinical trials early encouraging Immune checkpoint inhibition attractive option improve relapse-free survival eliminate minimal residual disease post induction consolidation enhancing T-cell surveillance patients high-risk AML ongoing clinical trials checkpoint inhibitors AML/MDS improve understanding immunobiology diseases guide appropriate application agents therapy AML/MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 193, 1, 250, 986, 222, 1449, 8, 458, 6022, 4, 3, 1067, 1, 12, 1943, 35365, 6, 136, 1825, 4, 2, 2331, 537, 30, 441, 46, 183, 32, 486, 565, 4, 2890, 441, 141, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 2040, 1223, 242, 329, 1223, 47, 4206, 85, 515, 6, 40, 299, 4190, 76, 537, 30, 441, 435, 671, 38, 274, 309, 8, 189, 200, 9, 250, 986, 297, 4, 46, 1342, 2127, 39, 297, 68, 40, 1093, 323, 4, 1367, 807, 539, 1063, 452, 31, 941, 429, 1, 329, 4, 7, 5, 383, 15, 77, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 250, 986, 297, 1225, 333, 14, 297, 264, 383, 226, 420, 209, 4, 7, 5, 591, 329, 2, 5, 1223, 539, 4931, 36, 6352, 1114, 1247, 1, 333, 14, 222, 5, 260, 312, 2015, 36, 32, 575, 4931, 183, 225, 22, 3752, 126, 2288, 333, 14, 333, 729, 2, 333, 5111, 4, 7, 5, 329, 1223, 2, 126, 863, 1, 46, 214, 10, 41, 5, 3, 3397, 1, 251, 3, 150, 1, 3752, 2, 333, 14, 333, 729, 297, 68, 40, 8, 174, 670, 6, 1682, 15, 1768, 251, 6, 33, 3752, 8, 207, 1, 225, 1247, 32, 486, 194, 4, 38, 143, 5, 191, 2269, 99, 250, 986, 297, 16, 120, 35, 3059, 1501, 6, 401, 429, 115, 25, 15, 4964, 1048, 753, 34, 539, 504, 2, 2173, 20, 2430, 102, 31, 617, 4, 7, 5, 64, 43, 329, 3, 942, 38, 143, 5, 986, 222, 4, 329, 1223, 303, 401, 114, 612, 1, 3, 18842, 1, 46, 1342, 2, 1597, 843, 6, 3, 96, 870, 1581, 1, 46, 183, 4, 3, 36, 1, 329, 1223]",1824.0,28679300,emerging role immune checkpoint based approaches AML MDS,7,0.012216404886561954
High prevalence of myeloid neoplasms in adults with non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,Blood,Blood,2017-07-05,"Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that most commonly affects adults and is driven by a high frequency of mutations in <i>BRAF</i>, <i>MAP2K1</i>, and kinases promoting MAPK signaling. Because of the relative rarity of ECD, key clinical features of the disease may not be well defined. Across a multi-institutional cohort of 189 patients with ECD and ECD overlapping with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (so-called mixed histiocytosis [MH]), we identified an unexpected and heretofore undescribed frequent occurrence of myeloid neoplasms among patients with ECD and MH. Some 10.1% (19/189) of patients with ECD have an overlapping myeloid neoplasm, most commonly occurring as a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or mixed MDS/MPN overlap syndrome (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Consistent with this, molecular analysis frequently detected hallmark driver mutations of myeloid neoplasms (such as <i>JAK2</i>V617F and <i>CALR</i> mutations) coexisting with those characteristic of histiocytosis (such as <i>BRAF</i>V600E and <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations). Histiocytosis patients diagnosed with a concomitant myeloid malignancy were significantly older at diagnosis and more commonly presented with MH than those without a myeloid malignancy. In some cases, the presence of distinct kinase mutations in the histiocytosis and myeloid neoplasm resulted in discordant and adverse responses to kinase-directed targeted therapies.

Risk of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,International journal of dermatology,Int. J. Dermatol.,2017-07-07,"Second hematologic cancers in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) are well documented and include Hodgkin lymphoma, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes, and transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Although cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) has been reported in patients with CLL, the incidence and comparison to expected rates are unknown. We evaluated the incidence of CTCL among patients with CLL or other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. We searched the SEER 13 registries for patients with a diagnosis of CLL and NHL between 1992 and 2008. Among patients identified, we evaluated the incidence of CTCL. Among 31,286 patients with CLL, the incidence of CTCL was not significantly higher in men than women: 104.2 (95% CI, 50.0-191.8) and 28.1 (95% CI, 3.4-101.3) per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively (P = 0.06). Among 97,691 patients with NHL, the incidence of CTCL was similar in men and women (97.9 [95% CI, 62.0-146.9] and 92.0 [95% CI, 56.2-142.1] per 1,000,000 person-years, respectively; P = 0.84). The incidence of CTCL among males with CLL (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 3.0 [95% CI, 1.4-5.5]), males with NHL (SIR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.3-5.5]), and females with NHL (SIR, 5.9 [95% CI, 3.6-9.1]) was significantly higher than expected in the general population (all P < 0.001).

"A Chemotherapy-Only Regimen of Busulfan, Melphalan, and Fludarabine, and Rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin Followed by Allogeneic T-Cell Depleted Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantations for the Treatment of Myeloid Malignancies.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-07-12,"We sought to develop a myeloablative chemotherapeutic regimen to secure consistent engraftment of T-cell depleted (TCD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) without the need for total body irradiation, thereby reducing toxicity while maintaining low rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and without increasing relapse. We investigated the myeloablative combination of busulfan (Bu) and melphalan (Mel), with the immunosuppressive agents fludarabine (Flu) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG) as cytoreduction before a TCD HSCT. No post-transplantation immunosuppression was administered. Between April 2001 and May 2008, 102 patients (median age, 55 years) with a diagnosis of primary or secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) underwent cytoreduction with Bu/Mel/Flu, followed by TCD grafts. TCD was accomplished by CD34<sup>+</sup>-selection followed by E-rosette depletion for peripheral blood stem cell grafts and, for bone marrow grafts, by soybean agglutination followed by E-rosette depletion. Donors included matched and mismatched, related and unrelated donors. Risk stratification was by American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk categorization for patients with primary disease. For patients with secondary/treatment-related MDS/AML, those in complete remission (CR) 1 or with refractory anemia were classified as intermediate risk, and all other patients were considered high risk. Neutrophil engraftment occurred at a median of 11 days in 100 of 101 evaluable patients. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute and chronic GVHD at 1 year were 8.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Overall- and disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 5 years were 50.0% and 46.1%, respectively, and the cumulative incidences of relapse and treatment-related mortality were 23.5% and 28.4%, respectively. Stratification by risk group demonstrated superior DFS for low-risk patients (61.5% at 5 years) compared with intermediate- or high-risk (34.2% and 40.0%, respectively, P = .021). For patients with AML, those in CR1 had superior 5-year DFS compared with those in ≥CR2 (60% and 30.6%, respectively, P = .01), without a significant difference in incidence of relapse (17.1% and 30.6%, respectively, P = .209). There were no differences in DFS for other patient, donor, or disease characteristics. In summary, cytoreduction with Bu/Mel/Flu and r-ATG secured consistent engraftment of TCD transplantations.

Vosaroxin in combination with decitabine in newly diagnosed older patients with acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2017-07-20,"Vosaroxin is an anti-cancer quinolone-derived DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. We investigated vosaroxin with decitabine in patients ≥60 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n=58) or myelodysplastic syndrome (≥10% blasts) (n=7) in a phase II non-randomized trial. The initial 22 patients received vosaroxin 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 4 with decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-5 every 4-6 weeks for up to seven cycles. Due to a high incidence of mucositis the subsequent 43 patients were given vosaroxin 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 4. These 65 patients, with a median age of 69 years (range, 60-78), some of whom with secondary leukemia (22%), adverse karyotype (35%), or <i>TP53</i> mutation (20%), are evaluable. The overall response rate was 74% including complete remission in 31 (48%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery in 11 (17%), and complete remission with incomplete count recovery in six (9%). The median number of cycles to response was one (range, 1-4). Grade 3/4 mucositis was noted in 17% of all patients. The 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> induction dose of vosaroxin was associated with similar rates of overall response (74% <i>versus</i> 73%) and complete remission (51% <i>versus</i> 41%, <i>P</i>=0.44), reduced incidence of mucositis (30% <i>versus</i> 59%, <i>P</i>=0.02), reduced 8-week mortality (9% <i>versus</i> 23%; <i>P</i>=0.14), and improved median overall survival (14.6 months <i>versus</i> 5.5 months, <i>P</i>=0.007).

Randomized phase 2 study of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in lower-risk MDS and MDS/MPN.,Blood,Blood,2017-08-03,"Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) improve survival in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but are less well-studied in lower-risk disease. We compared the safety and efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs low-dose azacitidine in this group of patients. Adults with low- or intermediate 1-risk MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, were randomly assigned using a Bayesian adaptive design to receive either azacitidine 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously/subcutaneously daily or decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously daily for 3 consecutive days on a 28-day cycle. The primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Between November 2012 and February 2016, 113 patients were treated: 40 (35%) with azacitidine and 73 (65%) with decitabine. The median age was 70 years; 81% of patients were intermediate 1-risk patients. The median number of cycles received was 9. The ORRs were 70% and 49% (<i>P</i> = .03) for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively. Thirty-two percent of patients treated with decitabine became transfusion independent compared with 16% of patients treated with azacitidine (<i>P</i> = .2). Cytogenetic response rates were 61% and 25% (<i>P</i> = .02), respectively. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the overall median event-free survival was 18 months: 20 and 13 months for patients treated with decitabine and azacitidine, respectively (<i>P</i> = .1). Treatment was well tolerated, with a 6-week mortality rate of 0%. The use of low-dose HMAs is safe and effective in patients with lower-risk MDS and MDS/MPN.

Replication and validation of genetic polymorphisms associated with survival after allogeneic blood or marrow transplant.,Blood,Blood,2017-08-15,"Multiple candidate gene-association studies of non-HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and outcomes after blood or marrow transplant (BMT) have been conducted. We identified 70 publications reporting 45 SNPs in 36 genes significantly associated with disease-related mortality, progression-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and/or overall survival after BMT. Replication and validation of these SNP associations were performed using DISCOVeRY-BMT (Determining the Influence of Susceptibility COnveying Variants Related to one-Year mortality after BMT), a well-powered genome-wide association study consisting of 2 cohorts, totaling 2888 BMT recipients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, and their HLA-matched unrelated donors, reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. Gene-based tests were used to assess the aggregate effect of SNPs on outcome. None of the previously reported significant SNPs replicated at <i>P</i> < .05 in DISCOVeRY-BMT. Validation analyses showed association with one previously reported donor SNP at <i>P</i> < .05 and survival; more associations would be anticipated by chance alone. No gene-based tests were significant at <i>P</i> < .05. Functional annotation with publicly available data shows these candidate SNPs most likely do not have biochemical function; only 13% of candidate SNPs correlate with gene expression or are predicted to impact transcription factor binding. Of these, half do not impact the candidate gene of interest; the other half correlate with expression of multiple genes.

Phase 1 dose escalation multicenter trial of pracinostat alone and in combination with azacitidine in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-08-25,"Pracinostat is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor with antitumor activity in both solid tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Pracinostat is reported to have modest clinical activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Given the higher preclinical sensitivity of hematologic malignancies to pracinostat, the authors conducted a phase 1 study to assess the safety, maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of pracinostat in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Pracinostat was administered orally 3 times a week for 3 weeks on a 28-day cycle. Patients were assigned to 7 dose levels using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. A total of 44 patients were enrolled, 25 of whom had AML and 14 of whom had myelodysplastic syndrome. The maximum tolerated dose was 120 mg and the recommended phase 2 dose was 60 mg. Two patients with AML achieved a response: 1 complete remission (CR) and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Despite a dose-dependent increase in the plasma concentration of pracinostat, a similar increase in histone acetylation was not observed. As an extension, 10 additional patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled to assess the safety and efficacy of pracinostat in combination with azacitidine.

"Guadecitabine (SGI-110) in treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia: phase 2 results from a multicentre, randomised, phase 1/2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-08-24,"The hypomethylating drugs azacitidine and decitabine have shown efficacy in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia, but complete tumour responses are infrequent and of short duration, possibly because of the short half-lives and suboptimal bone marrow exposure of the drugs. Guadecitabine, a next-generation hypomethylating drug, has a longer half-life and exposure than its active metabolite decitabine. A phase 1 study established 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> guadecitabine for 5 days as an effective treatment schedule. In this phase 2 study, we aimed to assess the safety and activity of two doses and schedules of guadecitabine in older (≥65 years) patients with treatment-naive acute myeloid leukaemia who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 1/2 study of guadecitabine in cohorts of patients with treatment-naive acute myeloid leukaemia, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes; here we report the phase 2 results from the cohort of treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. We included patients aged at least 65 years from 14 US medical centres (hospitals and specialist cancer clinics) who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy and randomly assigned them (1:1) using a computer algorithm (for dynamic randomisation) to guadecitabine 60 or 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-5 (5-day schedule) of a 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment allocation was not masked. We also assigned additional patients to guadecitabine 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in a 10-day schedule in a 28-day treatment cycle after a protocol amendment. The primary endpoint was composite complete response (complete response, complete response with incomplete platelet recovery, or complete response with incomplete neutrophil recovery regardless of platelets). Response was assessed in all patients (as-treated) who received at least one dose of guadecitabine. We present the final analysis, although at the time of the database lock, 15 patients were still in follow-up for overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01261312. Between Aug 24, 2012, and Sept 15, 2014, 107 patients were enrolled: 54 on the 5-day schedule (26 randomly assigned to 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 28 to 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 53 were assigned to the 10-day schedule. Median age was 77 years (range 62-92), and median follow-up was 953 days (IQR 721-1040). All treated patients were assessable for a response. The number of patients who achieved a composite complete response did not differ between dose groups or schedules (13 [54%, 95% CI 32·8-74·4] with 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on the 5-day schedule; 16 [59%; 38·8-77·6] with 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on the 5-day schedule; and 26 [50%, 35·8-64·2] with 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on the 10-day schedule). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events, regardless of relationship to treatment, were febrile neutropenia (31 [61%] of 51 patients on the 5-day schedule vs 36 [69%] of 52 patients on the 10-day schedule), thrombocytopenia (25 [49%] vs 22 [42%]), neutropenia (20 [39%] vs 18 [35%]), pneumonia (15 [29%] vs 19 [37%]), anaemia (15 [29%] vs 12 [23%]), and sepsis (eight [16%] vs 14 [27%]). The most common serious adverse events, regardless of relationship to treatment, for the 5-day and 10-day schedules, respectively, were febrile neutropenia (27 [53%] vs 25 [48%]), pneumonia (14 [27%] vs 16 [31%]), and sepsis (eight [16%] vs 14 [27%]). 23 (22%) patients died because of adverse events (mainly from sepsis, eight [8%]; and pneumonia, five [5%]); four deaths were from adverse events deemed treatment-related (pneumonia, two [2%]; multiorgan failure, one [1%]; and sepsis, one [1%], all in the 10-day cohort). More than half of older treatment-naive patients with acute myeloid leukaemia achieved a composite complete response with guadecitabine at all drug doses and schedules investigated, with tolerable toxicity. The recommended guadecitabine regimen for this population is 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in a 5-day schedule. A phase 3 study in this patient population is ongoing (NCT02348489) to assess guadecitabine 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in a 5-day schedule versus standard of care.

Impact of Fluid Overload as New Toxicity Category on Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Outcomes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-08-24,"Fluid overload (FO) commonly occurs during hospitalization for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We hypothesized that FO is associated with transplantation outcomes and evaluated this complication in 2 cohorts of patients. FO was graded based on post-transplantation weight gain, symptoms, and need for treatment, scored in real time by an independent team. The first cohort (study cohort; n = 145) underwent haploidentical transplantation for hematologic malignancies following a melphalan-based conditioning regimen. In univariate analysis, factors associated with day +100 nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were FO grade ≥2 (hazard ratio [HR], 15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.2 to 55; P < .001), creatinine >1 mg/dL (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 14; P = .005), and age >55 years (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 13; P = .008). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with day +100 NRM were FO grade ≥2 (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 3.4 to 50; P < .001) and serum creatinine level >1 mg/dL at transplantation admission (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 11; P = .03). These findings were verified in a separate cohort (validation cohort) of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent HLA-matched transplantation with busulfan-based conditioning (n = 449).

Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia masquerading as cutaneous indeterminate dendritic cell tumor: Expanding the spectrum of skin lesions in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,Journal of cutaneous pathology,J. Cutan. Pathol.,2017-09-27,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm exhibiting both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features. Cutaneous involvement by CMML is critical to recognize as it typically is a harbinger of disease progression and an increased incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Cutaneous lesions of CMML exhibit heterogeneous histopathologic features that can be challenging to recognize as CMML. We describe a 67-year-old man with a 3-year history of CMML who had been managed on single-agent azacitidine with stable disease before developing splenomegaly and acute onset skin lesions. Examination of these skin lesions revealed a dense infiltrate of histiocytic cells morphologically resembling Langerhans type cells (lacking frank histopathologic atypia), and with the immunophenotype of an indeterminate cell histiocytosis (S100+ CD1a+ and langerin-). Given the history of CMML, next-generation sequencing studies were performed on the skin biopsy. These revealed a KRAS (p.G12R) mutation identical to that seen in the CMML 3 years prior, establishing a clonal relationship between the 2 processes. This case expands the spectrum for and underscores the protean nature of cutaneous involvement by CMML and underscores the importance of heightened vigilance when evaluating skin lesions of CMML patients.",Case Reports,846.0,6.0,Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML hematopoietic stem neoplasm exhibiting myelodysplastic myeloproliferative features Cutaneous involvement CMML critical recognize typically harbinger disease progression increased incidence transformation acute myeloid leukemia Cutaneous lesions CMML exhibit heterogeneous histopathologic features challenging recognize CMML 67-year-old man 3-year history CMML managed single-agent azacitidine stable disease developing splenomegaly acute onset skin lesions Examination skin lesions revealed dense infiltrate histiocytic morphologically resembling Langerhans type lacking frank histopathologic atypia immunophenotype indeterminate histiocytosis S100+ CD1a+ langerin- Given history CMML next-generation sequencing studies performed skin biopsy revealed KRAS p.G12R identical seen CMML 3 years prior establishing clonal relationship 2 processes case expands spectrum underscores protean nature cutaneous involvement CMML underscores importance heightened vigilance evaluating skin lesions CMML patients,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[442, 5451, 3382, 16, 8, 1007, 452, 31, 2131, 4801, 110, 2, 404, 1486, 799, 20, 3382, 16, 740, 6, 4237, 22, 192, 1969, 16, 8, 24796, 1, 34, 91, 2, 35, 101, 287, 1, 1392, 6, 286, 533, 1486, 406, 1, 3382, 2239, 1564, 2630, 404, 17, 122, 40, 1950, 6, 4237, 22, 3382, 21, 897, 8, 598, 111, 1095, 3628, 5, 8, 27, 111, 532, 1, 3382, 54, 42, 85, 2231, 23, 226, 420, 3752, 5, 585, 34, 348, 931, 6364, 2, 286, 1707, 406, 1385, 1, 46, 406, 553, 8, 3076, 5172, 1, 12605, 37, 6204, 8855, 15702, 267, 37, 1941, 15252, 2630, 3598, 2, 5, 3, 5496, 1, 35, 5167, 31, 13976, 11456, 18288, 2, 50571, 447, 3, 532, 1, 3382, 1305, 914, 615, 94, 11, 173, 23, 3, 411, 46, 553, 8, 723, 19, 47723, 258, 3038, 6, 17, 527, 4, 3, 3382, 27, 60, 324, 4431, 8, 1946, 858, 59, 3, 18, 1849, 26, 473, 9365, 3, 1873, 9, 2, 6926, 3, 38764, 2202, 1, 1486, 799, 20, 3382, 2, 6926, 3, 1187, 1, 7145, 13264, 198, 1435, 406, 1, 3382, 7]",1260.0,28885734,Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia masquerading cutaneous indeterminate dendritic Expanding spectrum skin lesions chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,0,0.0
Haploidentical Transplantation for Older Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2017-09-14,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with HLA-matched donors is increasingly used for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It remains unclear if haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) is a suitable option for older patients with this disease. We analyzed 43 patients with AML/MDS (median age, 61 years) who underwent a haploSCT at our institution. All patients received a fludarabine-melphalan-based reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Except for 1 patient who had early death, the remaining 42 patients (98%) engrafted donor cells. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III to IV acute GVHD at 6 months were 35% and 5%, respectively, and chronic GVHD at 2 years was 9%. After a median follow-up of 19 months, 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and relapse incidence were 42%, 42%, and 24%, respectively. Best PFS (74% at 2 years) was seen in patients with intermediate-/good-risk cytogenetics, in first or second remission (hazard ratio, .4; P = .05), and with a younger donor (≤40 years; hazard ratio, .2; P = .01).

NY-ESO-1 Vaccination in Combination with Decitabine Induces Antigen-Specific T-lymphocyte Responses in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-09-25,"<b>Purpose:</b> Treatment options are limited for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The azanucleosides, azacitidine and decitabine, are first-line therapy for MDS that induce promoter demethylation and gene expression of the highly immunogenic tumor antigen NY-ESO-1. We demonstrated that patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving decitabine exhibit induction of NY-ESO-1 expression in circulating blasts. We hypothesized that vaccinating against NY-ESO-1 in patients with MDS receiving decitabine would capitalize upon induced NY-ESO-1 expression in malignant myeloid cells to provoke an NY-ESO-1-specific MDS-directed cytotoxic T-cell immune response.<b>Experimental Design:</b> In a phase I study, 9 patients with MDS received an HLA-unrestricted NY-ESO-1 vaccine (CDX-1401 + poly-ICLC) in a nonoverlapping schedule every four weeks with standard-dose decitabine.<b>Results:</b> Analysis of samples serially obtained from the 7 patients who reached the end of the study demonstrated induction of <i>NY-ESO-1</i> expression in 7 of 7 patients and NY-ESO-1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocyte responses in 6 of 7 and 4 of 7 of the vaccinated patients, respectively. Myeloid cells expressing NY-ESO-1, isolated from a patient at different time points during decitabine therapy, were capable of activating a cytotoxic response from autologous NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes. Vaccine responses were associated with a detectable population of CD141<sup>Hi</sup> conventional dendritic cells, which are critical for the uptake of NY-ESO-1 vaccine and have a recognized role in antitumor immune responses.<b>Conclusions:</b> These data indicate that vaccination against induced NY-ESO-1 expression can produce an antigen-specific immune response in a relatively nonimmunogenic myeloid cancer and highlight the potential for induced antigen-directed immunotherapy in a group of patients with limited options. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(5); 1019-29. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related commentary by Fuchs, p. 991</i>.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",848.0,18.0,b Purpose /b Treatment options limited patients high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome MDS azanucleosides azacitidine decitabine first-line therapy MDS induce promoter demethylation expression highly immunogenic antigen NY-ESO-1 demonstrated patients acute myeloid leukemia AML receiving decitabine exhibit induction NY-ESO-1 expression circulating blasts hypothesized vaccinating NY-ESO-1 patients MDS receiving decitabine capitalize induced NY-ESO-1 expression malignant myeloid provoke NY-ESO-1-specific MDS-directed cytotoxic T-cell immune response. b Experimental Design /b phase 9 patients MDS received HLA-unrestricted NY-ESO-1 vaccine CDX-1401 poly-ICLC nonoverlapping schedule weeks standard-dose decitabine. b /b serially obtained 7 patients reached end demonstrated induction NY-ESO-1 /i expression 7 7 patients NY-ESO-1-specific CD4 sup /sup CD8 sup /sup T-lymphocyte responses 6 7 4 7 vaccinated patients respectively Myeloid expressing NY-ESO-1 isolated patient different time points decitabine therapy capable activating cytotoxic response autologous NY-ESO-1-specific lymphocytes Vaccine responses associated detectable population CD141 sup Hi /sup conventional dendritic critical uptake NY-ESO-1 vaccine recognized role antitumor immune responses. b Conclusions /b indicate vaccination induced NY-ESO-1 expression produce antigen-specific immune response relatively nonimmunogenic myeloid highlight potential induced antigen-directed immunotherapy group patients limited options Clin Res 24 5 1019-29 ©2017 AACR /i related commentary Fuchs p. 991 /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 24, 838, 32, 383, 9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 681, 1223, 3, 40286, 3752, 2, 3004, 32, 157, 328, 36, 9, 1223, 17, 1290, 973, 6800, 2, 145, 55, 1, 3, 561, 4190, 30, 448, 2906, 3143, 14, 21, 264, 17, 7, 5, 286, 533, 329, 357, 3004, 2239, 504, 1, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 4, 1033, 2438, 21, 1237, 17, 20348, 480, 2906, 3143, 14, 4, 7, 5, 1223, 357, 3004, 688, 18909, 1548, 277, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 4, 393, 533, 37, 6, 20282, 35, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 1223, 1166, 759, 102, 31, 250, 51, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 4, 8, 124, 70, 45, 83, 7, 5, 1223, 103, 35, 1160, 16806, 2906, 3143, 14, 1274, 12417, 30992, 2699, 18064, 4, 8, 10142, 1055, 454, 294, 244, 5, 260, 61, 3004, 132, 99, 132, 65, 1, 347, 6754, 683, 29, 3, 67, 7, 54, 1300, 3, 396, 1, 3, 45, 264, 504, 1, 70, 2906, 3143, 14, 70, 55, 4, 67, 1, 67, 7, 2, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 1440, 172, 172, 2, 968, 172, 172, 102, 1448, 253, 4, 49, 1, 67, 2, 39, 1, 67, 1, 3, 5130, 7, 106, 533, 37, 1046, 2906, 3143, 14, 1355, 29, 8, 69, 28, 338, 98, 862, 190, 3004, 36, 11, 2787, 1, 1616, 8, 759, 51, 29, 1028, 2906, 3143, 14, 112, 102, 1594, 1274, 253, 11, 41, 5, 8, 2083, 266, 1, 71272, 172, 5910, 172, 809, 2464, 37, 92, 32, 740, 9, 3, 1135, 1, 2906, 3143, 14, 1274, 2, 47, 8, 1904, 200, 4, 579, 250, 253, 132, 2130, 132, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 1915, 480, 277, 2906, 3143, 14, 55, 122, 2410, 35, 448, 112, 250, 51, 4, 8, 1352, 19758, 533, 12, 2, 1817, 3, 174, 9, 277, 448, 1166, 726, 4, 8, 87, 1, 7, 5, 383, 838, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 33, 21118, 462, 3194, 1630, 70, 70, 3764, 139, 4662, 20, 71273, 19, 15374, 70]",1983.0,28947565,NY-ESO-1 Vaccination Combination Decitabine Induces Antigen-Specific T-lymphocyte Responses Patients Myelodysplastic Syndrome,2,0.0034904013961605585
"Therapy related-chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML): Molecular, cytogenetic, and clinical distinctions from de novo CMML.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-11-03,"Therapy related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) including therapy related myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) are associated with aggressive disease biologies and poor outcomes. In this large (n = 497) and informative (inclusive of molecular and cytogenetic information) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patient cohort, we demonstrate key biological insights and an independent prognostic impact for t-CMML. T-CMML was diagnosed in 9% of patients and occurred approximately 7 years after exposure to prior chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In comparison to de novo CMML, t-CMML patients had higher LDH levels, higher frequency of karyotypic abnormalities and had higher risk cytogenetic stratification. There were no differences in the distribution of gene mutations and unlike t-MDS/AML, balanced chromosomal translocations, abnormalities of chromosome 11q23 (1%) and Tp53 mutations (<2%) were uncommon. Molecularly integrated CMML prognostic models were not effective in risk stratifying t-CMML patients and responses to hypomethylating agents were dismal with no complete responses. Median overall (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) was shorter for t-CMML in comparison to d-CMML (Median OS 10.9 vs 26 months and median LFS 50 vs 127 months) and t-CMML independently and adversely impacted OS (P = .0001 HR 2.1 95% CI 1.4-3.0). This prognostic impact was retained in the context of the Mayo Molecular Model (P = .001, HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-3.7) and the GFM prognostic model (P < .0001, HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.5-3.7).

"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.",Clinical epigenetics,Clin Epigenetics,2017-10-05,"Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children. Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints. Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction). All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia. Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data. Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms. MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients. DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21. Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response. Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates. This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML. Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations. The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission. Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.

Tolerance and toxicity of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in older women with epithelial ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-10-14,"The objective of this study was to determine the overall tolerability and toxicity of olaparib capsules among older (≥65years) patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated on 8 completed prospective trials of olaparib. An ancillary data analysis of 398 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled on eight prospective trials of olaparib capsules was performed. Patients aged 65years and older were stratified into age groups by 5year increments (ages 65-69, 70-74, ≥75years) and compared to those <65. Analysis was restricted to those patients receiving the recommended treatment dose of 400mg PO b.i.d. Of the 398 patients included, 78 were ≥65 (age 65-69 n=38, age 70-74 n=23, age≥75 n=17). The majority of elderly patients were Caucasian (n=2 Asian) and had received ≥5 prior lines of chemotherapy. In patients <65, 46.9% required dose reduction as compared to 44.7% of patients 65-69years, 47.8% of patients 70-74years, and 64.7% of patients ≥75years (p=0.62). In patients <65years 41.2% required dose interruption, as compared to 50%, 43.5%, and 64.7% of patients aged 65-69, 70-74, and ≥75, respectively (p=0.11).

"Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Clinical Trial of Anti-T-Lymphocyte Globulin to Assess Impact on Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease-Free Survival in Patients Undergoing HLA-Matched Unrelated Myeloablative Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2017-10-17,"Purpose Several open-label randomized studies have suggested that in vivo T-cell depletion with anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG; formerly antithymocyte globulin-Fresenius) reduces chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) without compromising survival. We report a prospective, double-blind phase III trial to investigate the effect of ATLG (Neovii Biotech, Lexington, MA) on cGVHD-free survival. Patients and Methods Two hundred fifty-four patients 18 to 65 years of age with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were randomly assigned one to one to placebo (n =128 placebo) or ATLG (n = 126) treatment at 27 sites. Patients received either ATLG or placebo 20 mg/kg per day on days -3, -2, -1 in addition to tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis. The primary study end point was moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Results Despite a reduction in grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (23% v 40%; P = .004) and moderate-severe cGVHD (12% v 33%; P < .001) in ATLG recipients, no difference in moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival between ATLG and placebo was found (2-year estimate: 48% v 44%, respectively; P = .47). Both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower with ATLG (2-year estimate: 47% v 65% [ P = .04] and 59% v 74% [ P = .034], respectively). Multivariable analysis confirmed that ATLG was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.28; P = .026) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.71; P = .01). Conclusion In this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of ATLG in unrelated myeloablative HCT, the incorporation of ATLG did not improve moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival. Moderate-severe cGVHD was significantly lower with ATLG, but PFS and OS also were lower. Additional analyses are needed to understand the appropriate role for ATLG in HCT.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",826.0,62.0,Purpose open-label randomized studies suggested vivo T-cell depletion anti-T-lymphocyte globulin ATLG antithymocyte globulin-Fresenius reduces chronic graft-versus-host disease cGVHD compromising survival report prospective double-blind phase III trial investigate effect ATLG Neovii Biotech Lexington cGVHD-free survival Patients Methods fifty-four patients 18 65 years age acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome underwent myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated hematopoietic transplantation HCT randomly assigned placebo n =128 placebo ATLG n 126 treatment 27 sites Patients received ATLG placebo 20 mg/kg day days -3 -2 -1 addition tacrolimus methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis primary end point moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival Despite reduction grade 2 4 acute GVHD 23 v 40 P .004 moderate-severe cGVHD 12 v 33 P .001 ATLG recipients difference moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival ATLG placebo 2-year estimate 48 v 44 respectively P .47 progression-free survival PFS overall survival OS lower ATLG 2-year estimate 47 v 65 P .04 59 v 74 P .034 respectively Multivariable confirmed ATLG associated inferior PFS hazard ratio 1.55 95 CI 1.05 2.28 P .026 OS hazard ratio 1.74 95 CI 1.12 2.71 P .01 prospective randomized double-blind trial ATLG unrelated myeloablative HCT incorporation ATLG improve moderate-severe cGVHD-free survival Moderate-severe cGVHD significantly lower ATLG PFS OS lower Additional needed understand appropriate role ATLG HCT,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 392, 1020, 1756, 384, 94, 47, 1148, 17, 4, 386, 102, 31, 2286, 5, 312, 102, 1448, 7819, 20942, 7350, 11016, 7819, 71392, 2389, 442, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 6670, 187, 6102, 25, 21, 414, 8, 482, 1627, 3142, 124, 316, 160, 6, 963, 3, 254, 1, 20942, 71393, 24505, 71394, 3687, 23, 6670, 115, 25, 7, 2, 636, 100, 1128, 1461, 294, 7, 203, 6, 556, 60, 1, 89, 5, 286, 15, 681, 54, 208, 3246, 1160, 655, 2092, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 11, 1108, 896, 104, 6, 104, 6, 619, 78, 3990, 619, 15, 20942, 78, 3927, 24, 28, 428, 633, 7, 103, 361, 20942, 15, 619, 179, 81, 503, 379, 218, 23, 162, 27, 18, 14, 4, 352, 6, 5643, 2, 2116, 22, 1562, 2049, 3, 86, 45, 396, 741, 10, 1163, 905, 6670, 115, 25, 99, 550, 8, 628, 4, 88, 18, 6, 39, 286, 1562, 382, 603, 327, 19, 1520, 2, 1163, 905, 6670, 133, 603, 466, 19, 144, 4, 20942, 2190, 77, 523, 4, 1163, 905, 6670, 115, 25, 59, 20942, 2, 619, 10, 204, 18, 111, 1191, 576, 603, 584, 106, 19, 662, 110, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 63, 25, 118, 11, 280, 5, 20942, 18, 111, 1191, 662, 603, 556, 19, 755, 2, 728, 603, 794, 19, 5337, 106, 658, 65, 557, 17, 20942, 10, 41, 5, 1663, 300, 360, 197, 14, 614, 48, 58, 14, 474, 6, 18, 339, 19, 4554, 2, 118, 360, 197, 14, 794, 48, 58, 14, 133, 6, 18, 792, 19, 355, 1221, 4, 26, 482, 384, 1627, 3142, 160, 1, 20942, 4, 2092, 3246, 1085, 3, 2838, 1, 20942, 205, 44, 401, 1163, 905, 6670, 115, 25, 1163, 905, 6670, 10, 97, 280, 5, 20942, 84, 300, 2, 118, 120, 11, 280, 402, 318, 32, 575, 6, 1640, 3, 870, 200, 9, 20942, 4, 1085]",1794.0,29040031,Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Phase III Clinical Trial Anti-T-Lymphocyte Globulin Assess Impact Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease-Free Survival Patients Undergoing HLA-Matched Unrelated Myeloablative Hematopoietic Transplantation,2,0.0034904013961605585
MYD88 mutation status does not impact overall survival in Waldenström macroglobulinemia.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2017-11-17,"Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is an immunoglobulin M-associated lymphoma, with majority of cases demonstrating MYD88 locus alteration, most commonly, MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> . Owing to low prevalence of the wild-type (WT) MYD88 genotype in WM, clinically relevant data in this patient population are sparse, with one study showing nearly a 10-fold increased risk of mortality in this subgroup compared to patients with MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> mutation. We studied a large cohort of patients with MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> and MYD88<sup>WT</sup> WM, evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, between 1995 and 2016, to specifically assess the impact of these genotypes on clinical course. Of 557 patients, MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> mutation status, as determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, was known in 219, and 174 (79%) of those exhibited MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> , 157 of 174 patients had active disease. Of 45 (21%) patients with MYD88<sup>WT</sup> genotype, 44 had active disease. The estimated median follow-up was 7.0 years; median overall survival was 10.2 years (95% CI: 8.4-16.5) for MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> versus 13.9 years (95% CI: 6.4-29.3) for the MYD88<sup>WT</sup> (P = 0.86). The time-to-next therapy from frontline treatment and the presenting features were similar in the two patient populations. For patients with smoldering WM at diagnosis, the median time-to-progression to active disease was 2.8 years (95% CI: 2.2-3.8) in the MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> cohort and 1.9 years (95% CI: 0.7-3.1) in the MYD88<sup>WT</sup> cohort (P = 0.21). The frequency of transformation to high-grade lymphoma, or the development of therapy-elated myelodysplastic syndrome was higher in the MYD88<sup>WT</sup> cohort (16% versus 4% in the MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> , P = 0.009). In conclusion, MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> mutation does not appear to be a determinant of outcome, and its presence may not be a disease-defining feature in WM.

Impact of baseline cytogenetic findings and cytogenetic response on outcome of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and low blast count AML treated with azacitidine.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2017-10-27,"Karyotype according to the revised IPSS is a strong independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), however established in untreated patients. The prognostic impact of cytogenetics and cytogenetic response (CyR) in MDS patients receiving azacitidine (AZA) remains uncertain. We examined the prognostic value of baseline cytogenetics and CyR for overall response rate (ORR) and OS in 702 AZA-treated higher risk MDS and low blast count acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including 493 (70%) with abnormal karyotype. None of the cytogenetic abnormalities had significant impact on ORR (43.9%) or complete response (15.35%), except 3q abnormalities and complex karyotypes, which were associated with a lower ORR. OS differed significantly across all R-IPSS cytogenetic subgroups (p<10<sup>-4</sup>) but patients with non complex del(7q) had similar survival as patients with normal cytogenetics.

Hematol.,2017-11-22,"The prognostic value of peripheral blasts (PB) is not well-studied in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We evaluated the impact of PB on overall survival (OS) and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a large cohort. The MDS database at the Moffitt Cancer Center was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with ≥ 1% PB (PB-MDS) and those without PB (BM-MDS). We also assessed the correlation between PB and gene mutations. One thousand seven hundred fifty-eight patients were identified, among whom 13% had PB near the time of diagnosis. PB-MDS patients were more likely to be younger with trilineage cytopenia, complex karyotype, higher-risk disease, transfusion dependence, and therapy-related MDS. The rate of AML transformation was 49 vs. 26% (p < 0.005) and median OS was 16.5 vs. 45.8 months (p < 0.005) in the PB-MDS and BM-MDS groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, the presence of PB was an independent prognostic covariate for OS, HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.2-2).

All R/R myeloid patients (including AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)) treated with VEN combinations in the salvage setting were reviewed. Forty-three patients with median age 68 (range, 25-83) were treated for AML (91%), MDS (5%), or BPDCN (5%). Most (n = 36, 84%) were ≥ salvage-2 treatment status, including prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) in 77%. In combination with VEN, most patients received HMA therapy (n = 31, 72%); eight (19%) received low-dose cytarabine (LDAC). Patients received a median of 2 treatment cycles (range, 1-4). Objective response was observed in 9 (21%) patients, including 2 complete responses (CR), 3 CRi, and 4 morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). Median survival was 3.0 months (range, 0.5-8.0), and estimated 6-month survival was 24%.

Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome after adjuvant chemotherapy: A population-based study among older breast cancer patients.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-12-13,"Chemotherapy for early breast cancer is associated with a small risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to determine the risk of developing AML or MDS after modern adjuvant chemotherapy in older breast cancer patients and to further define the risk of individual chemotherapy regimens. Patients diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer from 2003 to 2009 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare linked databases. The development of AML/MDS, chemotherapy use, and comorbidities were identified with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes. Analyses included descriptive statistics, cumulative incidences, and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard of AML/MDS after adjustments for clinically relevant covariates. In all, 92,110 patients were included; after a median follow-up of 85 months, the overall rates per 1000 person-years were 0.65 for AML and 1.56 for MDS. Patients who received an anthracycline (A) or anthracycline and taxane (A+T) regimen were more likely to develop AML (hazard ratio [HR] for A, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.50; HR for A+T, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.22-2.30) or MDS (HR for A, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.70-2.80; HR for A+T, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.29-2.03) than patients who did not receive chemotherapy. Patients using docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) were not at increased risk for AML or MDS.

Between 2007 and 2013, 109 adults ages 50 and older underwent similar reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan and antibody-mediated T cell depletion for AML (n = 83) or high-risk MDS (n = 26) followed by either a MUD (n = 68) or haplo/cord (n = 41) graft. Patient characteristics were similar for each graft source except for more minority patients receiving a haplo/cord transplant (P = .01). One half of the AML patients were not in remission. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and graft-versus-host disease-free relapse-free survival were 38%, 48%, and 32.1% for MUD and 33%, 48%, and 33.8% for haplo/cord transplants (P = .62 for PFS; P = .97 for OS; P= .84), respectively.

Management of older adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).,Journal of geriatric oncology,J Geriatr Oncol,2017-12-29,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a varied group of hematologic neoplasms that lead to bone marrow failure, and also carry a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with MDS suffer significant impairments to both their quality of life and survival. Age is the dominant risk factor for the development of MDS, with a median age at diagnosis over 70years. Consequently, patients with MDS frequently have concurrent comorbidities and/or frailty which may be coincident or related to the disease itself. Disease characteristics, degree of comorbidity, and presence of frailty all impact prognosis. Treatment of MDS focuses on supportive care, with disease-modifying approaches (chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation) reserved for fit patients with high-risk disease.

CD34<sup>+</sup> Cell Selection versus Reduced-Intensity Conditioning and Unmodified Grafts for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients Age >50 Years with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome .,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-01-02,"Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and T cell depletion (TCD) through CD34<sup>+</sup> cell selection without the use of post-transplantation immunosuppression are 2 strategies used to reduce nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in older patients after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To compare the efficacy of the RIC and TCD approaches, we evaluated the outcomes of patients age >50 years with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent allo-HCT from an HLA-matched donor with one of these strategies. Baseline characteristics were comparable in the patients receiving TCD (n = 204) and those receiving RIC (n = 151), except for a higher proportion of unrelated donors (68% versus 40%; P < .001) and a higher comorbidity burden (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index [HCT-CI] ≥3: 51% versus 38%; P < .001) in the TCD cohort. Analysis of outcomes at 3 years showed a higher chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/relapse-free survival (CRFS) (51% versus 7%; P < .001), lower incidences of grade II-IV acute GVHD (18% versus 46% at day +180) and chronic GVHD (6% versus 55% at 3 years; P < .001), and a lower incidence of relapse (19% versus 33% at 3 years; P = .001) in the TCD group compared with the RIC group. Relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and NRM were similar in the 2 groups. Combining transplantation approach (RIC versus TCD) and comorbidity burden (HCT-CI 0-2 versus ≥3), patients with an HCT-CI score of 0-2 seemed to benefit from the TCD approach. In conclusion, in this retrospective study, the use of a CD34<sup>+</sup> cell-selected graft and a myeloablative conditioning regimen was associated with higher CRFS and similar RFS and OS compared with unmodified allo-RIC in patients age >50 years with AML and MDS.",Comparative Study,749.0,4.0,Reduced-intensity conditioning RIC depletion TCD CD34 sup /sup selection use post-transplantation immunosuppression 2 strategies reduce nonrelapse mortality NRM older patients allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation allo-HCT compare efficacy RIC TCD approaches evaluated outcomes patients age 50 years acute myelogenous leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndrome MDS underwent allo-HCT HLA-matched donor strategies Baseline characteristics comparable patients receiving TCD n 204 receiving RIC n 151 higher proportion unrelated donors 68 versus 40 P .001 higher comorbidity burden Hematopoietic Transplantation Comorbidity Index HCT-CI ≥3 51 versus 38 P .001 TCD cohort outcomes 3 years showed higher chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD /relapse-free survival CRFS 51 versus 7 P .001 lower incidences grade II-IV acute GVHD 18 versus 46 day +180 chronic GVHD 6 versus 55 3 years P .001 lower incidence relapse 19 versus 33 3 years P .001 TCD group compared RIC group Relapse-free survival RFS overall survival OS NRM similar 2 groups Combining transplantation approach RIC versus TCD comorbidity burden HCT-CI 0-2 versus ≥3 patients HCT-CI score 0-2 benefit TCD approach retrospective use CD34 sup /sup cell-selected graft myeloablative conditioning regimen associated higher CRFS similar RFS OS compared unmodified allo-RIC patients age 50 years AML MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[405, 837, 1933, 3365, 2, 102, 31, 2286, 8827, 298, 2215, 172, 172, 31, 881, 187, 3, 119, 1, 539, 497, 3646, 32, 18, 422, 95, 6, 969, 4640, 282, 4296, 4, 434, 7, 50, 1063, 1007, 31, 497, 2564, 1085, 6, 932, 3, 209, 1, 3, 3365, 2, 8827, 611, 21, 194, 3, 123, 1, 7, 89, 212, 60, 5, 286, 2194, 329, 2, 681, 1223, 54, 208, 2564, 1085, 29, 35, 1160, 655, 1488, 5, 104, 1, 46, 422, 330, 374, 11, 1279, 4, 3, 7, 357, 8827, 78, 5996, 2, 135, 357, 3365, 78, 5075, 2187, 9, 8, 142, 920, 1, 2092, 2344, 806, 185, 327, 19, 144, 2, 8, 142, 1879, 892, 1007, 31, 497, 1879, 558, 1085, 58, 2608, 725, 185, 519, 19, 144, 4, 3, 8827, 180, 65, 1, 123, 28, 27, 60, 224, 8, 142, 442, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 429, 115, 25, 21779, 725, 185, 67, 19, 144, 280, 3981, 1, 88, 215, 478, 286, 1562, 203, 185, 641, 28, 218, 3172, 2, 442, 1562, 49, 185, 614, 28, 27, 60, 19, 144, 2, 8, 280, 287, 1, 429, 326, 185, 466, 28, 27, 60, 19, 144, 4, 3, 8827, 87, 72, 5, 3, 3365, 87, 429, 115, 25, 1272, 63, 25, 118, 2, 4296, 11, 288, 4, 3, 18, 271, 1525, 497, 353, 3365, 185, 8827, 2, 1879, 892, 1085, 58, 13, 18, 185, 2608, 7, 5, 35, 1085, 58, 368, 1, 13, 18, 5025, 6, 247, 29, 3, 8827, 353, 4, 1221, 4, 26, 459, 45, 3, 119, 1, 8, 2215, 172, 172, 31, 715, 1599, 2, 8, 3246, 1933, 477, 10, 41, 5, 142, 21779, 2, 288, 1272, 2, 118, 72, 5, 10424, 2564, 3365, 4, 7, 89, 212, 60, 5, 329, 2, 1223]",1701.0,29305194,CD34 sup /sup Selection versus Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Unmodified Grafts Allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation Patients Age 50 Years Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome,0,0.0
The bone-marrow niche in MDS and MGUS: implications for AML and MM.,Nature reviews. Clinical oncology,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,2018-01-09,"Several haematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), have well-defined precursor states that precede the development of overt cancer. MM is almost always preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and at least a quarter of all patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have disease that evolves into AML. In turn, MDS are frequently anteceded by clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The acquisition of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations over time clearly influences the increasingly unstable and aggressive behaviour of neoplastic haematopoietic clones; however, perturbations in the bone-marrow microenvironment are increasingly recognized to have key roles in initiating and supporting oncogenesis.

Continued Excellent Outcomes in Previously Untreated Patients With Follicular Lymphoma After Treatment With CHOP Plus Rituximab or CHOP Plus <sup>131</sup>I-Tositumomab: Long-Term Follow-Up of Phase III Randomized Study SWOG-S0016.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2018-01-22,"Purpose SWOG S0016 was a phase III randomized study that compared the safety and efficacy of R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with CHOP-RIT (CHOP followed by consolidation with iodine-133-tositumomab radioimmunotherapy) for previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. Understanding the long-term outcome of patients provides a benchmark for novel treatment regimens for FL. Patients and Methods Between 2001 and 2008, 531 previously untreated patients with FL were randomly assigned to receive either six cycles of R-CHOP or six cycles of CHOP-RIT. Patients with advanced-stage disease (bulky stage II, III, or IV) of any pathologic grade (1, 2, or 3) were eligible. Results After a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 10-year estimates of progression-free and overall survival were 49% and 78% among all patients, respectively. Patients in the CHOP-RIT arm had significantly better 10-year progression-free survival compared with patients in the R-CHOP arm (56% v 42%; P = .01), but 10-year overall survival was not different between the two arms (75% v 81%; P = .13). There was no significant difference between the CHOP-RIT and R-CHOP arms in regard to incidence of second malignancies (15.1% v 16.1%; P = .81) or myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (4.9% v 1.8%; P = .058). The estimated 10-year cumulative incidences of death resulting from second malignancies were not different (7.1% v 3.2%; P = .16), but cumulative incidence of death resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia was higher in the CHOP-RIT arm compared with the R-CHOP arm (4% v 0.9%; P = .02). Conclusion Given these outstanding outcomes, immunochemotherapy should remain the standard induction approach for patients with high-risk FL until long-term follow-up of alternative approaches demonstrates superiority.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",729.0,19.0,Purpose SWOG S0016 phase III randomized compared safety efficacy R-CHOP rituximab plus cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone CHOP-RIT CHOP followed consolidation iodine-133-tositumomab radioimmunotherapy previously untreated patients follicular lymphoma Understanding long-term outcome patients provides benchmark novel treatment regimens FL Patients Methods 2001 2008 531 previously untreated patients FL randomly assigned receive cycles R-CHOP cycles CHOP-RIT Patients advanced-stage disease bulky stage II III IV pathologic grade 1 2 3 eligible median follow-up 10.3 years 10-year estimates progression-free overall survival 49 78 patients respectively Patients CHOP-RIT arm significantly better 10-year progression-free survival compared patients R-CHOP arm 56 v 42 P .01 10-year overall survival different arms 75 v 81 P .13 significant difference CHOP-RIT R-CHOP arms regard incidence second malignancies 15.1 v 16.1 P .81 myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia 4.9 v 1.8 P .058 estimated 10-year cumulative incidences death resulting second malignancies different 7.1 v 3.2 P .16 cumulative incidence death resulting myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia higher CHOP-RIT arm compared R-CHOP arm 4 v 0.9 P .02 Given outstanding outcomes immunochemotherapy remain standard induction approach patients high-risk FL long-term follow-up alternative approaches demonstrates superiority,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 5462, 50825, 10, 8, 124, 316, 384, 45, 17, 72, 3, 367, 2, 209, 1, 668, 2907, 855, 349, 1112, 856, 2132, 2, 1979, 5, 2907, 6313, 2907, 370, 20, 2173, 5, 4287, 5026, 13227, 5862, 9, 373, 1278, 7, 5, 1974, 612, 3, 319, 337, 228, 1, 7, 777, 8, 7330, 9, 229, 24, 472, 9, 2633, 7, 2, 636, 59, 1758, 2, 1375, 11308, 373, 1278, 7, 5, 2633, 11, 1108, 896, 6, 560, 361, 437, 410, 1, 668, 2907, 15, 437, 410, 1, 2907, 6313, 7, 5, 131, 82, 34, 4112, 82, 215, 316, 15, 478, 1, 500, 510, 88, 14, 18, 15, 27, 11, 625, 99, 50, 8, 52, 166, 126, 1, 79, 27, 60, 79, 111, 1423, 1, 91, 115, 2, 63, 25, 11, 739, 2, 833, 107, 62, 7, 106, 7, 4, 3, 2907, 6313, 475, 42, 97, 380, 79, 111, 91, 115, 25, 72, 5, 7, 4, 3, 668, 2907, 475, 664, 603, 595, 19, 355, 84, 79, 111, 63, 25, 10, 44, 338, 59, 3, 100, 1335, 481, 603, 865, 19, 233, 125, 10, 77, 93, 523, 59, 3, 2907, 6313, 2, 668, 2907, 1335, 4, 2539, 6, 287, 1, 419, 441, 167, 14, 603, 245, 14, 19, 865, 15, 681, 15, 286, 533, 39, 83, 603, 14, 66, 19, 10189, 3, 661, 79, 111, 967, 3981, 1, 273, 1113, 29, 419, 441, 11, 44, 338, 67, 14, 603, 27, 18, 19, 245, 84, 967, 287, 1, 273, 1113, 29, 681, 15, 286, 533, 10, 142, 4, 3, 2907, 6313, 475, 72, 5, 3, 668, 2907, 475, 39, 603, 13, 83, 19, 588, 1221, 447, 46, 14565, 123, 10633, 257, 918, 3, 260, 504, 353, 9, 7, 5, 64, 43, 2633, 1100, 319, 337, 166, 126, 1, 1091, 611, 1902, 5233]",1749.0,29356608,Continued Excellent Outcomes Previously Untreated Patients Follicular Lymphoma Treatment CHOP Plus Rituximab CHOP Plus sup 131 /sup I-Tositumomab Long-Term Follow-Up Phase III Randomized SWOG-S0016,1,0.0017452006980802793
Long-term follow-up for up to 5 years on the risk of leukaemic progression in thrombocytopenic patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes treated with romiplostim or placebo in a randomised double-blind trial.,The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2018-01-26,"Treatment options for thrombocytopenia in myelodysplastic syndromes are scarce. As described previously in a randomised phase 2 study (n=250), 58 weeks of romiplostim treatment in patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-defined lower-risk (low-risk or intermediate-1 risk) myelodysplastic syndromes led to reduced platelet transfusions (p<0·0001) and increased International Working Group-defined haematological improvement-platelet rates (p<0·0001) versus placebo. However, the study drug was discontinued because of the potential risk for progression to or incorrect diagnosis or treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia, based on an acute myeloid leukaemia interim hazard ratio (HR) of 2·5; the subsequent 58-week acute myeloid leukaemia HR was 1·2 (95% CI 0·4-3·8). This study is a 5-year follow-up of a phase 2, multicentre, double-blind trial of romiplostim treatment in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Eligible patients were recruited at 109 centres in North America, Europe, Russia, and Australia, were aged 18-90 years, and had platelets of 20 × 10<sup>9</sup> per L or less with or without a history of bleeding or 50 × 10<sup>9</sup> platelets per L or less with a history of bleeding. Patients were randomly assigned by interactive voice response system with stratification by baseline platelet count (≥20 × 10<sup>9</sup> per L or <20 × 10<sup>9</sup> per L) and IPSS risk (low or intermediate-1) to receive either placebo or 750 μg romiplostim subcutaneously once per week for 58 weeks. The primary outcomes for this long-term follow-up were survival and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Progression to acute myeloid leukaemia was defined as either 20% blasts or more after 4 weeks from romiplostim discontinuation; as per pathology; or by initiation of antileukaemia treatment. The primary outcome was assessed per protocol in all patients with available data. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00614523. Patients were recruited from July 21, 2008, to Dec 16, 2010. 167 patients were assigned to receive romiplostim treatment and 83 were assigned to receive placebo. 210 (84%) of 250 patients entered the 5-year long-term follow-up (139 patients in the romiplostim group and 83 in the placebo group). At the end of follow-up, proportions of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (20 [12%] of 167 in the romiplostim group vs nine [11%] of 83 in the placebo group; HR 1·06 [95% CI 0·48-2·33]; p=0·88) and proportions who died (93 [56%] vs 54 [54%]; HR 1·03 [0·72-1·47]; p=0·89) were not significantly different between the two groups. Following the decision to stop the study drug, 5-year long-term follow-up HRs for transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and HRs for death did not differ between patients treated with romiplostim and those treated with placebo, indicating that use of romiplostim is probably not associated with any increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia or death, despite initial concerns.

The poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor niraparib: Management of toxicities.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-02-04,"Niraparib is an oral poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as well as recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the maintenance treatment of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms of action of niraparib include inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity as well as increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes through ""trapping"" the PARP enzyme on damaged DNA. Phase I and III studies have demonstrated activity and benefit of niraparib in both BRCA mutated (BRCAm) and BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) cancers. Phase I testing of niraparib established the maximally tolerated dose of 300mg by mouth (PO) daily, and the phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study demonstrated the benefit of niraparib maintenance therapy compared to placebo after completion of and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in both BRCAm and BRCAwt ovarian cancer patient populations. Toxicities seen with niraparib include hematologic, gastrointestinal, fatigue, and cardiovascular. Hematologic toxicities include thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and leukopenia; upfront dose modification to 200mg niraparib for patients with baseline weight of ≤77kg and/or baseline platelets of ≤150,000K/uL should be considered to avoid significant hematologic toxicity, especially thrombocytopenia, based on recent analyses of the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study.

Secondary Philadelphia chromosome acquired during therapy of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2018-02-14,"The Philadelphia chromosome resulting from t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) or its variants is a defining event in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is also observed in several types of de novo acute leukemia, commonly in B lymphoblastic leukemia, and rarely in acute myeloid leukemia, acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage, and T lymphoblastic leukemia. Acquisition of the Philadelphia chromosome during therapy of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome is rare. We reported 19 patients, including 11 men and 8 women with a median age of 53 years at initial diagnosis. The diagnoses at initial presentation were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 11), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 5), B lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2), and T lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1); no cases carried the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome was detected subsequently at relapse, or at refractory stage of acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Of 14 patients evaluated for the BCR-ABL1 transcript subtype, 12 had the e1a2 transcript. In 11 of 14 patients, the diseases before and after emergence of the Philadelphia chromosome were clonally related by karyotype or shared gene mutations. Of 15 patients with treatment information available, 7 received chemotherapy alone, 5 received chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 2 received tyrosine kinase inhibitors only, and 1 patient was not treated. Twelve patients had follow-up after acquisition of the Philadelphia chromosome; all had persistent/refractory acute leukemia. Thirteen of 15 patients died a median of 3 months after the emergence of the Philadelphia chromosome.

Cancer Res.,2018-02-20,"<b>Purpose:</b> This open-label, multicenter, dose-finding, phase Ib study (NCT01546038) evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the novel Hedgehog pathway Smoothened inhibitor glasdegib (PF-04449913) in patients (<i>N</i> = 52) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).<b>Experimental Design:</b> Glasdegib 100 or 200 mg was administered orally, once daily in 28-day cycles, in combination with low-dose cytarabine (arm A) or decitabine (arm B) to newly diagnosed patients considered not suitable for standard induction chemotherapy, and in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin (arm C) to fit patients. The study followed a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Ten additional patients were enrolled in expansion cohorts of arms A (<i>n</i> = 23) and C (<i>n</i> = 22) to confirm the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).<b>Results:</b> No DLTs were observed in arms A and B; 1 DLT (grade 4 neuropathy) occurred in arm C. The most common treatment-related nonhematologic adverse events were mostly grades 1 and 2 in all arms. Muscle spasms, dysgeusia, and alopecia were generally mild. Overall, 16 patients (31%) achieved a complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery. Note that 100 mg daily was selected as the RP2D for glasdegib in combination with standard chemotherapies in the absence of an estimated MTD in this setting.<b>Conclusions:</b> Treatment with glasdegib in combination with standard chemotherapy was generally well-tolerated and consistent with prior findings, warranting further evaluation of glasdegib-based combinations in patients with AML or high-risk MDS. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(10); 2294-303. ©2018 AACR</i>.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",700.0,26.0,b Purpose /b open-label multicenter dose-finding phase Ib NCT01546038 evaluated safety pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics clinical activity novel Hedgehog pathway Smoothened inhibitor glasdegib PF-04449913 patients N /i 52 acute myeloid leukemia AML high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome MDS b Experimental Design /b Glasdegib 100 200 mg administered orally daily 28-day cycles combination low-dose cytarabine arm decitabine arm B newly diagnosed patients considered suitable standard induction chemotherapy combination cytarabine/daunorubicin arm C fit patients followed standard 3+3 dose-escalation design primary endpoint dose-limiting toxicity DLT additional patients enrolled expansion cohorts arms n /i 23 C n /i 22 confirm recommended phase II dose RP2D b /b DLTs observed arms B 1 DLT grade 4 neuropathy occurred arm C. common treatment-related nonhematologic adverse events grades 1 2 arms Muscle spasms dysgeusia alopecia generally mild Overall 16 patients 31 achieved complete remission CR /CR incomplete blood count recovery Note 100 mg daily selected RP2D glasdegib combination standard chemotherapies absence estimated MTD setting. b Conclusions /b Treatment glasdegib combination standard chemotherapy generally well-tolerated consistent prior findings warranting evaluation glasdegib-based combinations patients AML high-risk MDS Clin Res 24 10 2294-303 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 26, 1020, 1756, 1570, 61, 1567, 124, 3180, 45, 41990, 194, 3, 367, 1159, 3587, 2, 38, 128, 1, 3, 229, 4097, 308, 11990, 230, 15452, 3313, 20054, 4, 7, 70, 78, 70, 653, 5, 286, 533, 329, 15, 64, 43, 681, 1223, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 15452, 394, 15, 1250, 81, 10, 468, 1428, 1059, 391, 4, 339, 218, 410, 4, 150, 5, 154, 61, 1855, 475, 8, 15, 3004, 475, 132, 6, 732, 265, 7, 515, 44, 2884, 9, 260, 504, 56, 2, 4, 150, 5, 1855, 5247, 475, 256, 6, 2975, 7, 3, 45, 370, 8, 260, 27, 27, 61, 1125, 771, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1618, 402, 7, 11, 346, 4, 1422, 736, 1, 1335, 8, 70, 78, 70, 382, 2, 256, 70, 78, 70, 350, 6, 1843, 3, 793, 124, 215, 61, 3977, 132, 99, 132, 77, 2506, 11, 164, 4, 1335, 8, 2, 132, 14, 2059, 88, 39, 1751, 489, 4, 475, 256, 3, 96, 186, 24, 139, 3534, 290, 281, 11, 2754, 2276, 14, 2, 18, 4, 62, 1335, 1502, 18539, 13905, 2, 5691, 11, 1228, 1980, 63, 245, 7, 456, 513, 8, 236, 734, 684, 684, 5, 2610, 315, 1276, 1602, 5739, 17, 394, 81, 391, 10, 715, 22, 3, 3977, 9, 15452, 4, 150, 5, 260, 4203, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 35, 661, 961, 4, 26, 546, 132, 2130, 132, 24, 5, 15452, 4, 150, 5, 260, 56, 10, 1228, 149, 421, 2, 925, 5, 324, 272, 7643, 195, 451, 1, 15452, 90, 1247, 4, 7, 5, 329, 15, 64, 43, 1223, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 259, 79, 39620, 9044, 4281, 1630, 70]",1681.0,29463550,Phase Ib Glasdegib Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor Combination Standard Chemotherapy Patients AML High-Risk MDS,170,0.29668411867364747
Hypomethylating agents in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-02-22,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors, as single-agent therapy, have shown modest clinical efficacy in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). As has been successfully shown in other less immunogenic hematologic malignancies, rationally designed combination approaches may be more effective than single-agent checkpoint inhibitors, and may be the approach to pursue in AML/MDS. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) such as azacitidine, while enhancing anti-tumor immune response, concurrently dampen immune response by upregulating inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule expression. Immune checkpoint molecule upregulation may be an important mechanism of azacitidine resistance. These findings have resulted in multiple clinical trials combining HMAs with immune checkpoint blockade. Clinical trial data have shown encouraging response rates and durable responses without resorting to stem cell transplant. In this review, we discuss preclinical data supporting the use of these agents in combination, and focus on clinical and correlative data emerging from numerous clinical trials investigating HMA-immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations in AML/MDS.",Journal Article,698.0,30.0,Immune checkpoint inhibitors single-agent therapy shown modest clinical efficacy treatment acute myeloid leukemia AML myelodysplastic syndromes MDS successfully shown immunogenic hematologic malignancies rationally designed combination approaches effective single-agent checkpoint inhibitors approach pursue AML/MDS Hypomethylating agents HMAs azacitidine enhancing anti-tumor immune response concurrently dampen immune response upregulating inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule expression Immune checkpoint molecule upregulation important mechanism azacitidine resistance findings resulted multiple clinical trials combining HMAs immune checkpoint blockade Clinical trial shown encouraging response rates durable responses resorting stem transplant review discuss preclinical supporting use agents combination focus clinical correlative emerging numerous clinical trials investigating HMA-immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations AML/MDS,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[250, 986, 222, 22, 226, 420, 36, 47, 443, 1721, 38, 209, 4, 3, 24, 1, 286, 533, 329, 2, 2040, 1223, 22, 71, 85, 1878, 443, 4, 127, 299, 4190, 813, 441, 6352, 1114, 150, 611, 68, 40, 80, 323, 76, 226, 420, 986, 222, 2, 68, 40, 3, 353, 6, 7874, 4, 329, 1223, 4931, 183, 12688, 225, 22, 3752, 369, 2430, 312, 30, 250, 51, 3294, 19142, 250, 51, 20, 12850, 1810, 250, 986, 1354, 55, 250, 986, 1354, 2218, 68, 40, 35, 305, 670, 1, 3752, 251, 46, 272, 47, 627, 4, 232, 38, 143, 1525, 12688, 5, 250, 986, 1189, 38, 160, 74, 47, 443, 2269, 51, 151, 2, 1480, 253, 187, 72274, 6, 452, 31, 941, 4, 26, 206, 21, 1139, 693, 74, 1912, 3, 119, 1, 46, 183, 4, 150, 2, 1222, 23, 38, 2, 3679, 74, 1478, 29, 2331, 38, 143, 3103, 7518, 250, 986, 230, 1247, 4, 329, 1223]",1135.0,29487386,Hypomethylating agents combination immune checkpoint inhibitors acute myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes,1,0.0017452006980802793
<i>Sipa1</i> deficiency-induced bone marrow niche alterations lead to the initiation of myeloproliferative neoplasm.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-03-01,"Mutations of signal-induced proliferation-associated gene 1 (<i>SIPA1</i>), a RAP1 GTPase-activating protein, were reported in patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a childhood myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN). <i>Sipa1</i> deficiency in mice leads to the development of age-dependent MPN. However, <i>Sipa1</i> expression in bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and its effect on the pathogenesis of MPN remain unclear. We here report that <i>Sipa1</i> is expressed in human and mouse BM stromal cells and downregulated in these cells from patients with MPN or MDS/MPN at diagnosis. By using the <i>Sipa1</i><sup>-/-</sup> MPN mouse model, we find that <i>Sipa1</i> deletion causes phenotypic and functional alterations of BM mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells prior to the initiation of the MPN. Importantly, the altered <i>Sipa1</i><sup>-/-</sup> BM niche is required for the development of MDS/MPN following transplantation of normal hematopoietic cells. RNA sequencing reveals an enhanced inflammatory cytokine signaling and dysregulated <i>Dicer1</i>, <i>Kitl</i>, <i>Angptl1</i>, <i>Cxcl12</i>, and <i>Thpo</i> in the <i>Sipa1</i><sup>-/-</sup> BM cellular niches.

"Liposomal Grb2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (BP1001) in patients with refractory or relapsed haematological malignancies: a single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1/1b trial.",The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2018-03-14,"Activating mutations of tyrosine kinases are common in leukaemias. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases use the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) for signal transduction, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1 and MAPK3 (ERK2 and ERK1). We hypothesised that inhibition of Grb2 would suppress ERK1 and ERK2 activation and inhibit leukaemia progression. To inhibit Grb2, a liposome-incorporated antisense oligodeoxynucleotide that blocks Grb2 protein expression, BP1001, was developed. We report the first phase 1 findings of BP1001. In this single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1/1b trial, we enrolled participants (aged ≥18 years) with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia, Philadelphia-chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (in chronic, accelerated, or blast phase), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). We used a 3 + 3 dose escalation strategy, with at least three patients enrolled at each dose level. We administered BP1001 intravenously, twice weekly, for 28 days, with a starting dose of 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. If two or more patients developed toxic effects of grade 3 or higher, that dose level was deemed toxic. The dose was escalated if it did not produce dose-limiting toxic effects, and patients would be sequentially enrolled into cohort 2 (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), cohort 3 (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), cohort 4 (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), cohort 5 (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), or cohort 6 (90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). After completion of monotherapy, we assessed the safety and toxicity of BP1001 (60 or 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with 20 mg low-dose cytarabine (twice-daily subcutaneous injections) in a phase 1b study in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia (ie, those who were refractory to at least one previous therapy regimen and no more than one previous salvage regimen). The objectives of this study were to establish the toxicity and tolerance of escalating doses of BP1001 monotherapy in patients with refractory or relapsed leukaemia, to assess the maximum tolerated dose of BP1001, and to determine the optimal biologically active dose of BP1001, defined as a 50% reduction in Grb2 expression in circulating leukaemia cells. We also aimed to assess the in-vivo pharmacokinetics of BP1001 and tumour response. The study is completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01159028. Between July 23, 2010, and Feb 23, 2016, we enrolled and treated 39 patients, of whom 27 were assessable for dose-limiting toxicity. The first patient treated had mucositis and hand-foot syndrome, which were assessed as possibly related to BP1001 and counted as a dose-limiting toxicity. We noted no other dose-limiting toxicities, and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. The highest tested dose of BP1001 was 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were cardiopulmonary disorders (25 [64%] of 39 patients), and fever (including neutropenic fever) and infections (17 [44%] patients). Grade 5 adverse events were cardiopulmonary disorders (two [5%] of 39 patients), fever (including neutropenic fever) and infections (two [5%] of 39 patients), and multi-organ failure (one [3%] of 39 patients). Nine (33%) of 27 patients who had peripheral blood blasts at the start of therapy had a reduction of 50% or more in peripheral blood blasts while receiving BP1001 montherapy. Three (10%) of 29 patients who had bone marrow blasts at the start of therapy had a reduction in bone marrow blasts of 50% or more while receiving BP1001 monotherapy. Per investigator's assessment, seven (22%) of 32 patients benefited from BP1001 monotherapy and had extended cycles of treatment. Of seven patients receiving BP1001 plus low-dose cytarabine combination therapy, two had complete remission, one had complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, and two had stable disease with no dose-limiting toxicity; one patient died and one withdrew, both because of disease progression. There were eight deaths; none were treatment related. BP1001 is well tolerated, with early evidence of anti-leukaemic activity in combination with low-dose cytarabine. To further explore this anti-leukaemic activity, the efficacy of BP1001 plus low-dose cytarabine combination is being investigated in an ongoing phase 2 study in patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia who are ineligible for intensive induction therapy.

"A Comparison of the Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen Fludarabine/Busulfan with Cyclophosphamide/Total Body Irradiation, for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in the Modern Era: A Cohort Analysis.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-03-16,"With improvement in transplantation practices in the modern era, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved, while disease relapse rates have remained unchanged. Survival outcomes are therefore driven by NRM in the modern era. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens are used to maximize disease control and facilitate engraftment; however, their use is often limited by toxicity. The commonly used MAC regimens incorporate either chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (TBI) or combination chemotherapy. Furthermore, reduced-toxicity myeloablative (RTM) regimens, such as fludarabine/busulfan (FluBu), have emerged as alternatives to traditional MAC and their impact on outcomes in the current era have not been fully investigated. In this study, we compare outcomes following HSCT, using the chemotherapy only RTM MAC regimens FluBu with the chemoradiotherapy regimen cyclophosphamide/TBI (CyTBI), for patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent MAC HSCT at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We hypothesized that the chemotherapy-only regimen would fare better, primarily due to improved NRM. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on 387 patients with myeloid or lymphoid hematologic malignancies who underwent HLA-matched related (8/8), matched unrelated (8/8), or single-antigen mismatched unrelated (7/8) HSCT following myeloablative conditioning. Patients received FluBu (n = 158) or CyTBI (n = 229). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and all other outcomes were regarded as secondary. A subset analysis was performed for patients <55 years of age and for acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients of age <55 years. For the whole cohort, 3-year OS was similar for FluBu compared with CyTBI in unadjusted analysis. However, in multivariable analysis, FluBu resulted in superior OS compared with CyTBI (3-year adjusted estimate: 65% versus 55%, respectively; HR for death, .62; 95% CI, .40 to .97; P = .036). While relapse rates were similar between the 2 regimens, NRM and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (grade II to IV) were significantly worse with CyTBI compared with FluBu. Rates of chronic GVHD were similar between 2 regimens. These results were consistent in a subset of patients <55 years of age and in acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients below 55 years of age. The RTM chemotherapy-only regimen FluBu appears to be as effective and more tolerable than the chemoradiotherapy regimen CyTBI, leading to better OS driven by better NRM.

RNA cytosine methylation and methyltransferases mediate chromatin organization and 5-azacytidine response and resistance in leukaemia.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2018-03-21,"The roles of RNA 5-methylcytosine (RNA:m<sup>5</sup>C) and RNA:m<sup>5</sup>C methyltransferases (RCMTs) in lineage-associated chromatin organization and drug response/resistance are unclear. Here we demonstrate that the RCMTs, namely NSUN3 and DNMT2, directly bind hnRNPK, a conserved RNA-binding protein. hnRNPK interacts with the lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs), GATA1 and SPI1/PU.1, and with CDK9/P-TEFb to recruit RNA-polymerase-II at nascent RNA, leading to formation of 5-Azacitidine (5-AZA)-sensitive chromatin structure. In contrast, NSUN1 binds BRD4 and RNA-polymerase-II to form an active chromatin structure that is insensitive to 5-AZA, but hypersensitive to the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 and to the downregulation of NSUN1 by siRNAs. Both 5-AZA-resistant leukaemia cell lines and clinically 5-AZA-resistant myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia specimens have a significant increase in RNA:m<sup>5</sup>C and NSUN1-/BRD4-associated active chromatin.

Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia With Fibrosis Is a Distinct Disease Subset With Myeloproliferative Features and Frequent JAK2 p.V617F Mutations.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2018-06-01,"A subset of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) presents with significance myelofibrosis. In myelodysplastic syndromes, significant myelofibrosis has been associated with adverse outcomes and p53 dysregulation. However, in CMML the clinical and molecular correlates of significant myelofibrosis at presentation remain poorly understood. From a cohort of 651 CMML patients, we identified retrospectively 20 (3.1%) cases with moderate to severe reticulin fibrosis (CMML-F) detected at diagnosis, and we compared them to CMML patients without fibrosis (n=631) seen during the same period. Patients with CMML-F had a median age of 69.8 years (range, 24.8 to 91.2 y) and most (13; 65%) were men. Patients with CMML-F differed significantly from other CMML patients across the following parameters: white blood count, absolute monocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, splenomegaly, and bone marrow blast percentage. Notably, the frequency of JAK2 p.V617F mutation was higher in CMML-F patients compared with other CMML patients (P<0.001). Most CMML-F patients (12/20; 60%) had myeloproliferative CMML. Dysregulation of p53 was uncommon in CMML-F. CMML-F patients tended to have a shorter median overall survival compared with other CMML patients (P=0.079). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed an independent association between CMML-F and overall survival (P=0.047). In summary, unlike typical CMML, CMML-F is commonly associated with JAK2 p.V617F. The high frequency of myeloproliferative features and JAK2 p.V617F mutation, and the low frequency of p53 dysregulation, suggest that fibrosis in the context of CMML has a different pathogenesis from that previously reported in myelodysplastic syndrome.",Comparative Study,599.0,10.0,subset patients chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML presents significance myelofibrosis myelodysplastic syndromes significant myelofibrosis associated adverse outcomes p53 dysregulation CMML clinical molecular correlates significant myelofibrosis presentation remain poorly understood cohort 651 CMML patients identified retrospectively 20 3.1 cases moderate severe reticulin fibrosis CMML-F detected diagnosis compared CMML patients fibrosis n=631 seen period Patients CMML-F median age 69.8 years range 24.8 91.2 13 65 men Patients CMML-F differed significantly CMML patients following parameters white blood count absolute monocyte count serum lactate dehydrogenase level splenomegaly bone marrow blast percentage Notably frequency JAK2 p.V617F higher CMML-F patients compared CMML patients P 0.001 CMML-F patients 12/20 60 myeloproliferative CMML Dysregulation p53 uncommon CMML-F.

Exome chip analyses identify genes affecting mortality after HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation.,Blood,Blood,2018-04-02,"Although survival outcomes have significantly improved, up to 40% of patients die within 1 year of HLA-matched unrelated-donor blood and marrow transplantation (BMT). To identify non-HLA genetic contributors to mortality after BMT, we performed the first exome-wide association study in the DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts using the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip. This study includes 2473 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome and 2221 10/10 HLA-matched donors treated from 2000 to 2011. Single-variant and gene-level analyses were performed on overall survival (OS), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), and disease-related mortality (DRM). Genotype mismatches between recipients and donors in a rare nonsynonymous variant of testis-expressed gene <i>TEX38</i> significantly increased risk of TRM, which was more dramatic when either the recipient or donor was female. Using the SKAT-O test to evaluate gene-level effects, variant genotypes of <i>OR51D1</i> in recipients were significantly associated with OS and TRM.

Characterization of IDH1 p.R132H Mutant Clones Using Mutation-specific Antibody in Myeloid Neoplasms.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2018-05-01,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations occur in a variety of myeloid neoplasms. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based direct visualization of mutant clones of hematopoietic cells can be useful for rapid diagnostic screening and for monitoring treatment response. In this study, we first evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the IDH1 p.R132H mutation-specific antibody by IHC. All IDH1 wild type cases (n=11) and IDH1 mutant cases with a non-p.R132H mutation (n=30) were negative by IHC, demonstrating 100% antibody specificity. All the initial diagnostic specimens with IDH1 p.R132H mutation including acute myeloid leukemia (n=30), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (n=10), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (n=4), and MPN (n=5) were positive by IHC, demonstrating 100% antibody sensitivity. Both immature and mature myeloid cells showed immunoreactivity. Erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts were consistently negative by IHC. We then evaluated the follow-up specimens with a known IDH1 mutation status including acute myeloid leukemia (n=23), MDS (n=2), MDS/MPN (n=2), and MPN (n=2). Thirty-three IDH1 p.R132H mutant cases were positive by IHC and 12 IDH1 mutation negative cases were negative by IHC. However, IHC reactivity in up to 25% of bone marrow cells was noted in 8 of 20 polymerase chain reaction-negative cases, all from patients with a known history of IDH1 p.R132H mutation indicating sampling error or a sensitivity issue with molecular tests. These data indicate that IHC is a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect IDH1 p.R132H mutation in bone marrow involved by myeloid neoplasms. In addition, IDH1 p.R132H IHC also allows localization and assessment of the maturation stage of the clones carrying the mutation.",Journal Article,630.0,2.0,Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 IDH1 IDH2 occur variety myeloid neoplasms Immunohistochemistry IHC -based direct visualization clones hematopoietic useful rapid diagnostic screening monitoring treatment response evaluated sensitivity specificity IDH1 p.R132H mutation-specific antibody IHC IDH1 wild type cases n=11 IDH1 cases non-p.R132H n=30 negative IHC demonstrating 100 antibody specificity initial diagnostic specimens IDH1 p.R132H including acute myeloid leukemia n=30 myelodysplastic syndromes MDS n=10 MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms MPN n=4 MPN n=5 positive IHC demonstrating 100 antibody sensitivity immature mature myeloid showed immunoreactivity Erythroid precursors lymphoid endothelial osteoblasts consistently negative IHC evaluated follow-up specimens known IDH1 status including acute myeloid leukemia n=23 MDS n=2 MDS/MPN n=2 MPN n=2 Thirty-three IDH1 p.R132H cases positive IHC 12 IDH1 negative cases negative IHC IHC reactivity 25 bone marrow noted 8 20 polymerase chain reaction-negative cases patients known history IDH1 p.R132H indicating sampling error sensitivity issue molecular tests indicate IHC highly specific sensitive tool detect IDH1 p.R132H bone marrow involved myeloid neoplasms addition IDH1 p.R132H IHC allows localization assessment maturation stage clones carrying,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5795, 2374, 14, 2662, 2, 4520, 138, 1271, 4, 8, 1362, 1, 533, 1179, 888, 1289, 90, 1196, 6234, 1, 620, 2749, 1, 1007, 37, 122, 40, 999, 9, 1321, 752, 453, 2, 9, 1315, 24, 51, 4, 26, 45, 21, 157, 194, 3, 485, 2, 1121, 1, 3, 2662, 19, 9312, 258, 112, 548, 20, 1289, 62, 2662, 955, 267, 140, 78, 175, 2, 2662, 620, 140, 5, 8, 220, 19, 9312, 258, 78, 201, 11, 199, 20, 1289, 2219, 394, 548, 1121, 62, 3, 388, 752, 623, 5, 2662, 19, 9312, 258, 141, 286, 533, 78, 201, 2040, 1223, 78, 79, 1223, 10857, 1179, 4125, 78, 39, 2, 4125, 78, 33, 11, 109, 20, 1289, 2219, 394, 548, 485, 110, 5733, 2, 2908, 533, 37, 224, 4900, 7839, 4881, 2303, 37, 845, 37, 2, 5965, 11, 2433, 199, 20, 1289, 21, 818, 194, 3, 166, 126, 623, 5, 8, 440, 2662, 258, 156, 141, 286, 533, 78, 382, 1223, 78, 18, 1223, 4125, 78, 18, 2, 4125, 78, 18, 977, 169, 2662, 19, 9312, 620, 140, 11, 109, 20, 1289, 2, 133, 2662, 258, 199, 140, 11, 199, 20, 1289, 137, 1289, 4601, 4, 126, 6, 243, 1, 581, 37, 10, 1051, 4, 66, 1, 179, 1451, 1260, 1329, 199, 140, 62, 29, 7, 5, 8, 440, 532, 1, 2662, 19, 9312, 258, 1716, 2874, 3444, 15, 8, 485, 2537, 5, 219, 895, 46, 74, 1008, 17, 1289, 16, 8, 561, 112, 2, 745, 1515, 6, 1426, 2662, 19, 9312, 258, 4, 581, 646, 20, 533, 1179, 4, 352, 2662, 19, 9312, 1289, 120, 2333, 2145, 2, 455, 1, 3, 4537, 82, 1, 3, 2749, 2934, 3, 258]",1693.0,29635257,Characterization IDH1 p.R132H Clones Mutation-specific Antibody Myeloid Neoplasms,0,0.0
"Final results of a phase 2, open-label study of indisulam, idarubicin, and cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.",Cancer,Cancer,2018-04-16,"Indisulam possesses anticancer properties through down-regulation of various cell-cycle checkpoint molecules, thereby blocking the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and inducing p53 and p21. Indisulam exhibits synergy with nucleoside analogs and topoisomerase inhibitors. The authors designed a phase 2 study of indisulam in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients who had relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. In stage 1, patients received intravenous indisulam at 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle. If they had no response, then patients received same dose schedule of indisulam followed by intravenous idarubicin 8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily for 3 days and cytarabine 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> over 24 hours daily on days 9 through 12 (for those aged < 60 years) or days 9 through 11 (for those aged > 60 years) of a 28-day cycle. Primary endpoints included the overall response rate, and secondary objectives included overall survival. Forty patients were enrolled. Of the 37 evaluable patients, 31 received indisulam with chemotherapy. Of these, 11 (35%) responded for a median duration of 5.3 months. The estimated 1-year overall survival rate was 51% for responders compared with 8 % for nonresponders (P < .001). The most common grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicities were electrolyte abnormalities (50%) and febrile neutropenia (28%). The combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine yielded a 35% response rate in heavily pretreated patients with AML. With emerging data identifying the expression of DCAF15 (DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 15) as a potential biomarker for activity, the combination of indisulam with idarubicin and cytarabine should be studied in a biomarker-driven trial or in patients who have splicing factor mutations.

Graft-versus-host disease in recipients of male unrelated donor compared with parous female sibling donor transplants.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-05-01,"Optimal donor selection is critical for successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Donor sex and parity are well-established risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with male donors typically associated with lower rates of GVHD. Well-matched unrelated donors (URDs) have also been associated with increased risks of GVHD as compared with matched sibling donors. These observations raise the question of whether male URDs would lead to more (or less) favorable transplant outcomes as compared with parous female sibling donors. We used the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry to complete a retrospective cohort study in adults with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, who underwent T-cell replete HCT from these 2 donor types (parous female sibling or male URD) between 2000 and 2012. Primary outcomes included grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), and overall survival. Secondary outcomes included disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse. In 2813 recipients, patients receiving male URD transplants (n = 1921) had 1.6 times higher risk of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD (<i>P</i> < .0001). For cGVHD, recipient sex was a significant factor, so donor/recipient pairs were evaluated.

Micafungin versus posaconazole prophylaxis in acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: A randomized study.,The Journal of infection,J. Infect.,2018-05-07,"To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of micafungin versus posaconazole during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in acute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients with AL or MDS undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to open-label micafungin 100 mg intravenously daily or posaconazole suspension 400 mg orally twice daily until neutrophil recovery, up to 28 days. Patients were followed for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was prophylaxis failure (premature discontinuation due to infection, intolerance, adverse event, or death). Time to failure and survival were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. From March 2011 to May 2016, 113 patients who received at least 2 doses of prophylaxis were analyzed (58 patients randomized to micafungin and 55 to posaconazole). Prophylaxis failure occurred in 34.5% and 52.7% of patients on micafungin and posaconazole, respectively (P = 0.0118). The median number of days on prophylaxis was 16 [interquartile range (IQR) 12-20] for micafungin and 13 [IQR 6-16] for posaconazole (P = 0.01). Micafungin failures were largely due to antifungal treatment; posaconazole failures were mostly due to gastrointestinal intolerance or adverse effects.

The interleukin-3 receptor CD123 targeted SL-401 mediates potent cytotoxic activity against CD34<sup>+</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup> cells from acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients and healthy donors.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2018-05-17,"Diseases with clonal hematopoiesis such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia have high rates of relapse. Only a small subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients are cured with chemotherapy alone. Relapse in these diseases occurs at least in part due to the failure to eradicate leukemic stem cells or hematopoietic stem cells in myelodysplastic syndrome. CD123, the alpha chain of the interleukin-3 receptor heterodimer, is expressed on the majority of leukemic stem cells and myelodysplastic syndrome hematopoietic stem cells and in 80% of acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we report indiscriminate killing of CD123<sup>+</sup> normal and acute myeloid leukemia / myelodysplastic syndrome cells by SL-401, a diphtheria toxin interleukin-3 fusion protein. SL-401 induced cytotoxicity of CD123<sup>+</sup> primary cells/blasts from acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients but not CD123<sup>-</sup> lymphoid cells. Importantly, SL-401 was highly active even in cells expressing low levels of CD123, with minimal effect on modulation of the CD123 target in acute myeloid leukemia. SL-401 significantly prolonged survival of leukemic mice in acute myeloid leukemia patient-derived xenograft mouse models. In addition to primary samples, studies on normal cord blood and healthy marrow show that SL-401 has activity against normal hematopoietic progenitors.

Consequences of mutant TET2 on clonality and subclonal hierarchy.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-05-24,"Somatic mutations in TET2 are common in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative, and overlap syndromes. TET2 mutant (TET2<sup>MT</sup>) clones are also found in asymptomatic elderly individuals, a condition referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). In various entities of TET2<sup>MT</sup> neoplasia, we examined the phenotype in relation to the strata of TET2 hits within the clonal hierarchy. Using deep sequencing, 1781 mutations were found in 1205 of 4930 patients; 40% of mutant cases were biallelic. Hierarchical analysis revealed that of TET2<sup>MT</sup> cases >40% were ancestral, e.g., representing 8% of MDS. Higher (earlier) TET2 lesion rank within the clonal hierarchy (greater clonal burden) was associated with impaired survival. Moreover, MDS driven by ancestral TET2<sup>MT</sup> is likely derived from TET2<sup>MT</sup> CHIP with a penetrance of ~1%. Following ancestral TET2 mutations, individual disease course is determined by secondary hits. Using multidimensional analyses, we demonstrate how hits following the TET2 founder defect induces phenotypic shifts toward dysplasia, myeloproliferation, or progression to AML.

"Quizartinib, an FLT3 inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia: an open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2018-05-31,"Old age and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia are associated with early relapse and poor survival. Quizartinib is an oral, highly potent, and selective next-generation FLT3 inhibitor with clinical antileukaemic activity in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent quizartinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. We did an open-label, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at 76 hospitals and cancer centres in the USA, Europe, and Canada. We enrolled patients with morphologically documented primary acute myeloid leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndromes and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 into two predefined, independent cohorts: patients who were aged 60 years or older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia within 1 year after first-line therapy (cohort 1), and those who were 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory disease following salvage chemotherapy or haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (cohort 2). Patients with an FLT3-ITD allelic frequency of more than 10% were considered as FLT3-ITD positive, whereas all other patients were considered as FLT3-ITD negative. Patients received quizartinib once daily as an oral solution; the initial 17 patients received 200 mg per day but the QTcF interval was prolonged for more than 60 ms above baseline in some of these patients. Subsequently, doses were amended for all patients to 135 mg per day for men and 90 mg per day for women. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a composite complete remission (defined as complete remission + complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery + complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery) and the proportion of patients who achieved a complete remission. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of quizartinib (ie, the intention-to-treat population). Patients with a locally assessed post-treatment bone marrow aspirate or biopsy were included in efficacy analyses by response; all other patients were considered to have an unknown response. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00989261, and with the European Clinical Trials Database, EudraCT 2009-013093-41, and is completed. Between Nov 19, 2009, and Oct 31, 2011, a total of 333 patients were enrolled (157 in cohort 1 and 176 in cohort 2). In cohort 1, 63 (56%) of 112 FLT3-ITD-positive patients and 16 (36%) of 44 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission, with three (3%) FLT3-ITD-positive patients and two (5%) FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieving complete remission. In cohort 2, 62 (46%) of 136 FLT3-ITD-positive patients achieved composite complete remission with five (4%) achieving complete remission, whereas 12 (30%) of 40 FLT3-ITD-negative patients achieved composite complete remission with one (3%) achieving complete remission. Across both cohorts (ie, the intention-to-treat population of 333 patients), grade 3 or worse treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (76 [23%] of 333), anaemia (75 [23%]), thrombocytopenia (39 [12%]), QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) prolongation (33 [10%]), neutropenia (31 [9%]), leucopenia (22 [7%]), decreased platelet count (20 [6%]), and pneumonia (17 [5%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (126 [38%] of 333; 76 treatment related), acute myeloid leukaemia progression (73 [22%]), pneumonia (40 [12%]; 14 treatment related), QTcF prolongation (33 [10%]; 32 treatment related), sepsis (25 [8%]; eight treatment related), and pyrexia (18 [5%]; nine treatment related). Notable serious adverse events occurring in less than 5% of patients were torsades de pointes (one [<1%]) and hepatic failure (two [1%]). In total, 125 (38%) of 333 patients died within the study treatment period, including the 30-day follow-up. 18 (5%) patients died because of an adverse event considered by the investigator to be treatment related (ten [6%] of 157 patients in cohort 1 and eight [5%] of 176 in cohort 2. Single-agent quizartinib was shown to be highly active and generally well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, particularly those with FLT3-ITD mutations. These findings confirm that targeting the FLT3-ITD driver mutation with a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor is a promising clinical strategy to help improve clinical outcomes in patients with very few options. Phase 3 studies (NCT02039726; NCT02668653) will examine quizartinib at lower starting doses.

Case Report of Myeloid Sarcoma Masquerading as In-Transit Metastasis at a Previous Melanoma Site: Avoiding a Diagnostic Pitfall.,The American Journal of dermatopathology,Am J Dermatopathol,2018-11-01,"Myeloid sarcoma is a rare extramedullary hematologic malignancy. Accurate and timely diagnosis may be challenging because myeloid sarcoma is known to mimic solid tumors, including hepatobiliary, nasopharyngeal, and breast carcinomas. We report a case of myeloid sarcoma that developed in the primary tumor lymphatic drainage field of a previously treated intermediate-thickness cutaneous melanoma, clinically and radiographically mimicking an in-transit metastasis, in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was achieved after surgical excision of the mass and pathological examination that included extensive immunohistochemical studies.

CC-486 Maintenance after Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-06-20,"Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Injectable azacitidine can improve post-transplant outcomes but presents challenges with exposure and compliance. Oral CC-486 allows extended dosing to prolong azacitidine activity. We investigated use of CC-486 maintenance therapy after alloSCT. Adults with MDS or AML in morphologic complete remission at CC-486 initiation (42 to 84 days after alloSCT) were included. Patients received 1 of 4 CC-486 dosing schedules per 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. Endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence, relapse/progression rate, and survival. Of 30 patients, 7 received CC-486 once daily for 7 days per cycle (200 mg, n = 3; 300 mg, n = 4) and 23 for 14 days per cycle (150 mg, n = 4; 200 mg, n = 19 [expansion cohort]). Grades 3 to 4 adverse events were infrequent and occurred with similar frequency across regimens. Standard concomitant medications did not alter CC-486 pharmacokinetic parameters. Three patients (10%) experienced grade III acute GVHD and 9 experienced chronic GVHD. Of 28 evaluable patients, 6 (21%) relapsed or had progressive disease: 3 of 7 patients (43%) who had received 7-day dosing and 3 of 23 (13%) who had received 14-day dosing. Transplant-related mortality was 3%. At 19 months of follow-up, median overall survival was not reached. Estimated 1-year survival rates were 86% and 81% in the 7-day and 14-day dosing cohorts, respectively.

Paramount therapy for young and fit patients with mantle cell lymphoma: strategies for front-line therapy.,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-07-13,"The natural history of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a continuous process with the vicious cycle of remission and recurrence. Because MCL cells are most vulnerable before their exposure to therapeutic agents, front-line therapy could eliminate MCL cells at the first strike, reduce the chance for secondary resistance, and cause long-term remissions. If optimized, it could become an alternative to cure MCL. The key is the intensity of front-line therapy. Both the Nordic 2 and the MD Anderson Cancer Center HCVAD trials, with follow-up times greater than 10 years, achieved long-term survivals exceeding 10 years. But the Achilles heel in both trials were the severe toxicities, such as secondary malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes /leukemia. Therefore, intensive therapies can act as a double-edged sword providing long term survival at the cost of severe toxicities. In our opinion, although intensive chemotherapy can cause detrimental side effects, it is indispensable given that we run the risk of sacrificing long-term survivals in these young and fit patients. We must seek for a powerful alternative at the front-line. Furthermore, minimal residual disease negativity should be the optimal therapeutic goal to achieve before and after autologous stem cell transplantation. Some novel therapeutic strategies have shown to improve outcomes, but it is not yet clear as to how these results translate in population. Of note, MCL patients need to be stratified at diagnosis and be provided with different intensities of front-line regimen. In this review, we discuss current strategies for the treatment of young patients with newly diagnosed MCL.",Journal Article,557.0,0.0,natural history mantle lymphoma MCL continuous process vicious cycle remission recurrence MCL vulnerable exposure therapeutic agents front-line therapy eliminate MCL strike reduce chance secondary resistance cause long-term remissions optimized alternative cure MCL key intensity front-line therapy Nordic 2 MD Anderson Center HCVAD trials follow-up times greater 10 years achieved long-term survivals exceeding 10 years Achilles heel trials severe toxicities secondary malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes /leukemia intensive therapies act double-edged sword providing long term survival cost severe toxicities opinion intensive chemotherapy cause detrimental effects indispensable given run risk sacrificing long-term survivals young fit patients seek powerful alternative front-line Furthermore minimal residual disease negativity optimal therapeutic goal achieve autologous stem transplantation novel therapeutic strategies shown improve outcomes clear translate population note MCL patients need stratified diagnosis provided different intensities front-line regimen review discuss current strategies treatment young patients newly diagnosed MCL,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1504, 532, 1, 2757, 31, 1308, 16, 8, 1314, 1129, 5, 3, 21300, 417, 1, 734, 2, 146, 408, 1308, 37, 32, 96, 5017, 348, 136, 645, 6, 189, 183, 3007, 328, 36, 359, 4964, 1308, 37, 28, 3, 157, 38317, 969, 3, 3477, 9, 568, 251, 2, 708, 319, 337, 3166, 492, 4039, 192, 359, 1417, 35, 1091, 6, 1722, 1308, 3, 825, 16, 3, 837, 1, 3007, 328, 36, 110, 3, 20680, 18, 2, 3, 2244, 1929, 12, 574, 14372, 143, 5, 166, 126, 1072, 378, 76, 79, 60, 513, 319, 337, 3794, 5178, 79, 60, 84, 3, 21442, 24994, 4, 110, 143, 11, 3, 905, 385, 225, 22, 568, 441, 141, 2040, 2647, 673, 1686, 235, 122, 2559, 22, 8, 1627, 73234, 73235, 1736, 319, 337, 25, 28, 3, 835, 1, 905, 385, 4, 114, 3564, 242, 1686, 56, 122, 708, 6227, 1152, 176, 192, 16, 13338, 447, 17, 21, 7726, 3, 43, 1, 14886, 319, 337, 3794, 4, 46, 1169, 2, 2975, 7, 21, 1642, 6606, 9, 8, 3757, 1091, 28, 3, 3007, 328, 798, 1048, 753, 34, 6014, 257, 40, 3, 665, 189, 1326, 6, 1359, 348, 2, 50, 1028, 452, 31, 497, 476, 229, 189, 422, 47, 443, 6, 401, 123, 84, 192, 16, 44, 1145, 885, 22, 6, 832, 46, 99, 4509, 4, 266, 1, 5739, 1308, 7, 594, 6, 40, 1173, 28, 147, 2, 40, 1052, 5, 338, 11565, 1, 3007, 328, 477, 4, 26, 206, 21, 1139, 291, 422, 9, 3, 24, 1, 1169, 7, 5, 732, 265, 1308]",1612.0,30005678,Paramount therapy young fit patients mantle lymphoma strategies front-line therapy,3,0.005235602094240838

Molecular analyses uncovered germline SAMD9L (n = 4) or SAMD9 (n = 1) mutations in these families. Affected individuals had a highly variable clinical course that ranged from mild and transient dyspoietic changes in the bone marrow to a rapid progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7. Expression of these gain-of-function SAMD9 and SAMD9L mutations reduces cell cycle progression, and deep sequencing demonstrated selective pressure favoring the outgrowth of clones that have either lost the mutant allele or acquired revertant mutations.

Validation of the 2017 revision of the WHO chronic myelomonocytic leukemia categories.,Blood advances,Blood Adv,2018-08-01,"The 2017 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification includes substantial changes to the subclassification of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML): (1) a 3-tiered blast-based scheme including a novel ""CMML-0"" category replacing a 2-tiered system in place since 2001 and (2) 2 CMML subtypes, myelodysplastic (MDS-CMML) and myeloproliferative (MP-CMML), based on a white blood cell count cutoff of 13 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The clinical utility of this subclassification scheme, particularly the expansion of blast-based subgroups, has not been validated. In this study, a large single-institution CMML patient cohort (n = 629) was used to assess the prognostic impact of the newly proposed categories. Patients were risk stratified according to the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS) and the MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System. MP-CMML patients had significantly shorter overall survival (OS; <i>P</i> < .0001; hazard ratio: 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.65) and median duration to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation (<i>P</i> < .0001; 15.2 vs 22.0 months) compared with MDS-CMML patients. The CMML-0 group included 36.4% patients with higher risk CPSS categories and 11.2% of patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Among treatment-naïve patients (n = 499), there was a marginal difference in OS between the CMML-0 and CMML-1<sup>2017</sup> subgroups (<i>P</i> = .0552). The WHO 2017 blast-based categories were not associated with AML-free survival. Incorporation of the WHO 2017 blast-based subgroups in a modified CPSS scheme had a neutral effect and did not improve its prognostic strength.

Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, we found risks for AML/MDS in HL, NHL and PCM to be 5-10 times the background rate. In contrast, relative risks were 10-50 for AML and approximately 100 for MDS in the autotransplant cohort.

Glasdegib in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin in patients with AML or high-risk MDS: Phase 2 study results.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2018-09-09,"Glasdegib is a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor. This ongoing, open-label, phase 2 study (NCT01546038) evaluated glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin in patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Patients received glasdegib 100 mg orally, once daily in continuous 28-day cycles from day -3, with intravenous cytarabine 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-7 and daunorubicin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1-3. Patients in remission then received consolidation therapy (2-4 cycles of cytarabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily on days 1, 3, 5 of each cycle), followed by maintenance glasdegib (maximum 6 cycles). Primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) in patients aged ≥55 years. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), safety and outcome by mutational status. Patients had a median (range) age of 64.0 (27-75) years, 60.0% were male, and 84.5% were white. In 69 evaluable patients, 46.4% (80% confidence interval [CI]: 38.7-54.1) achieved investigator-reported CR. Among patients ≥55 years old (n = 60), 40.0% (80% CI 31.9-48.1) achieved CR. Among all 69 patients, median OS was 14.9 (80% CI 13.4-19.3) months, with 12-month survival probability 66.6% (80% CI 58.5-73.4). The most common treatment-related adverse events (≥50% patients) were diarrhea and nausea. There were no significant associations between mutational status (12 genes) and clinical response, suggesting potential benefit across diverse molecular profiles. Glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin was well tolerated and associated with clinical activity in patients with untreated AML or high-risk MDS. A randomized phase 3 trial of glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy (7 + 3 schedule) is ongoing.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",499.0,22.0,Glasdegib Hedgehog pathway inhibitor ongoing open-label phase 2 NCT01546038 evaluated glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin patients untreated acute myeloid leukemia AML high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes MDS Patients received glasdegib 100 mg orally daily continuous 28-day cycles day -3 intravenous cytarabine 100 mg/m sup 2 /sup days 1-7 daunorubicin 60 mg/m sup 2 /sup days 1-3 Patients remission received consolidation therapy 2-4 cycles cytarabine 1 g/m sup 2 /sup twice daily days 1 3 5 cycle followed maintenance glasdegib maximum 6 cycles Primary endpoint complete remission CR patients aged ≥55 years Secondary endpoints included overall survival OS safety outcome status Patients median range age 64.0 27-75 years 60.0 male 84.5 white 69 evaluable patients 46.4 80 confidence interval CI 38.7-54.1 achieved investigator-reported CR patients ≥55 years old n 60 40.0 80 CI 31.9-48.1 achieved CR 69 patients median OS 14.9 80 CI 13.4-19.3 months 12-month survival probability 66.6 80 CI 58.5-73.4 common treatment-related adverse events ≥50 patients diarrhea nausea significant associations status 12 clinical response suggesting potential benefit diverse molecular profiles Glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin tolerated associated clinical activity patients untreated AML high-risk MDS randomized phase 3 trial glasdegib combination chemotherapy 7 3 schedule ongoing,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[15452, 16, 8, 4097, 308, 230, 26, 942, 1020, 1756, 124, 18, 45, 41990, 194, 15452, 349, 1855, 5247, 4, 7, 5, 1278, 286, 533, 329, 15, 64, 43, 2040, 1223, 7, 103, 15452, 394, 81, 1428, 1059, 391, 4, 1314, 339, 218, 410, 29, 218, 27, 5, 1262, 1855, 394, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 23, 162, 14, 67, 2, 5247, 335, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 23, 162, 14, 27, 7, 4, 734, 818, 103, 2173, 36, 18, 39, 410, 1, 1855, 14, 499, 188, 172, 18, 172, 936, 391, 23, 162, 14, 27, 33, 1, 296, 417, 370, 20, 1146, 15452, 689, 49, 410, 86, 1138, 10, 236, 734, 684, 4, 7, 1032, 15425, 60, 568, 1387, 159, 63, 25, 118, 367, 2, 228, 20, 1619, 156, 7, 42, 8, 52, 184, 89, 1, 660, 13, 428, 481, 60, 335, 13, 11, 1045, 2, 874, 33, 11, 886, 4, 790, 859, 7, 641, 39, 493, 307, 268, 58, 519, 67, 667, 14, 513, 3464, 210, 684, 107, 7, 15425, 60, 1095, 78, 335, 327, 13, 493, 58, 456, 83, 576, 14, 513, 684, 107, 62, 790, 7, 52, 118, 10, 213, 83, 493, 58, 233, 39, 326, 27, 53, 5, 133, 811, 25, 1320, 700, 49, 493, 58, 717, 33, 803, 39, 3, 96, 186, 24, 139, 290, 281, 5660, 7, 11, 1172, 2, 1218, 125, 11, 77, 93, 685, 59, 1619, 156, 133, 214, 2, 38, 51, 802, 174, 247, 716, 1867, 219, 1241, 15452, 349, 1855, 5247, 10, 149, 421, 2, 41, 5, 38, 128, 4, 7, 5, 1278, 329, 15, 64, 43, 1223, 8, 384, 124, 27, 160, 1, 15452, 4, 150, 5, 56, 67, 27, 1055, 16, 942]",1624.0,30074259,Glasdegib combination cytarabine daunorubicin patients AML high-risk MDS Phase 2,0,0.0
Upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease adds minimal prognostic value in isolation or with other graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease symptoms as currently diagnosed and treated.,Haematologica,Haematologica,2018-08-03,"Upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease is reported in approximately 30% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients developing acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease. Currently classified as Grade II in consensus criteria, upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease is often treated with systemic immunosuppression. We reviewed the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database to assess the prognostic implications of upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease in isolation or with other acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease manifestations. 8567 adult recipients of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant receiving T-cell replete grafts for acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. 51% of transplants were from unrelated donors. Reported upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease incidence was 12.1%; 2.7% of recipients had isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease, of whom 95% received systemic steroids. Patients with isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement had similar survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse as patients with Grades 0, I, or II acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease. Unrelated donor recipients with isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease had less subsequent chronic graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease than those with Grades I or II disease (<i>P</i>=0.016 and <i>P</i>=0.0004, respectively). Upper gastrointestinal involvement added no significant prognostic information when present in addition to other manifestations of Grades I or II acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease. If upper gastrointestinal symptoms were reclassified as Grade 0 or I, 425 of 2083 patients (20.4%) with Grade II disease would be downgraded, potentially impacting the interpretation of clinical trial outcomes. Defining upper gastrointestinal acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease as a Grade II entity, as it is currently diagnosed and treated, is not strongly supported by this analysis. The general approach to diagnosis, treatment and grading of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and their impact on subsequent acute graft-<i>versus</i>-host disease therapy warrants reevaluation.",Journal Article,536.0,0.0,Upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease reported approximately 30 hematopoietic stem transplant recipients developing acute graft- versus /i -host disease Currently classified Grade II consensus criteria upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease treated systemic immunosuppression reviewed Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research database assess prognostic implications upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease isolation acute graft- versus /i -host disease manifestations 8567 adult recipients myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplant receiving T-cell replete grafts acute leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome 2000 2012 51 transplants unrelated donors Reported upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease incidence 12.1 2.7 recipients isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease 95 received systemic steroids Patients isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement similar survival disease-free survival transplant-related mortality relapse patients Grades 0 II acute graft- versus /i -host disease Unrelated donor recipients isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease subsequent chronic graft- versus /i -host disease Grades II disease P /i =0.016 P /i =0.0004 respectively Upper gastrointestinal involvement added significant prognostic information present addition manifestations Grades II acute graft- versus /i -host disease upper gastrointestinal symptoms reclassified Grade 0 425 2083 patients 20.4 Grade II disease downgraded potentially impacting interpretation clinical trial outcomes Defining upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease Grade II entity currently diagnosed treated strongly supported general approach diagnosis treatment grading upper gastrointestinal symptoms impact subsequent acute graft- versus /i -host disease therapy warrants reevaluation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 16, 210, 4, 705, 201, 1, 1007, 452, 31, 941, 2190, 931, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 694, 1373, 22, 88, 215, 4, 1391, 371, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 16, 629, 73, 5, 403, 3646, 21, 446, 3, 574, 9, 944, 315, 2, 581, 941, 389, 609, 6, 423, 3, 177, 1268, 1, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 4, 5019, 15, 5, 127, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 4282, 73365, 780, 2190, 1, 3246, 1063, 1007, 452, 31, 941, 357, 102, 31, 11151, 4713, 9, 286, 442, 533, 15, 681, 59, 1081, 2, 1195, 11, 311, 725, 1, 4016, 11, 29, 2092, 2344, 210, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 287, 10, 133, 14, 18, 67, 1, 2190, 42, 1355, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 1, 953, 48, 103, 403, 4580, 7, 5, 1355, 1726, 799, 42, 288, 25, 34, 115, 25, 941, 139, 282, 2, 429, 22, 7, 5, 2276, 13, 70, 15, 215, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 2092, 1488, 2190, 5, 1355, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 42, 299, 706, 442, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 76, 135, 5, 2276, 70, 15, 215, 34, 70, 19, 70, 13, 3820, 2, 70, 19, 70, 13, 5295, 106, 1726, 799, 1953, 77, 93, 177, 487, 198, 364, 4, 352, 6, 127, 4282, 1, 2276, 70, 15, 215, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 492, 1726, 507, 11, 7864, 22, 88, 13, 15, 70, 8544, 1, 49723, 7, 179, 39, 5, 88, 215, 34, 688, 40, 16006, 751, 8661, 3, 3037, 1, 38, 160, 123, 2847, 1726, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 22, 8, 88, 215, 2983, 22, 192, 16, 694, 265, 2, 73, 16, 44, 1327, 2708, 20, 26, 65, 3, 1083, 353, 6, 147, 24, 2, 3452, 1, 1726, 507, 2, 136, 345, 23, 706, 286, 1599, 70, 185, 70, 1204, 34, 36, 2782, 15828]",2120.0,30076185,Upper gastrointestinal acute graft- versus /i -host disease adds minimal prognostic value isolation graft- versus /i -host disease symptoms currently diagnosed treated,0,0.0
Association Between Renal Cell Carcinoma and Myelodysplastic Syndromes: Epigenetic Underpinning?,Clinical genitourinary cancer,Clin Genitourin Cancer,2018-06-28,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain myeloid malignancies are both characterized by widespread aberrant DNA hypermethylation. After clinical observations of patients with a personal history of both malignancies, we sought to explore a potential association, and to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. Mayo Clinic's 'Advanced Cohort Explorer' database was used to identify patients with a history of both malignancies. Clinical features and long-term outcome were abstracted. Prevalence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in patients ≥ 65 years with a personal history of nephrectomy for RCC was then compared with the prevalence of MDSs in the Dusseldorf MDS registry and the general patient population at Mayo Clinic, using 1-sample test of proportions. A total of 59 patients with a diagnosis of both RCC and myeloid malignancy were identified. The myeloid malignancies included 38 MDSs, 12 acute myelogenous leukemia, and 9 myeloproliferative neoplasms. The cohort was characterized by marked male predominance (4.4:1). The median age at RCC diagnosis was 64 years (range, 37-87 years), and for myeloid malignancy was 75 years (range, 44-90 years).

Cladribine and low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine as front-line therapy for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukaemia: a phase 2 single-arm trial.,The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2018-08-13,"Front-line therapy for elderly or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) remains unsatisfactory with poor outcomes and excessive toxicity. We studied a new low-intensity regimen of cladribine combined with low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine, aimed at improving outcomes in this population. Based on our previous experience, we hypothesised that this combination would be safe and more effective than current approaches with hypomethylating agents. In this single-arm, open-label, single-centre phase 2 study, we enrolled patients aged 60 years or older with previously untreated AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who had adequate organ function and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less. Patients were treated with cladribine plus low-dose cytarabine for two 28-day cycles alternating with decitabine for two 28-day cycles, for up to 18 cycles. Induction therapy (cycle 1) consisted of cladribine 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously over 1-2 h on days 1-5 and cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-10. Patients who had remission during this induction regimen moved on to consolidation therapy (cladribine 5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously over 1-2 h on days 1-3 and cytarabine 20 mg twice daily on days 1-10, alternating with decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1-5). The primary outcome measure was disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, proportion of patients achieving complete response, proportion of patients achieving response, toxicity, and induction mortality. All treated patients were included in the analyses. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515527. Between Feb 17, 2012, and July 6, 2017, 118 patients were enrolled and treated, among whom 48 (41%) had an adverse karyotype, 20 (17%) had therapy-related AML, 18 (15%) had treated secondary AML, and 20 (17%) had TP53 mutations. Median disease-free survival was 10·8 months (IQR 5·4-25·9). 80 (68%) patients achieved objective response: 69 (58%) achieved a complete response and 11 (9%) patients had complete response with incomplete count recovery. The median overall survival was 13·8 months (6·9-28·6). The regimen was well tolerated, with one (1%) death within the first 4 weeks and eight (7%) deaths within the first 8 weeks. The most common non-haematological adverse events of grade 3 or worse were infection (88 [75%] patients), elevated total bilirubin (26 [22%] patients), rash (13 [11%] patients), and nausea (13 [11%] patients). The combination of cladribine and low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine appears to be a safe and highly effective regimen for the treatment of elderly or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML. Further testing of this regimen is warranted, and could help to provide a new, effective option for reduced-intensity therapy in this population.

Comparative Analysis of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Based Methotrexate and Mycophenolate Mofetil-Containing Regimens for Prevention of Graft-versus-Host Disease after Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Transplantation.,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-08-25,"The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) such as tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine (CYSP) with methotrexate (MTX) or with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been commonly used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), but there are limited data comparing efficacy of the 2 regimens. We evaluated 1564 adult patients who underwent RIC alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 2000 to 2013 using HLA-identical sibling (matched related donor [MRD]) or unrelated donor (URD) peripheral blood graft and received CYSP or TAC with MTX or MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. Primary outcomes of the study were acute and chronic GVHD and overall survival (OS). The study divided the patient population into 4 cohorts based on regimen: MMF-TAC, MMF-CYSP, MTX-TAC, and MTX-CYSP. In the URD group, MMF-CYSP was associated with increased risk of grade II to IV acute GVHD (relative risk [RR], 1.78; P < .001) and grade III to IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.93; P = .006) compared with MTX-TAC. In the URD group, use of MMF-TAC (versus MTX-TAC) lead to higher nonrelapse mortality. (hazard ratio, 1.48; P = .008). In either group, no there was no difference in chronic GVHD, disease-free survival, and OS among the GVHD prophylaxis regimens. For RIC alloHCT using MRD, there are no differences in outcomes based on GVHD prophylaxis. However, with URD RIC alloHCT, MMF-CYSP was inferior to MTX-based regimens for acute GVHD prevention, but all the regimens were equivalent in terms of chronic GVHD and OS.

Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities of rhabdomyolysis (grade 4), hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3), and oral herpes (grade 3) with the day 1 and 8 schedule. Otherwise, adverse events mainly consisted of gastrointestinal manifestations (n = 11), febrile neutropenia/infections (n = 4), pulmonary toxicity (n = 2), and renal failure (n = 2). The most common laboratory abnormalities observed were an increase in creatinine (93%) and anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (100%). Overall, 33 of 42 patients (79%) had reduction in blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. One patient achieved a partial response and 2 patients a morphologic leukemia-free state. Most (n = 30, 71%) were discontinued due to progressive disease. Early deaths occurred from disease-related causes that were not attributable to lurbinectedin. Four patients with a chromosome 11q21-23 abnormality had significantly greater bone marrow blast reduction than those without such abnormality, with decrease of 31 ± 14% (n = 4) vs 8 ± 8% (n = 16), respectively (P = .04). Overall, lurbinectedin was safe and tolerated using the schedules and dose levels tested.

Characteristics and Predictors for Secondary Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome in Ewing and Osteosarcoma Survivors.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-08-28,"Long-term survivors of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma may be at risk for therapy-related acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AL/MDS). We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 1071 patients with osteosarcoma (n = 757) and ES (n = 314) who were treated between 1985 and 2014. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to analyze predictors of t-AL/MDS, including a radiation dose (≥55.8 Gy vs <55.8 Gy) × disease site (pelvis/spine vs other) interaction term. A supplemental nested case-control study was conducted to assess the association between cumulative chemotherapy dose and t-AL/MDS. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 97 months (range, 0.03-380). Twenty patients developed t-AL/MDS, all of whom received chemotherapy and 15 of whom were treated with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to ≥55.8 Gy was associated with development of t-AL/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-6.80; P = .015), and there was a significant radiation dose × disease site interaction term (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.71-16.53; P<sub>interaction</sub> < .001).

In our nested case-control study, cumulative doses of ifosfamide and etoposide were associated with development of t-AL/MDS.

Phase I study of ruxolitinib in previously treated patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome with evidence of NF-kB activation.,Leukemia research,Leuk. Res.,2018-09-14,"Therapeutic options for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have failed prior therapies are limited particularly after hypomethylating agent. Several studies have indicated that deregulation of innate immunity signaling is critical in the pathogenesis of MDS. This process involves Toll-like receptor stimulation, cytokine overexpression, and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. Since ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, suppresses NF-kB expression, we conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation. Nineteen patients, 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 11 with MDS, were enrolled. No dose limiting toxicity was observed and the maximum tolerated dose was 20 mg twice daily. Responses were restricted to MDS patients with an overall response rate of 22% [hematological improvement in platelets (HI-P) = 2, hematological improvement in erythrocytes (HI-E) = 1, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) = 1]. Of these patients, 2 relapsed (HI-P and PCyR) and 2 continue to be in HI-P and HI-E, respectively, with ongoing therapy. Meaningful improvement in bone marrow dysplasia was only seen in a patient who achieved HI-E. Phosphorylated p65 (pp65) decreased in 6 of 15 patients (40%) including the 2 patients with continued response to treatment and increased in a patient who relapsed after a short-lived HI-P. This suggests potential correlation between reduction in pp65 expression and response duration. In conclusion, ruxolitinib was well-tolerated in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation and resulted in low but significant frequency of responses.

STAT3 overexpression was predictive of a shorter survival and worse clinical features in a large MDS cohort. High STAT3 expression signature in MDS CD34+ cells was similar to known preleukemic gene signatures. Functionally, STAT3 inhibition by a clinical, antisense oligonucleotide, AZD9150, led to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in leukemic cell lines. AZD9150 was rapidly incorporated by primary MDS/AML stem and progenitor cells and led to increased hematopoietic differentiation. STAT3 knockdown also impaired leukemic growth in vivo and led to decreased expression of MCL1 and other oncogenic genes in malignant cells.

A number of questions remain unanswered in this emerging field, including the ideal diagnostic approach for patients at risk for HHMs, the optimal surveillance of unaffected carriers, and how to personalize care for individuals with HHMs. The field of HHMs is evolving rapidly. Ongoing research in this area will eventually inform the care of patients with both somatic and hereditary cancer syndromes, but much work remains to be done.",Journal Article,416.0,5.0,review diagnosis individuals hereditary hematopoietic malignancies HHMs predispose myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia barriers HHM diagnosis unaddressed questions controversies HHM field Pathogenic germline approximately dozen predispose HHMs likely involved HHM identified recently HHM phenotypes diverse categorized `` purely '' myeloid syndromes syndromes abnormal platelet number/function HHMs additional organ involvement number questions remain unanswered emerging field including ideal diagnostic approach patients risk HHMs optimal surveillance unaffected carriers personalize care individuals HHMs field HHMs evolving rapidly Ongoing research area eventually inform care patients somatic hereditary syndromes work remains,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 206, 3, 147, 1, 869, 5, 2305, 1007, 441, 24337, 17, 6043, 6, 681, 2, 286, 533, 2160, 6, 36676, 147, 2, 29248, 1937, 2, 6613, 262, 3, 36676, 1067, 2806, 1009, 138, 4, 705, 8, 20512, 214, 6043, 6, 24337, 2, 445, 80, 214, 32, 322, 6, 40, 646, 445, 1, 46, 36676, 214, 47, 158, 85, 108, 761, 36676, 2618, 32, 1867, 84, 68, 40, 2320, 22, 13033, 522, 533, 2040, 2040, 5, 1668, 1596, 207, 343, 2, 24337, 5, 402, 1259, 398, 799, 8, 207, 1, 1937, 918, 7550, 4, 26, 1478, 1067, 141, 3, 3662, 752, 353, 9, 7, 28, 43, 9, 24337, 3, 665, 617, 1, 4585, 1316, 2, 832, 6, 8346, 165, 9, 869, 5, 24337, 3, 1067, 1, 24337, 16, 3276, 1755, 942, 389, 4, 26, 965, 303, 3124, 2295, 3, 165, 1, 7, 5, 110, 1119, 2, 2305, 12, 2040, 84, 1802, 1357, 469, 6, 40, 1822]",1021.0,30259338,Hereditary Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia Diagnosis Questions Controversies,13,0.02268760907504363
"Peripheral Blood versus Bone Marrow from Unrelated Donors: Bone Marrow Allografts Have Improved Long-Term Overall and Graft-versus-Host Disease-Free, Relapse-Free Survival.",Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.,2018-10-03,"Peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from unrelated donors can serve as a graft source for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Currently, PB is most commonly used in roughly 80% of adult recipients. Determining the long-term impact of graft source on outcomes would inform this decision. Data collected by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 5200 adult recipients of a first HCT from an 8/8 or 7/8 HLA antigen-matched unrelated donor for treatment of acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2001 and 2011 were analyzed to determine the impact of graft source on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) relapse-free survival (GRFS), defined as freedom from grade III/IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy, relapse, and death, and overall survival. GRFS at 2 years was superior in BM recipients compared with PB recipients (16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14% to 18% versus 10%; 95% CI, 8% to 11%; P <.0001) in the 8/8 HLA-matched cohort and 7/8 HLA-matched cohort (11%; 95% CI, 8% to 14% versus 5%; 95% CI, 4% to 7%; P = .001). With 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donors, overall survival at 5 years was superior in recipients of BM (43%; 95% CI, 40% to 46% versus 38%; 95% CI, 36% to 40%; P = .014). The inferior 5-year survival in the PB cohort was attributable to a higher frequency of deaths while in remission compared with the BM cohort. For recipients of 7/8 HLA-matched grafts, survival at 5 years was similar in BM recipients and PB recipients (32% versus 29%; P = .329). BM grafts are associated with improved long-term GRFS and overall survival in recipients of matched unrelated donor HCT and should be considered the unrelated allograft of choice, when available, for adults with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.",Clinical Trial,475.0,2.0,Peripheral blood PB bone marrow BM unrelated donors serve graft source hematopoietic transplantation HCT Currently PB commonly roughly 80 adult recipients Determining long-term impact graft source outcomes inform decision collected Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research 5200 adult recipients HCT 8/8 7/8 HLA antigen-matched unrelated donor treatment acute leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome 2001 2011 determine impact graft source graft-versus-host disease GVHD relapse-free survival GRFS defined freedom grade III/IV acute GVHD chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy relapse death overall survival GRFS 2 years superior BM recipients compared PB recipients 16 95 confidence interval CI 14 18 versus 10 95 CI 8 11 P .0001 8/8 HLA-matched cohort 7/8 HLA-matched cohort 11 95 CI 8 14 versus 5 95 CI 4 7 P .001 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donors overall survival 5 years superior recipients BM 43 95 CI 40 46 versus 38 95 CI 36 40 P .014 inferior 5-year survival PB cohort attributable higher frequency deaths remission compared BM cohort recipients 7/8 HLA-matched grafts survival 5 years similar BM recipients PB recipients 32 versus 29 P .329 BM grafts associated improved long-term GRFS overall survival recipients matched unrelated donor HCT considered unrelated allograft choice available adults acute leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[672, 315, 3767, 2, 581, 1246, 29, 2092, 2344, 122, 1833, 22, 8, 1599, 2353, 9, 1007, 31, 497, 1085, 694, 3767, 16, 96, 841, 95, 4, 7954, 493, 1, 780, 2190, 2196, 3, 319, 337, 345, 1, 1599, 2353, 23, 123, 688, 2295, 26, 948, 74, 786, 20, 3, 574, 9, 944, 315, 2, 581, 941, 389, 29, 73743, 780, 2190, 1, 8, 157, 1085, 29, 35, 66, 66, 15, 67, 66, 1160, 448, 655, 2092, 1488, 9, 24, 1, 286, 442, 2194, 15, 681, 59, 1758, 2, 1132, 11, 311, 6, 223, 3, 345, 1, 1599, 2353, 23, 1599, 185, 1204, 34, 1562, 429, 115, 25, 36678, 395, 22, 3060, 29, 88, 316, 478, 286, 1562, 442, 1562, 1888, 2989, 36, 429, 2, 273, 2, 63, 25, 36678, 28, 18, 60, 10, 1123, 4, 1246, 2190, 72, 5, 3767, 2190, 245, 48, 307, 268, 58, 213, 6, 203, 185, 79, 48, 58, 66, 6, 175, 19, 488, 4, 3, 66, 66, 1160, 655, 180, 2, 67, 66, 1160, 655, 180, 175, 48, 58, 66, 6, 213, 185, 33, 48, 58, 39, 6, 67, 19, 144, 5, 66, 66, 1160, 655, 2092, 2344, 63, 25, 28, 33, 60, 10, 1123, 4, 2190, 1, 1246, 601, 48, 58, 327, 6, 641, 185, 519, 48, 58, 511, 6, 327, 19, 3618, 3, 1663, 33, 111, 25, 4, 3, 3767, 180, 10, 2971, 6, 8, 142, 675, 1, 1043, 369, 4, 734, 72, 5, 3, 1246, 180, 9, 2190, 1, 67, 66, 1160, 655, 4713, 25, 28, 33, 60, 10, 288, 4, 1246, 2190, 2, 3767, 2190, 531, 185, 462, 19, 8766, 1246, 4713, 32, 41, 5, 231, 319, 337, 36678, 2, 63, 25, 4, 2190, 1, 655, 2092, 1488, 1085, 2, 257, 40, 515, 3, 2092, 9568, 1, 1866, 198, 390, 9, 857, 5, 286, 442, 2194, 2, 681]",1707.0,30292009,Peripheral Blood versus Bone Marrow Unrelated Donors Bone Marrow Allografts Improved Long-Term Overall Graft-versus-Host Disease-Free Relapse-Free Survival,5,0.008726003490401396
A phase II study of omacetaxine mepesuccinate for patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia after failure of hypomethylating agents.,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2018-11-15,"The outcome of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) after failure of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) failure is poor with a median overall survival (OS) of only 4-6 months. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM) is safe and effective in myeloid malignancies but has not been studied in MDS with HMA failure. We conducted a phase II study of OM in patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who had previously failed or been intolerant to HMAs. Patients received OM at a dose of 1.25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously every 12 hours for 3 consecutive days on a 4- to 7-week schedule. The primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and OS. A total of 42 patients were enrolled with a median age of 76 years. The ORR was 33%. Patients with diploid cytogenetics were more likely to respond to OM than were those with cytogenetic abnormalities (58% vs 23%, respectively; P = .03). Overall, the median OS was 7.5 months and 1-year OS rate was 25%. Patients with diploid cytogenetics had superior OS to those with cytogenetic abnormalities (median OS 14.8 vs 6.8 months, respectively; P = .01). Two patients had ongoing response to OM of 2 years or longer (both MDS with diploid cytogenetics and RUNX1 mutation). The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were infections in 11 patients (26%), febrile neutropenia in 4 (10%), and hemorrhage in 3 (7%). Overall, OM was safe and active in patients with MDS or CMML who experienced HMA failure. These results support the further development of OM in this setting.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",432.0,0.0,outcome patients myelodysplastic syndromes MDSs failure hypomethylating agents HMAs failure poor median overall survival OS 4-6 months Omacetaxine mepesuccinate OM safe effective myeloid malignancies studied MDS HMA failure conducted phase II OM patients MDS chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML previously failed intolerant HMAs Patients received OM dose 1.25 mg/m sup 2 /sup subcutaneously 12 hours 3 consecutive days 4- 7-week schedule primary endpoints overall response rate ORR OS total 42 patients enrolled median age 76 years ORR 33 Patients diploid cytogenetics likely respond OM cytogenetic abnormalities 58 vs 23 respectively P .03 Overall median OS 7.5 months 1-year OS rate 25 Patients diploid cytogenetics superior OS cytogenetic abnormalities median OS 14.8 vs 6.8 months respectively P .01 patients ongoing response OM 2 years longer MDS diploid cytogenetics RUNX1 common grade ≥ 3 adverse events infections 11 patients 26 febrile neutropenia 4 10 hemorrhage 3 7 Overall OM safe active patients MDS CMML experienced HMA failure support development OM setting,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 228, 1, 7, 5, 2040, 13550, 50, 496, 1, 4931, 183, 12688, 496, 16, 334, 5, 8, 52, 63, 25, 118, 1, 158, 39, 49, 53, 15787, 35902, 7435, 16, 1165, 2, 323, 4, 533, 441, 84, 71, 44, 85, 656, 4, 1223, 5, 7518, 496, 21, 426, 8, 124, 215, 45, 1, 7435, 4, 7, 5, 1223, 15, 442, 5451, 3382, 54, 42, 373, 1551, 15, 85, 4944, 6, 12688, 7, 103, 7435, 28, 8, 61, 1, 14, 243, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 3928, 454, 133, 1459, 9, 27, 935, 162, 23, 8, 39, 6, 67, 647, 1055, 3, 86, 1387, 11, 3, 63, 51, 116, 1735, 2, 118, 8, 181, 1, 595, 7, 11, 346, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 846, 60, 3, 1735, 10, 466, 7, 5, 6815, 2510, 11, 80, 322, 6, 1892, 6, 7435, 76, 11, 135, 5, 1266, 1171, 717, 105, 382, 106, 19, 680, 63, 3, 52, 118, 10, 67, 33, 53, 2, 14, 111, 118, 116, 10, 243, 7, 5, 6815, 2510, 42, 1123, 118, 6, 135, 5, 1266, 1171, 52, 118, 213, 66, 105, 49, 66, 53, 106, 19, 355, 100, 7, 42, 942, 51, 6, 7435, 1, 18, 60, 15, 589, 110, 1223, 5, 6815, 2510, 2, 6092, 258, 3, 96, 186, 88, 749, 27, 290, 281, 11, 1875, 4, 175, 7, 432, 2498, 778, 4, 39, 79, 2, 3599, 4, 27, 67, 63, 7435, 10, 1165, 2, 544, 4, 7, 5, 1223, 15, 3382, 54, 592, 7518, 496, 46, 99, 538, 3, 195, 193, 1, 7435, 4, 26, 546]",1445.0,30328139,phase II omacetaxine mepesuccinate patients higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome chronic myelomonocytic leukemia failure hypomethylating agents,0,0.0
PPM1D Mutations Drive Clonal Hematopoiesis in Response to Cytotoxic Chemotherapy.,Cell stem cell,Cell Stem Cell,2018-11-01,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in which stem cell clones dominate blood production, becomes increasingly common with age and can presage malignancy development. The conditions that promote ascendancy of particular clones are unclear. We found that mutations in PPM1D (protein phosphatase Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent 1D), a DNA damage response regulator that is frequently mutated in CH, were present in one-fifth of patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and strongly correlated with cisplatin exposure. Cell lines with hyperactive PPM1D mutations expand to outcompete normal cells after exposure to cytotoxic DNA damaging agents including cisplatin, and this effect was predominantly mediated by increased resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, heterozygous mutant Ppm1d hematopoietic cells outcompeted their wild-type counterparts in vivo after exposure to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not during recovery from bone marrow transplantation. These findings establish the clinical relevance of PPM1D mutations in CH and the importance of studying mutation-treatment interactions.

A single institutional review of pediatric Bacillus spp. bloodstream infections demonstrates increased incidence among children with cancer.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2018-12-11,"Bacillus species are known to cause severe infection in immunocompromised hosts. The incidence of Bacillus bloodstream infections and characteristics of infection among children with cancer or indication for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is unknown. We performed a retrospective medical record review of all cases of Bacillus bacteremia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital. We report average incidences from 2012 to 2014. We performed a detailed review of infections among children with cancer or undergoing HCT and a case-control study to evaluate whether neutropenia at diagnosis caries higher risk of Bacillus infection for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One hundred fourteen children developed Bacillus bacteremia during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 0.27/1,000 patients. Among children treated for cancer or undergoing HCT, there were 37 bloodstream infections (2.0/1,000 patients). Of the 37 oncology/HCT patients, oncologic diagnoses included ALL (18), acute myeloid leukemia (3), myelodysplastic syndrome (1), solid tumors (8), and 7 children were undergoing HCT. The incidence of infection among children with ALL was 34/1,000 patients and all central nervous system (CNS) infections (6) and deaths (3) occurred in this population.

Biol.,,"In the past few years, our improved understanding of the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has led to remarkable advances in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for these diseases. This chapter summarizes the available clinical data with immune-based therapeutic modalities in AML and MDS, focusing on monoclonal antibodies, T cell engager antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, and checkpoint blockade via blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4. Numerous clinical trials are currently ongoing in patients with AML and MDS, both in the frontline and relapsed refractory setting. Given the natural diversity of AML blasts, it became apparent that the best responses would be achieved with rationally designed combination strategies of immune therapy, molecular therapy, and chemotherapy.

Randomized comparison of low dose cytarabine with or without glasdegib in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2018-12-16,"Glasdegib is a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor. This phase II, randomized, open-label, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01546038) evaluated the efficacy of glasdegib plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. Glasdegib 100 mg (oral, QD) was administered continuously in 28-day cycles; LDAC 20 mg (subcutaneous, BID) was administered for 10 per 28 days. Patients (stratified by cytogenetic risk) were randomized (2:1) to receive glasdegib/LDAC or LDAC. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Eighty-eight and 44 patients were randomized to glasdegib/LDAC and LDAC, respectively. Median (80% confidence interval [CI]) overall survival was 8.8 (6.9-9.9) months with glasdegib/LDAC and 4.9 (3.5-6.0) months with LDAC (hazard ratio, 0.51; 80% CI, 0.39-0.67, P = 0.0004). Fifteen (17.0%) and 1 (2.3%) patients in the glasdegib/LDAC and LDAC arms, respectively, achieved complete remission (P < 0.05). Nonhematologic grade 3/4 all-causality adverse events included pneumonia (16.7%) and fatigue (14.3%) with glasdegib/LDAC and pneumonia (14.6%) with LDAC.

Novel EZH2 mutation in a patient with secondary B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia after deletion 5q myelodysplastic syndrome treated with lenalidomide: A case report.,Medicine,Medicine (Baltimore),2019-01-01,"The gene deletion (5)(q22q35) is reported in 10-20% of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases and is associated with response to lenalidomide and favorable prognosis. The authors report here a clinical case of MDS transformation to B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) with an associated accrual of an additional mutation following treatment with lenalidomide. A 69-year-old man presented with progressive anemia, normal white blood cell count, and thrombocytopenia consistent with MDS. He was administered lenalidomide for 27 months, then developed acute B-cell lymphocytic leukemia and acquired a previously unreported mutation in the gene enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). After 27 months of therapy with lenalidomide, a surveillance bone marrow aspiration (BMA) revealed 90% cellularity with persistent multilineage dysplasia and a population of blasts comprising 54% of all bone marrow elements by morphology, consistent with B-ALL, even though the patient was asymptomatic. Conventional karyotype showed no signs of del(5)(q22q35) MDS, however bone marrow next-generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated the accrual of a nonsense mutation (c.211del pL71*) in exon 3 of EZH2. A confirmatory BMA yielded 70% blasts and clinical features indicative of B-ALL. Mini-hyper-CVD (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone at 50% dose reduction, no anthracycline, methotrexate at 75% dose reduction, cytarabine at 0.5 g/m × 4 doses) was administered for 21 days. A follow-up BMA was performed 2 months after mini-hyper-CVD therapy, showing dysplastic features with 25% ring sideroblasts, but no evidence of B-ALL. The patient is currently receiving monthly-low dose decitabine, ofatumumab, and dexamethasone, and is transfusion independent and asymptomatic after 7 cycles. The present study shows an extremely rare progression of del(5)(q22q35) MDS to B-ALL with accompanying NGS data and a newly described acquisition of an EZH2 frameshift mutation.

"Mutation, drift and selection in single-driver hematologic malignancy: Example of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome following treatment of inherited neutropenia.",PLoS computational biology,PLoS Comput. Biol.,2019-01-07,"Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30-40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline ELANE mutation. Acquired mutations in CSF3R occur in >70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an ELANE mutation causes SCN; CSF3R mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with CSF3R truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the CSF3R truncation mutation.

The role of TGFβ in hematopoiesis and myeloid disorders.,Leukemia,Leukemia,2019-02-28,"The role of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling in embryological development and tissue homeostasis has been thoroughly characterized. Its canonical downstream cascade is well known, even though its true complexity and other non-canonical pathways are still being explored. TGFβ signaling has been described as an important pathway involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In the hematopoietic compartment, the TGFβ pathway is an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation of different cell types and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a diverse variety of bone marrow disorders. Due to its importance in hematological diseases, novel inhibitors of this pathway are being developed against a number of hematopoietic disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this review, we provide an overview of the TGFβ pathway, focusing on its role in hematopoiesis and impact on myeloid disorders.

"Gait speed, grip strength, and clinical outcomes in older patients with hematologic malignancies.",Blood,Blood,2019-06-05,"This study aimed to evaluate whether gait speed and grip strength predicted clinical outcomes among older adults with blood cancers. We prospectively recruited 448 patients aged 75 years and older presenting for initial consultation at the myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia, myeloma, or lymphoma clinic of a large tertiary hospital, who agreed to assessment of gait and grip. A subset of 314 patients followed for ≥6 months at local institutions was evaluated for unplanned hospital or emergency department (ED) use. We used Cox proportional hazard models calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival, and logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for hospital or ED use. Mean age was 79.7 (± 4.0 standard deviation) years. After adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, cognition, treatment intensity, and cancer aggressiveness/type, every 0.1-m/s decrease in gait speed was associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29), odds of unplanned hospitalizations (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.16-1.51), and ED visits (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.17-1.53). Associations held among patients with good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 or 1). Every 5-kg decrease in grip strength was associated with worse survival (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43) but not hospital or ED use. A model with gait speed and all covariates had comparable predictive power to comprehensive validated frailty indexes (phenotype and cumulative deficit) and all covariates.

"Idarubicin, cytarabine, and nivolumab in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome: a single-arm, phase 2 study.",The Lancet. Haematology,Lancet Haematol,2019-08-07,"Outcomes for younger patients with acute myeloid leukaemia have moderately improved over the past two decades owing to better supportive care and recent introduction of novel targeted agents. Blocking PD-1 and its ligand's pathways enhances antileukaemia responses by enabling T cells in murine models. We aimed to assess the addition of nivolumab to frontline therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. This single-arm, phase 2 part of the phase 1-2 study of nivolumab in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Eligible patients were aged 18-60 years (or >60 years if suitable for intensive chemotherapy), and had newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Induction included cytarabine 1·5 g/m<sup>2</sup> by 24-h continuous infusion daily on days 1-4 (3 days in patients >60 years) and idarubicin 12 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily on days 1-3. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was started on day 24 (range 22-26) and continued every 2 weeks for up to a year in responders. Responders received either up to five consolidation cycles of attenuated doses of idarubicin and cytarabine, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation if eligible. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival and overall survival. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02464657. Between Aug 7, 2015, and June 2, 2018, 44 patients were enrolled of whom 22 (50%) had adverse genetic risk by European Leukaemia Network classification. All patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. At a median follow-up of 17·25 months (IQR 0·50-30·40), median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI 7·93-NR). Median relapse-free survival of responders was 18·54 months (95% CI 8·20-23·22). The median overall survival was 18·54 months (95% CI 10·81-28·81). Six patients had seven grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events with two cases of rash, two of colitis, and one each of transaminitis, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis. 19 (43%) of 44 patients achieved a response and proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, with grade 3-4 graft-versus-host disease observed in five (26%). No treatment related deaths were attributed to nivolumab. Addition of nivolumab to induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Post-transplant severe graft-versus-host disease could be improved, and earlier initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy is warranted in future studies.
