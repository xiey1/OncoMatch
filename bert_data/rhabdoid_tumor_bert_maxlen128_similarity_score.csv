"Highly penetrant, rapid tumorigenesis through conditional inversion of the tumor suppressor gene Snf5.",Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2002-11-01,"Recent data suggest the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex may also act as a tumor suppressor. Utilizing a reversibly inactivating conditional allele, we demonstrate that loss of Snf5/Ini1/Baf47/SmarcB1, a core subunit of SWI/SNF, results in highly penetrant cancer predisposition with 100% of mice developing mature CD8(+) T cell lymphoma or rare rhabdoid tumors with a median onset of only 11 weeks. Notably, while loss of Snf5 predisposes to aggressive cancers, it is also required for survival of virtually all nonmalignant cells in vivo.

Recent advances in pediatric renal neoplasia.,Advances in anatomic pathology,Adv Anat Pathol,2003-09-01,"Over the past 6 years, molecular genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of pediatric renal neoplasms. The cellular variant of congenital mesoblastic nephroma (but not the classic variant) has been shown to bear the same t(12;15)(p13;q25) and ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion as infantile fibrosarcoma, a tumor with which it shares morphologic and clinical features. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is characterized by deletion of the hSNF5/INI1 gene, which links it to other rhabdoid tumors of infancy that arise in the soft tissue and brain. Primary renal synovial sarcomas and renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors have become accepted entities, and likely comprise a subset of what had previously been termed ""adult Wilms tumor."" Renal carcinomas associated with Xp11.2 translocations that result in fusions involving the TFE3 transcription factor gene have been delineated, including a distinctive neoplasm that shares the identical gene fusion as alveolar soft part sarcoma. Most recently, a distinctive type of renal neoplasm with a t(6;11)(p21;q12) has been described, and the cloning of the resulting gene fusion links it to the Xp11 translocation carcinomas.

Clin. Oncol.,2005-03-01,"To describe clinical features, therapeutic approaches, and prognostic factors in pediatric patients with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). Primary tumor samples from patients diagnosed with ATRT at SJCRH between July 1984 and June 2003 were identified. Pathology review included histologic, immunohistochemical analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for SMARCB1 (also known as hSNF5/INI1) deletion. Clinical records of patients with pathologic confirmation of ATRT were reviewed. Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with ATRT at SJCRH during the 19-year study interval. Six patients were excluded from this clinical review based on pathologic or clinical criteria. Of the remaining 31 patients, 22 were younger than 3 years. Posterior fossa primary lesions and metastatic disease at diagnosis were more common in younger patients with ATRT. All patients underwent surgical resection; 30 received subsequent chemotherapy. The majority of patients aged 3 years or older received postoperative craniospinal radiation. Two-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of children aged 3 years or older (EFS, 78% + 14%; OS, 89% +/- 11%) were significantly better than those for younger patients (EFS, 11% +/- 6%; OS, 17% +/- 8%); EFS, P = .009 and OS, P = .0001. No other clinical characteristics were predictive of survival. Three of four patients 3 years or older with progressive disease were successfully rescued with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide therapy.

Loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 1p and 16q is an adverse prognostic factor in favorable-histology Wilms tumor: a report from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-08-29,"To determine if tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosomes 1p or 16q is associated with a poorer prognosis for children with favorable-histology (FH) Wilms tumor entered on the fifth National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS-5). Between August 1995 and June 2002, 2,021 previously untreated children with FH or anaplastic Wilms tumor, clear-cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) or malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK), were treated with stage- and histology-specific therapy. Their tumors were assayed for LOH for polymorphic DNA markers on chromosomes 1p and 16q. ResultsLOH for 1p or 16q was rarely observed in CCSK (n = 90) or RTK (n = 22). The relative risk (RR) of relapse for patients with FH stage I to IV tumors with LOH, stratified by stage, was 1.56 for LOH 1p (P = .01) and 1.49 for LOH 16q (P = .01), whereas the RR of death was 1.84 (P = .03) and 1.44 (P = .15), respectively. When the effects of LOH for both regions were considered jointly among patients with stage I to II FH disease, the risks of relapse and death were increased for LOH 1p only (RR = 2.2, P = .02 for relapse; RR = 4.0, P = .02 for death), for LOH 16q only (RR = 1.9, P = .01 and RR = 1.4, P = .60) and for LOH for both regions (RR = 2.9, P = .001 and RR = 4.3, P = .01) in comparison with patients with LOH at neither locus.

Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney in the National Wilms' Tumor Study: age at diagnosis as a prognostic factor.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-10-01,"The objective of this study is to determine prognostic factors in rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK), including both demographic and treatment variables. A total of 142 patients studied on National Wilms' Tumor Studies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were analyzed. Patients were enrolled between the years 1969 and 2002. Variables examined included sex, age of diagnosis, tumor stage, presence of CNS lesions, as well as treatment variables, including the use of doxorubicin and/or radiotherapy (RT). No survival differences were observed between males and females, between those treated with or without doxorubicin, or with or without RT. Patients with tumors of lower stage had an overall survival rate of 41.8%, whereas, tumors of higher stage were associated with a 15.9% survival (P < .001). A highly significant difference in survival was noted when patients were stratified according to age of diagnosis. Survival at 4 years in infants under 6 months of age at diagnosis was 8.8%, whereas, survival in patients 2 years of age or older was 41.1% (P < .0001). Stratification into intermediate age brackets demonstrated a strong correlation of increasing survival with increasing age at diagnosis. All patients with a CNS lesion, except one, died. Age at diagnosis is a highly significant prognostic factor for survival of children with RTK. Infants have a dismal prognosis, whereas, older children have a more favorable outcome.

Inactivation of the Snf5 tumor suppressor stimulates cell cycle progression and cooperates with p53 loss in oncogenic transformation.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2005-11-21,"Snf5 (Ini1/Baf47/Smarcb1), a core member of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex, is a potent tumor suppressor whose mechanism of action is largely unknown. Biallelic loss of Snf5 leads to the onset of aggressive cancers in both humans and mice. We have developed an innovative and widely applicable analytical technique for cross-species validation of cancer models and show that the gene expression profiles of our Snf5 murine models closely resemble those of human Snf5-deficient rhabdoid tumors. We exploit this system to produce what we believe to be the first report documenting the effects on gene expression of inactivating a Swi/Snf subunit in normal mammalian cells and to identify the transcriptional pathways regulated by Snf5. We demonstrate that the tumor suppressor activity of Snf5 depends on its regulation of cell cycle progression; Snf5 inactivation leads to aberrant up-regulation of E2F targets and increased levels of p53 that are accompanied by apoptosis, polyploidy, and growth arrest. Further, conditional mouse models demonstrate that inactivation of p16Ink4a or Rb (retinoblastoma) does not accelerate tumor formation in Snf5 conditional mice, whereas mutation of p53 leads to a dramatic acceleration of tumor formation.",Journal Article,5174.0,145.0,Snf5 Ini1/Baf47/Smarcb1 core member Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex potent suppressor mechanism action largely unknown Biallelic loss Snf5 leads onset aggressive humans mice developed innovative widely applicable analytical technique cross-species validation models expression profiles Snf5 murine models closely resemble human Snf5-deficient rhabdoid exploit produce believe report documenting effects expression inactivating Swi/Snf subunit normal mammalian identify transcriptional pathways regulated Snf5 demonstrate suppressor activity Snf5 depends regulation cycle progression Snf5 inactivation leads aberrant up-regulation E2F targets increased levels p53 accompanied apoptosis polyploidy growth arrest conditional mouse models demonstrate inactivation p16Ink4a Rb retinoblastoma accelerate formation Snf5 conditional mice p53 leads dramatic acceleration formation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6976, 11933, 17693, 5952, 8, 1793, 2693, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 2287, 4429, 840, 16, 8, 1157, 30, 1245, 1310, 670, 1, 1578, 16, 1733, 860, 6435, 407, 1, 6976, 1940, 6, 3, 1707, 1, 571, 163, 4, 110, 3218, 2, 399, 21, 47, 276, 35, 4019, 2, 1792, 3801, 5625, 1312, 9, 1383, 2915, 929, 1, 12, 274, 2, 514, 17, 3, 145, 55, 1241, 1, 114, 6976, 1471, 274, 3210, 8247, 135, 1, 171, 6976, 1971, 57, 21, 6109, 26, 398, 6, 2410, 2067, 21, 4629, 6, 40, 3, 157, 414, 9255, 3, 176, 23, 145, 55, 1, 6096, 8, 4983, 5071, 3350, 4, 295, 2359, 37, 2, 6, 255, 3, 1431, 460, 1065, 20, 6976, 21, 608, 17, 3, 30, 1245, 128, 1, 6976, 3828, 23, 211, 863, 1, 31, 417, 91, 6976, 2297, 1940, 6, 1898, 126, 863, 1, 5391, 637, 2, 101, 148, 1, 624, 17, 32, 2756, 20, 351, 24874, 2, 129, 1854, 195, 3212, 830, 274, 608, 17, 2297, 1, 13747, 15, 2955, 1097, 44, 5792, 30, 1264, 4, 6976, 3212, 399, 547, 258, 1, 624, 1940, 6, 8, 3079, 11951, 1, 30, 1264]",1210.0,16301525,Inactivation Snf5 suppressor stimulates cycle progression cooperates p53 loss oncogenic transformation,2,0.03125
Association of low-grade endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus and ovary with undifferentiated carcinoma: a new type of dedifferentiated carcinoma?,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2006-01-01,"Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, either of the endometrium or the ovaries, usually have an excellent prognosis. The association of this type of tumor with undifferentiated carcinoma is rare. In this study, we present the clinicopathologic features of 25 such cases. The age of the patients ranged from 30 to 82 years (median, 51 years). At presentation, the patients had either vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain. The endometrioid carcinoma involved the endometrium in 14 cases, the endometrium and 1 or both ovaries in 9 cases, and the ovaries in 2 cases. Undifferentiated carcinoma associated with low-grade endometrioid carcinoma was found at presentation in 19 grade 1 or 2 endometrioid carcinomas: 15 in the endometrium and 5 in the ovary. In one of these cases, undifferentiated carcinoma was found in the endometrium and the ovary. Undifferentiated carcinoma was found after resection of low-grade endometrioid carcinoma in six cases, involving the retroperitoneum, pelvis, vagina, or liver. The undifferentiated carcinoma was composed exclusively of diffuse sheets and solid nests of epithelial cells in l0 cases. Epithelial cells with isolated foci of keratinization were seen in nine cases and rhabdoid cells in a myxoid background in six cases. Twenty-four patients were treated with total abdominal hysterectomy and with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Twenty-two patients received additional therapy as follows: chemotherapy (), radiotherapy (), and tamoxifen (). Follow-up showed that 15 patients died of disease in 1 to 60 months (median, 6 months), and 5 patients are alive with progressive disease with a follow-up between 6 and 8 months; 1 patient is alive with no evidence of disease at 104 months. In four cases, the diagnosis was made recently, with short follow-ups of 3 and 4 months. Foci of undifferentiated carcinoma may be confused with solid endometrioid adenocarcinoma erroneously leading to the diagnosis of a grade 3 or a significantly less aggressive grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma. The recognition of undifferentiated carcinoma in an otherwise low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma is extremely important because it indicates aggressive behavior. In asynchronous cases, being aware of this association can explain the absence of a second primary.",Journal Article,5133.0,134.0,Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas endometrium ovaries usually excellent prognosis association type undifferentiated carcinoma rare present clinicopathologic features 25 cases age patients ranged 30 82 years median 51 years presentation patients vaginal bleeding pelvic pain endometrioid carcinoma involved endometrium 14 cases endometrium 1 ovaries 9 cases ovaries 2 cases Undifferentiated carcinoma associated low-grade endometrioid carcinoma presentation 19 grade 1 2 endometrioid carcinomas 15 endometrium 5 ovary cases undifferentiated carcinoma endometrium ovary Undifferentiated carcinoma resection low-grade endometrioid carcinoma cases involving retroperitoneum pelvis vagina liver undifferentiated carcinoma composed exclusively diffuse sheets solid nests epithelial l0 cases Epithelial isolated foci keratinization seen cases rhabdoid myxoid background cases Twenty-four patients treated total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Twenty-two patients received additional therapy follows chemotherapy radiotherapy tamoxifen Follow-up showed 15 patients died disease 1 60 months median 6 months 5 patients alive progressive disease follow-up 6 8 months 1 patient alive evidence disease 104 months cases diagnosis recently short follow-ups 3 4 months Foci undifferentiated carcinoma confused solid endometrioid adenocarcinoma erroneously leading diagnosis grade 3 significantly aggressive grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma recognition undifferentiated carcinoma low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma extremely important indicates aggressive behavior asynchronous cases aware association explain absence second primary,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[154, 88, 3151, 826, 361, 1, 3, 15, 3, 7262, 2082, 47, 35, 1503, 356, 3, 248, 1, 26, 267, 1, 30, 5, 4480, 134, 16, 622, 4, 26, 45, 21, 364, 3, 1399, 404, 1, 243, 225, 140, 3, 89, 1, 3, 7, 1869, 29, 201, 6, 878, 60, 52, 725, 60, 28, 1031, 3, 7, 42, 361, 2294, 15, 1110, 559, 3, 3151, 134, 646, 3, 4, 213, 140, 3, 2, 14, 15, 110, 7262, 4, 83, 140, 2, 3, 7262, 4, 18, 140, 4480, 134, 41, 5, 154, 88, 3151, 134, 10, 204, 28, 1031, 4, 326, 88, 14, 15, 18, 3151, 826, 167, 4, 3, 2, 33, 4, 3, 3631, 4, 104, 1, 46, 140, 4480, 134, 10, 204, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3631, 4480, 134, 10, 204, 50, 170, 1, 154, 88, 3151, 134, 4, 437, 140, 1267, 3, 7765, 3270, 7553, 15, 3, 4480, 134, 10, 3317, 4437, 1, 1388, 13568, 2, 537, 14121, 1, 701, 37, 4, 55177, 140, 701, 37, 5, 1355, 3340, 1, 30879, 11, 527, 4, 762, 140, 2, 37, 4, 8, 5707, 2426, 4, 437, 140, 737, 294, 7, 11, 73, 5, 181, 1467, 2622, 2, 5, 1607, 5690, 3470, 737, 100, 7, 103, 402, 36, 22, 2962, 56, 310, 2, 1105, 166, 126, 224, 17, 167, 7, 1016, 1, 34, 4, 14, 6, 335, 53, 52, 49, 53, 2, 33, 7, 32, 1701, 5, 1014, 34, 5, 8, 166, 126, 59, 49, 2, 66, 53, 14, 69, 16, 1701, 5, 77, 241, 1, 34, 28, 3407, 53, 4, 294, 140, 3, 147, 10, 1229, 761, 5, 978, 166, 6106, 1, 27, 2, 39, 53, 3340, 1, 4480, 134, 68, 40, 21075, 5, 537, 3151, 449, 27829, 1049, 6, 3, 147, 1, 8, 88, 27, 15, 8, 97, 299, 571, 88, 18, 3151, 134, 3, 2335, 1, 4480, 134, 4, 35, 2632, 154, 88, 3151, 449, 16, 2938, 305, 408, 192, 2640, 571, 1710, 4, 18272, 140, 486, 4749, 1, 26, 248, 122, 2943, 3, 1127, 1, 8, 419, 86]",2142.0,16306785,Association low-grade endometrioid carcinoma uterus ovary undifferentiated carcinoma new type dedifferentiated carcinoma,0,0.0

Cancer Res.,2006-01-01,"Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC) control the acetylation state of histones and other proteins regulating transcription and protein function. Several structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors have been developed as cancer therapeutic agents and in vitro have been shown to cause differentiation, cell cycle arrest, or apoptosis. Here, we have evaluated depsipeptide, a natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor, against a panel of pediatric solid tumor models in vivo and evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables with tumor sensitivity. Depsipeptide was administered at the maximum tolerated dose (4.4 mg/kg administered every 7 days x 3 i.v. repeated q21d for a total of two cycles) to scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood tumors (9 brain tumors, 11 kidney cancers, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 3 neuroblastomas, and 7 osteosarcomas). Pharmacokinetic variables were determined, as were changes in histone and p53 acetylation, induction of p53 and p53 genotype, and alterations in Akt phosphorylation. Of 39 tumors evaluated, three showed objective tumor regressions [two brain tumors (primitive neuroectodermal tumor and atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid tumor) and one Wilms' tumor]. Depsipeptide inhibited growth of many tumor lines but achieved stable disease (<25% increase in volume during treatment cycle 1) in only two tumor models (anaplastic astrocytoma, two rhabdomyosarcomas, and a Wilms' tumor). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the population estimated AUC(0-24) was 1,123 ng h/mL, similar to the exposure following 13 mg/m2 in ongoing phase I trials. Pharmacodynamic changes in histone acetylation (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) in three depsipeptide-sensitive and three intrinsically resistant tumors followed a similar pattern; maximal increases in histone acetylation occurred at 8 hours and were elevated for up to 96 hours. In two sensitive tumor lines, IRS56 and BT27 (both wild-type p53) p53 increased in treated tumors being maximal at 8 hours and associated with induction of p21(cip1), whereas p53 was stable in tumors with mutant p53. Sensitivity to depsipeptide did not correlate with p53 genotype, p53 acetylation, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473). Our results show that depsipeptide inhibits its target in vivo causing increased histone acetylation; however, this does not correlate with drug sensitivity. The relatively low objective response rate [3 of 39 (8%) tumor lines showing greater than or equal to partial response and 4 (10%) stable disease] administered at dose levels that give clinically relevant drug exposures suggests that as a single agent depsipeptide may have limited clinical utility against pediatric solid tumors in a first-line setting.",Journal Article,5133.0,75.0,"Histone acetyltransferases histone deacetylases HDAC control acetylation state histones regulating transcription function structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors developed therapeutic agents vitro shown cause differentiation cycle arrest apoptosis evaluated depsipeptide natural tetrapeptide HDAC inhibitor panel pediatric solid models vivo evaluated pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic variables sensitivity Depsipeptide administered maximum tolerated dose 4.4 mg/kg administered 7 days x 3 i.v repeated q21d total cycles scid mice bearing 39 independently derived childhood 9 brain 11 kidney 9 rhabdomyosarcomas 3 neuroblastomas 7 osteosarcomas Pharmacokinetic variables determined changes histone p53 acetylation induction p53 p53 genotype alterations Akt phosphorylation 39 evaluated showed objective regressions brain primitive neuroectodermal atypical teratoid malignant rhabdoid Wilms Depsipeptide inhibited growth lines achieved stable disease 25 increase volume treatment cycle 1 models anaplastic astrocytoma rhabdomyosarcomas Wilms Pharmacokinetic showed population estimated AUC 0-24 1,123 ng h/mL similar exposure following 13 mg/m2 ongoing phase trials Pharmacodynamic changes histone acetylation H2A H2B H3 H4 depsipeptide-sensitive intrinsically resistant followed similar pattern maximal increases histone acetylation occurred 8 hours elevated 96 hours sensitive lines IRS56 BT27 wild-type p53 p53 increased treated maximal 8 hours associated induction p21 cip1 p53 stable p53 Sensitivity depsipeptide correlate p53 genotype p53 acetylation cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase phosphorylation Akt Ser473 depsipeptide inhibits target vivo causing increased histone acetylation correlate drug sensitivity relatively low objective response rate 3 39 8 lines showing greater equal partial response 4 10 stable disease administered dose levels clinically relevant drug exposures suggests single agent depsipeptide limited clinical utility pediatric solid first-line setting",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1508, 18849, 2, 1508, 9758, 2654, 182, 3, 4145, 1309, 1, 8457, 2, 127, 652, 2681, 866, 2, 178, 343, 392, 8533, 1867, 2654, 222, 47, 85, 276, 22, 12, 189, 183, 2, 4, 439, 47, 85, 443, 6, 708, 910, 31, 417, 1854, 15, 351, 467, 21, 47, 194, 10072, 8, 1504, 38094, 2654, 230, 480, 8, 993, 1, 815, 537, 30, 274, 4, 386, 2, 194, 1456, 2, 2424, 682, 5, 30, 485, 10072, 10, 468, 28, 3, 689, 421, 61, 39, 39, 81, 503, 468, 454, 67, 162, 1006, 27, 70, 603, 2113, 22333, 9, 8, 181, 1, 100, 410, 6, 4129, 399, 1894, 587, 1042, 526, 864, 57, 83, 342, 57, 175, 163, 83, 15480, 27, 8915, 2, 67, 11089, 1456, 682, 11, 509, 22, 11, 400, 4, 1508, 2, 624, 4145, 504, 1, 624, 2, 624, 1183, 2, 593, 4, 649, 982, 1, 587, 57, 194, 169, 224, 461, 30, 5142, 100, 342, 57, 5594, 7160, 30, 2, 1973, 12478, 393, 30, 2, 104, 30, 10072, 879, 129, 1, 445, 30, 285, 84, 513, 585, 34, 243, 344, 4, 433, 190, 24, 417, 14, 4, 158, 100, 30, 274, 1841, 3822, 100, 15480, 2, 8, 30, 1456, 65, 224, 17, 3, 266, 661, 1376, 13, 259, 10, 14, 2698, 997, 555, 542, 288, 6, 3, 645, 366, 233, 81, 821, 4, 942, 124, 70, 143, 2424, 400, 4, 1508, 4145, 19741, 26465, 3739, 2, 7812, 4, 169, 10072, 745, 2, 169, 9759, 436, 57, 370, 8, 288, 1177, 2725, 1106, 4, 1508, 4145, 489, 28, 66, 1459, 2, 11, 804, 9, 126, 6, 921, 1459, 4, 100, 745, 30, 285, 55233, 2, 55234, 110, 955, 267, 624, 624, 101, 4, 73, 57, 486, 2725, 28, 66, 1459, 2, 41, 5, 504, 1, 2657, 6927, 547, 624, 10, 585, 4, 57, 5, 620, 624, 485, 6, 10072, 205, 44, 1513, 5, 624, 1183, 624, 4145, 5885, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 15, 982, 1, 649, 11842, 114, 99, 514, 17, 10072, 1576, 211, 283, 4, 386, 3440, 101, 1508, 4145, 137, 26, 1097, 44, 1513, 5, 234, 485, 3, 1352, 154, 461, 51, 116, 27, 1, 587, 66, 30, 285, 2069, 378, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 450, 51, 2, 39, 79, 585, 34, 468, 28, 61, 148, 17, 4978, 505, 867, 234, 3401, 844, 17, 22, 8, 226, 420, 10072, 68, 47, 383, 38, 1207, 480, 815, 537, 57, 4, 8, 157, 328, 546]",2660.0,16397046,Evaluation antitumor efficacy pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide childhood models vivo,0,0.0

Comparative analysis of germ cell transcription factors in CNS germinoma reveals diagnostic utility of NANOG.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2006-12-01,"The homeodomain transcription factor, NANOG, along with OCT3/4 (POU5F1) and SOX2, is part of the core set of transcription factors that maintain embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. Expression of NANOG has been detected in fetal germ cells and in gonadal germ cell tumors. To assess the diagnostic utility of NANOG in central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors, we analyzed its expression by immunohistochemistry in a series of 12 CNS germinomas and compared its expression with other stem cell markers. Strong nuclear expression of NANOG was demonstrated in >90% of the tumor cells in all cases. In contrast, expression of OCT3/4 and placental alkaline phosphatase was inconsistent and SOX2 was expressed in only rare cells. NANOG was not detected in tumor types frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of CNS germinoma: pineoblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, medulloblastoma, lymphoma, pituitary adenoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and gliomas. These findings demonstrate that NANOG is a sensitive and specific marker of CNS germinoma. Compared with other currently used markers, NANOG may have superior diagnostic characteristics and can facilitate identification of germinomas in minute surgical biopsies commonly obtained from these tumors. These findings also suggest a potential biologic role for NANOG in maintenance of CNS germinoma.",Comparative Study,4799.0,35.0,homeodomain transcription factor NANOG OCT3/4 POU5F1 SOX2 core set transcription factors maintain embryonic stem self-renewal pluripotency Expression NANOG detected fetal germ gonadal germ assess diagnostic utility NANOG central nervous CNS germ expression immunohistochemistry series 12 CNS germinomas compared expression stem markers Strong nuclear expression NANOG demonstrated 90 cases contrast expression OCT3/4 placental alkaline phosphatase inconsistent SOX2 expressed rare NANOG detected types frequently considered differential diagnosis CNS germinoma pineoblastoma primitive neuroectodermal medulloblastoma lymphoma pituitary adenoma atypical teratoid/rhabdoid Langerhans histiocytosis gliomas findings demonstrate NANOG sensitive specific marker CNS germinoma Compared currently markers NANOG superior diagnostic characteristics facilitate identification germinomas minute surgical biopsies commonly obtained findings suggest potential biologic role NANOG maintenance CNS germinoma,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 18140, 866, 161, 11851, 1510, 5, 14184, 39, 34181, 2, 4664, 16, 760, 1, 3, 1793, 916, 1, 866, 130, 17, 3040, 5390, 452, 31, 1074, 4495, 2, 13153, 55, 1, 11851, 71, 85, 530, 4, 6698, 2280, 37, 2, 4, 7999, 2280, 31, 57, 6, 423, 3, 752, 1207, 1, 11851, 4, 854, 1880, 398, 1025, 2280, 31, 57, 21, 311, 211, 55, 20, 888, 4, 8, 988, 1, 133, 1025, 14493, 2, 72, 211, 55, 5, 127, 452, 31, 525, 1082, 928, 55, 1, 11851, 10, 264, 4, 424, 1, 3, 30, 37, 4, 62, 140, 4, 748, 55, 1, 14184, 39, 2, 9690, 5355, 2577, 10, 4923, 2, 4664, 10, 570, 4, 158, 622, 37, 11851, 10, 44, 530, 4, 30, 630, 746, 515, 4, 3, 1777, 147, 1, 1025, 12292, 14221, 5594, 7160, 57, 2714, 2434, 1973, 12478, 15458, 30, 15702, 31, 13976, 2, 1287, 46, 272, 608, 17, 11851, 16, 8, 745, 2, 112, 952, 1, 1025, 12292, 72, 5, 127, 694, 95, 525, 11851, 68, 47, 1123, 752, 374, 2, 122, 1876, 911, 1, 14493, 4, 3949, 221, 1154, 841, 683, 29, 46, 57, 46, 272, 120, 309, 8, 174, 1283, 200, 9, 11851, 4, 1146, 1, 1025, 12292]",1371.0,17122519,Comparative germ transcription factors CNS germinoma reveals diagnostic utility NANOG,1,0.015625

We describe a case of an AT/RT of the spinal cord in an adult. A 43-year old woman presented with neck and left upper extremity pain. An MRI demonstrated a mass lesion in the dorsal spinal cord extending from C4 to C6. The patient underwent a C3 through C7 laminectomy. In consultation with senior pathologists at other institutions, the lesion was initially diagnosed as a rhabdoid meningioma. Molecular genetic studies revealed monosomy 22 and loss of expression of the INI1 gene in 22q11.2. Subsequently, immunohistochemical studies revealed the absence of INI1 gene expression in the malignant cells, supporting the diagnosis of AT/RT. The patient underwent three additional surgical procedures for recurrent disease throughout the neuraxis secondary to leptomeningeal spread of the tumor. Despite aggressive surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the patient succumbed to the disease two and a half years after her initial presentation.

Tumor-specific cooperation of retinoblastoma protein family and Snf5 inactivation.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-04-01,"Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are rare aggressive cancers that occur in young children. Seventy-five percent of sporadic MRTs harbor inactivating SNF5 mutations, and mice heterozygous for an Snf5-null allele develop MRTs with partial penetrance. The diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinomas (CPC) in addition to MRTs in families with a single mutant SNF5 allele prompted us to assess the role of SNF5 loss in CPC in genetically engineered mice. With high frequency, TgT(121) mice develop CPCs that are initiated by inactivation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and related proteins p107 and p130. However, CPC penetrance and latency were not significantly affected by Snf5 heterozygosity, consistent with recent evidence that CPCs in SNF5 families were, in many cases, misdiagnosed MRTs. Surprisingly, although the CPC phenotype was unaffected, TgT(121);Snf5(+/-) mice developed MRTs with increased penetrance and decreased latency compared with TgT(121);Snf5(+/+) littermates. MRTs expressed the T(121) protein with a concomitant increase in mitotic activity.

We sought to determine the significance of SCU histology in patients with unresectable HB. Patients enrolled on the pediatric Intergroup (INT0098) trial for HB and patients from the personal consultation files of two of the authors (MF, LG) were reviewed for cases with SCU histology. These patients were compared with SCU HB patients identified by literature review. Eleven patients were studied. All patients with reported AFP results exhibited normal or minimally increased serum AFP levels. None of the patients survived: 10 died of disease progression, and 1 died from treatment complications. Immunostaining revealed that tumors from six of six patients tested were INI1 negative. Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities in one patient (and two patients from the literature review) were similar to those described in rhabdoid tumors. Comparison with patients from the literature review revealed similar results except that 4 of 29 patients survived without evidence of disease. SCU histology in HB patients is associated with an adverse outcome. These tumors appear to be biologically different from non-SCU HB. Evaluation of patient characteristics and outcomes for children with SCU HB and/or those with low AFP levels should be determined from large cooperative group studies.

Clin. Oncol.,2008-12-08,"Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) of the CNS is a highly malignant neoplasm primarily affecting young children, with a historic median survival ranging from 6 to 11 months. Based on a previous pilot series, a prospective multi-institutional trial was conducted for patients with newly diagnosed CNS ATRT. Treatment was divided into five phases: preirradiation, chemoradiation, consolidation, maintenance, and continuation therapy. Intrathecal chemotherapy was administered, alternating intralumbar and intraventricular routes. Radiation therapy (RT) was prescribed, either focal (54 Gy) or craniospinal (36 Gy, plus primary boost), depending on age and extent of disease at diagnosis. Between 2004 and 2006, 25 patients were enrolled; 20 were eligible for evaluation. Median age at diagnosis was 26 months (range, 2.4 months to 19.5 years). Gross total resection of the primary tumor was achieved in 11 patients. Fourteen patients had M0 disease at diagnosis, one patient had M2 disease, and five patients had M3 disease. Fifteen patients received radiation therapy: 11 focal and four craniospinal. Significant toxicities, in addition to the expected, included radiation recall (n = 2) and transverse myelitis (n = 1). There was one toxic death. Of the 12 patients who were assessable for chemotherapeutic response (pre-RT), the objective response rate was 58%. The objective response rate observed after RT was 38%.

The study estimated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of an oxaliplatin and etoposide regimen in children with recurrent solid tumors. Oxaliplatin was administered on Day 1 and etoposide on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day course. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels: 1) oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m(2) and etoposide at a dose of 75 mg/m(2), 2) oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m(2) and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m(2), and 3) oxaliplatin at a dose of 145 mg/m(2) and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m(2). Calcium and magnesium infusions were used at dose level 3 in an attempt to escalate the oxaliplatin dose past the single-agent MTD. The 16 patients received a total of 63 courses. At dose level 1, dose-limiting epistaxis, neuropathy, and neutropenia occurred in 1 of 6 patients. No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred at dose level 2 (n = 6). At dose level 3, 2 of 4 patients experienced dose-limiting neutropenia; none experienced grade 3 or 4 acute neuropathy. Six patients required prolongation of the oxaliplatin infusion because of acute sensory neuropathy. Responses were observed in patients with medulloblastoma (1 complete response) and pineoblastoma (1 partial response); 3 others with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor, ependymoma, and soft tissue sarcoma had prolonged disease stabilization. The MTD of this regimen was found to be oxaliplatin at a dose of 130 mg/m(2) given on Day 1 and etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m(2)/d given on Days 1 to 3. Neutropenia was found to be the DLT.

Inactivation of SNF5 cooperates with p53 loss to accelerate tumor formation in Snf5(+/-);p53(+/-) mice.,Molecular carcinogenesis,Mol. Carcinog.,2009-12-01,"Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are poorly differentiated pediatric cancers that arise in various anatomical locations and have a very poor outcome. The large majority of these malignancies are caused by loss of function of the SNF5/INI1 component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. However, the mechanism of tumor development associated with SNF5 loss remains unclear. Multiple studies have demonstrated a role for SNF5 in the regulation of cyclin D1, p16(INK4A), and pRb(f) activities suggesting it functions through the SWI/SNF complex to affect transcription of genes involved in cell cycle control. Previous studies in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) have shown that loss of SNF5 on a p53-null background significantly accelerates tumor development. Here, we use established GEMM to further define the relationship between the SNF5 and p53 tumor suppressor pathways. Combined haploinsufficiency of p53 and Snf5 leads to decreased latency for MRTs arising in alternate anatomical locations but not for the standard facial MRTs.

Loss of the tumor suppressor Snf5 leads to aberrant activation of the Hedgehog-Gli pathway.,Nature medicine,Nat. Med.,2010-11-14,"Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway can drive tumorigenesis. To investigate the mechanism by which glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 (GLI1), a crucial effector of Hh signaling, regulates Hh pathway activation, we searched for GLI1-interacting proteins. We report that the chromatin remodeling protein SNF5 (encoded by SMARCB1, hereafter called SNF5), which is inactivated in human malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), interacts with GLI1. We show that Snf5 localizes to Gli1-regulated promoters and that loss of Snf5 leads to activation of the Hh-Gli pathway. Conversely, re-expression of SNF5 in MRT cells represses GLI1. Consistent with this, we show the presence of a Hh-Gli-activated gene expression profile in primary MRTs and show that GLI1 drives the growth of SNF5-deficient MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our studies reveal that SNF5 is a key mediator of Hh signaling and that aberrant activation of GLI1 is a previously undescribed targetable mechanism contributing to the growth of MRT cells.",Journal Article,3355.0,134.0,Aberrant activation Hedgehog Hh pathway drive tumorigenesis investigate mechanism glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 GLI1 crucial effector Hh signaling regulates Hh pathway activation searched GLI1-interacting report chromatin remodeling SNF5 encoded SMARCB1 called SNF5 inactivated human malignant rhabdoid MRTs interacts GLI1 Snf5 localizes Gli1-regulated promoters loss Snf5 leads activation Hh-Gli pathway Conversely re-expression SNF5 MRT represses GLI1 Consistent presence Hh-Gli-activated expression profile primary MRTs GLI1 drives growth SNF5-deficient MRT vitro vivo studies reveal SNF5 key mediator Hh signaling aberrant activation GLI1 previously undescribed targetable mechanism contributing growth MRT,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1898, 363, 1, 3, 4097, 4474, 308, 122, 3279, 1565, 6, 963, 3, 670, 20, 92, 945, 41, 1836, 607, 5988, 8079, 14, 5124, 8, 2653, 2070, 1, 4474, 314, 2468, 4474, 308, 363, 21, 3080, 9, 5124, 5505, 652, 21, 414, 17, 3, 2287, 4429, 178, 6976, 4587, 20, 5952, 12394, 3472, 6976, 92, 16, 5458, 4, 171, 393, 57, 12654, 5528, 5, 5124, 21, 514, 17, 6976, 13495, 6, 5124, 1065, 4347, 2, 17, 407, 1, 6976, 1940, 6, 363, 1, 3, 4474, 10754, 308, 3154, 1491, 55, 1, 6976, 4, 11848, 37, 10946, 5124, 925, 5, 26, 21, 514, 3, 463, 1, 8, 4474, 10754, 735, 145, 55, 800, 4, 86, 12654, 2, 514, 17, 5124, 5267, 3, 129, 1, 6976, 1971, 11848, 37, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 673, 114, 94, 2396, 17, 6976, 16, 8, 825, 3810, 1, 4474, 314, 2, 17, 1898, 363, 1, 5124, 16, 8, 373, 13317, 3985, 670, 3156, 6, 3, 129, 1, 11848, 37]",1006.0,21076395,Loss suppressor Snf5 leads aberrant activation Hedgehog-Gli pathway,0,0.0

Sequencing of local therapy affects the pattern of treatment failure and survival in children with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors of the central nervous system.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-05-19,"To assess the pattern of treatment failure associated with current therapeutic paradigms for childhood atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). Pediatric patients with AT/RT of the central nervous system treated at our institution between 1987 and 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and cumulative incidence of local failure were correlated with age, sex, tumor location, extent of disease, and extent of surgical resection. Radiotherapy (RT) sequencing, chemotherapy, dose, timing, and volume administered after resection were also evaluated. Thirty-one patients at a median age of 2.3 years at diagnosis (range, 0.45-16.87 years) were enrolled into protocols that included risk- and age-stratified RT. Craniospinal irradiation with focal tumor bed boost (median dose, 54 Gy) was administered to 18 patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 16. Ten patients presented with metastases at diagnosis. RT was delayed more than 3 months in 20 patients and between 1 and 3 months in 4; 7 patients received immediate postoperative irradiation preceding high-dose alkylator-based chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 48 months, the cumulative incidence of local treatment failure was 37.5% ± 9%; progression-free survival was 33.2% ± 10%; and OS was 53.5% ± 10%. Children receiving delayed RT (≥1 month postoperatively) were more likely to experience local failure (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, p = 0.007); the development of distant metastases before RT increased the risk of progression (HR 3.49, p = 0.006); and any evidence of disease progressionbefore RT decreased OS (HR 20.78, p = 0.004). Disease progression occurred in 52% (11/21) of children with initially localized tumors who underwent gross total resection, and the progression rate increased proportionally with increasing delay from surgery to RT. Delayed RT is associated with a higher rate of local and metastatic disease progression in children with AT/RT.

Brain tumor therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstem measured with longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-06-12,"To characterize therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstems of childhood brain tumor patients by serial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We analyzed 109 DTI studies from 20 brain tumor patients, aged 4 to 23 years, with normal-appearing brainstems included in the treatment fields. Those with medulloblastomas, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n = 10) received postoperative craniospinal irradiation (23.4-39.6 Gy) and a cumulative dose of 55.8 Gy to the primary site, followed by four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade gliomas (n = 10) received erlotinib during and after irradiation (54-59.4 Gy). Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were computed and spatially registered to three-dimensional radiation dose data. Volumes of interest included corticospinal tracts, medial lemnisci, and the pons. Serving as an age-related benchmark for comparison, 37 DTI studies from 20 healthy volunteers, aged 6 to 25 years, were included in the analysis. The median DTI follow-up time was 3.5 years (range, 1.6-5.0 years). The median mean dose to the pons was 56 Gy (range, 7-59 Gy). Three patterns were seen in longitudinal FA and apparent diffusion coefficient changes: (1) a stable or normal developing time trend, (2) initial deviation from normal with subsequent recovery, and (3) progressive deviation without evidence of complete recovery. The maximal decline in FA often occurred 1.5 to 3.5 years after the start of radiation therapy. A full recovery time trend could be observed within 4 years.

Phase I trial of MK-0752 in children with refractory CNS malignancies: a pediatric brain tumor consortium study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-08-08,"To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), describe dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and characterize pharmacokinetic properties of MK-0752, a gamma secretase inhibitor, in children with refractory or recurrent CNS malignancies. MK-0752 was administered once daily for 3 consecutive days of every 7 days at escalating dosages starting at 200 mg/m(2). The modified continual reassessment method was used to estimate the MTD. A course was 28 days in duration. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed during the first course. Expression of NOTCH and hairy enhancer of split (HES) proteins was assessed in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and following treatment with MK-0752. Twenty-three eligible patients were enrolled: 10 males (median age, 8.1 years; range, 2.6 to 17.7 years) with diagnoses of brainstem glioma (n = 6), ependymoma (n = 8), medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 4), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 2), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (n = 1), malignant glioma (n = 1), and choroid plexus carcinoma, (n = 1). Seventeen patients were fully evaluable for toxicity. No DLTs occurred in the three patients enrolled at 200 mg/m(2)/dose. At 260 mg/m(2)/dose, DLTs occurred in two of six patients, both of whom experienced grade 3 ALT and AST. There were no grade 4 toxicities; non-dose-limiting grade 3 toxicities included hypokalemia and lymphopenia. Population pharmacokinetic values (% coefficient of variation) for MK-0752 were apparent oral clearance, 0.444 (38%) L/h/m(2); apparent volume of distribution, 7.36 (24%) L/m(2); and k(a), 0.358 (99%) hr(-1). MK-0752 is well-tolerated in children with recurrent CNS malignancies. The recommended phase II dose using the 3 days on followed by 4 days off schedule is 260 mg/m(2)/dose once daily.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3088.0,112.0,estimate maximum-tolerated dose MTD dose-limiting toxicities DLTs characterize pharmacokinetic properties MK-0752 gamma secretase inhibitor children refractory recurrent CNS malignancies MK-0752 administered daily 3 consecutive days 7 days escalating dosages starting 200 mg/m 2 modified continual reassessment estimate MTD course 28 days duration Pharmacokinetic performed course Expression NOTCH hairy enhancer split HES assessed peripheral-blood mononuclear PBMCs following treatment MK-0752 Twenty-three eligible patients enrolled 10 males median age 8.1 years range 2.6 17.7 years diagnoses brainstem glioma n 6 ependymoma n 8 medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal n 4 glioblastoma multiforme n 2 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid n 1 malignant glioma n 1 choroid plexus carcinoma n 1 Seventeen patients fully evaluable toxicity DLTs occurred patients enrolled 200 mg/m 2 /dose 260 mg/m 2 /dose DLTs occurred patients experienced grade 3 ALT AST grade 4 toxicities non-dose-limiting grade 3 toxicities included hypokalemia lymphopenia Population pharmacokinetic values coefficient variation MK-0752 apparent oral clearance 0.444 38 L/h/m 2 apparent volume distribution 7.36 24 L/m 2 k 0.358 99 hr -1 MK-0752 well-tolerated children recurrent CNS malignancies recommended phase II dose 3 days followed 4 days schedule 260 mg/m 2 /dose daily,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 1191, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 897, 61, 817, 385, 2506, 2, 1507, 1456, 1571, 1, 3558, 15399, 8, 1705, 10014, 230, 4, 541, 5, 430, 15, 387, 1025, 441, 3558, 15399, 10, 468, 1059, 391, 9, 27, 935, 162, 1, 454, 67, 162, 28, 2922, 7352, 1723, 28, 1250, 81, 188, 18, 3, 1230, 9451, 8756, 596, 10, 95, 6, 1191, 3, 961, 8, 906, 10, 339, 162, 4, 654, 1456, 65, 10, 173, 190, 3, 157, 906, 55, 1, 3193, 2, 7152, 4239, 1, 6240, 11853, 652, 10, 275, 4, 672, 315, 3041, 37, 4617, 348, 2, 366, 24, 5, 3558, 15399, 737, 169, 625, 7, 11, 346, 79, 2296, 52, 89, 66, 14, 60, 184, 18, 49, 6, 269, 67, 60, 5, 2403, 1, 5720, 945, 78, 49, 4214, 78, 66, 2714, 5594, 7160, 30, 78, 39, 996, 3238, 78, 18, 1973, 12478, 15458, 30, 78, 14, 393, 945, 78, 14, 2, 12169, 9576, 134, 78, 14, 3591, 7, 11, 1910, 859, 9, 155, 77, 2506, 489, 4, 3, 169, 7, 346, 28, 1250, 81, 188, 18, 61, 28, 6398, 81, 188, 18, 61, 2506, 489, 4, 100, 1, 437, 7, 110, 1, 953, 592, 88, 27, 4548, 2, 5759, 125, 11, 77, 88, 39, 385, 220, 61, 817, 88, 27, 385, 159, 7799, 2, 3655, 266, 1456, 1030, 3200, 1, 1380, 9, 3558, 15399, 11, 2235, 518, 1960, 13, 10325, 519, 805, 555, 188, 18, 2235, 433, 1, 1395, 67, 511, 259, 805, 188, 18, 2, 1634, 8, 13, 8396, 1058, 168, 14, 3558, 15399, 16, 149, 421, 4, 541, 5, 387, 1025, 441, 3, 793, 124, 215, 61, 75, 3, 27, 162, 23, 370, 20, 39, 162, 1889, 1055, 16, 6398, 81, 188, 18, 61, 1059, 391]",1695.0,21825264,Phase trial MK-0752 children refractory CNS malignancies pediatric brain consortium,0,0.0

"Survival outcomes in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor for patients undergoing radiotherapy in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results analysis.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-27,"Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare central nervous system malignancy with a poor prognosis that affects mostly young children. Although radiotherapy (RT) historically has been delayed in patients aged <3 years, emerging evidence suggests a role for RT to achieve long-term survivorship. Clinical features and age-dependent trends of RT use were evaluated for patients with ATRT. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify 144 patients with ATRT from 1973 to 2008. The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS). Clinical and treatment variables were assessed for an association with OS using Cox proportional hazards models. Landmark analysis was used to correct for immortal time bias of adjuvant RT. The median age at diagnosis was 1 year (range, 0-67 years). Gross total resection of the primary tumor was achieved in 39% of patients, and 33% of patients received RT. From 1992 to 2008, RT use increased 2.4-fold in patients aged ≤3 years. The median OS for was 10 months. In multivariate analyses, metastatic disease (hazard ratio, 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-5.23; P = .001) and RT (hazard ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.73; P = .02) were identified as independent predictors of survival. Landmark analysis confirmed a robust association between RT use and survival, which was attenuated in patients ages 4 to 17 years compared with younger patients. The current results indicated that RT may offer a significant survival benefit for patients with ATRT and that patients aged ≤3 years may derive more benefit from initial RT compared with older children. The authors concluded that prospective clinical trials are needed to examine the role of RT in the initial management of ATRT in patients aged <3 years.",Journal Article,2947.0,76.0,Atypical teratoid rhabdoid ATRT rare central nervous malignancy poor prognosis affects young children radiotherapy RT historically delayed patients aged 3 years emerging evidence suggests role RT achieve long-term survivorship Clinical features age-dependent trends RT use evaluated patients ATRT National Institute 's Surveillance Epidemiology End database identify 144 patients ATRT 1973 2008 primary endpoint median overall survival OS Clinical treatment variables assessed association OS Cox proportional hazards models Landmark correct immortal time bias adjuvant RT median age diagnosis 1 year range 0-67 years Gross total resection primary achieved 39 patients 33 patients received RT 1992 2008 RT use increased 2.4-fold patients aged ≤3 years median OS 10 months multivariate metastatic disease hazard ratio 2.83 95 confidence interval 1.53-5.23 P .001 RT hazard ratio 0.10 95 confidence interval 0.01-0.73 P .02 identified independent predictors survival Landmark confirmed robust association RT use survival attenuated patients ages 4 17 years compared younger patients current indicated RT offer significant survival benefit patients ATRT patients aged ≤3 years derive benefit initial RT compared older children authors concluded prospective clinical trials needed examine role RT initial management ATRT patients aged 3 years,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1973, 12478, 30, 11832, 16, 8, 622, 854, 1880, 398, 710, 5, 8, 334, 356, 17, 2561, 2754, 1169, 541, 242, 310, 240, 3578, 71, 85, 1612, 4, 7, 1032, 27, 60, 1478, 241, 844, 8, 200, 9, 240, 6, 1359, 319, 337, 2560, 38, 404, 2, 89, 470, 1963, 1, 240, 119, 11, 194, 9, 7, 5, 11832, 3, 657, 12, 1377, 292, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 609, 10, 95, 6, 255, 4415, 7, 5, 11832, 29, 4756, 6, 1375, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 52, 63, 25, 118, 38, 2, 24, 682, 11, 275, 9, 35, 248, 5, 118, 75, 418, 831, 1017, 274, 3829, 65, 10, 95, 6, 4883, 9, 19075, 98, 2947, 1, 249, 240, 3, 52, 89, 28, 147, 10, 14, 111, 184, 13, 598, 60, 1789, 181, 170, 1, 3, 86, 30, 10, 513, 4, 587, 1, 7, 2, 466, 1, 7, 103, 240, 29, 2846, 6, 1375, 240, 119, 101, 18, 39, 1116, 4, 7, 1032, 10021, 60, 3, 52, 118, 9, 10, 79, 53, 4, 331, 318, 113, 34, 360, 197, 18, 852, 48, 307, 268, 14, 699, 33, 382, 19, 144, 2, 240, 360, 197, 13, 79, 48, 307, 268, 13, 355, 13, 803, 19, 588, 11, 108, 22, 306, 674, 1, 25, 3829, 65, 557, 8, 1922, 248, 59, 240, 119, 2, 25, 92, 10, 2656, 4, 7, 2165, 39, 6, 269, 60, 72, 5, 773, 7, 3, 291, 99, 1103, 17, 240, 68, 1918, 8, 93, 25, 247, 9, 7, 5, 11832, 2, 17, 7, 1032, 10021, 60, 68, 3823, 80, 247, 29, 388, 240, 72, 5, 434, 541, 3, 738, 4724, 17, 482, 38, 143, 32, 575, 6, 1004, 3, 200, 1, 240, 4, 3, 388, 284, 1, 11832, 4, 7, 1032, 27, 60]",1758.0,22213196,Survival outcomes atypical teratoid rhabdoid patients undergoing radiotherapy Surveillance Epidemiology End,0,0.0
Epigenetic inactivation of the tumor suppressor BIN1 drives proliferation of SNF5-deficient tumors.,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",Cell Cycle,2012-05-15,"Emerging evidence demonstrates that subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are specifically mutated at high frequency in a variety of human cancer types. SNF5 (SMARCB1/INI1/BAF47), a core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is inactivated in the vast majority of rhabdoid tumors (RT), an aggressive type of pediatric cancer. SNF5-deficient cancers are diploid and genomically stable, suggesting that epigenetically based changes in transcription are key drivers of tumor formation caused by SNF5 loss. However, there is limited understanding of the target genes that drive cancer formation following SNF5 loss. Here we performed comparative expression analyses upon three independent SNF5-deficient cancer data sets from both human and mouse and identify downregulation of the BIN1 tumor suppressor as a conserved event in primary SNF5-deficient cancers.

Invest.,2012-07-17,"Cancer is principally considered a genetic disease, and numerous mutations are thought essential to drive its growth. However, the existence of genomically stable cancers and the emergence of mutations in genes that encode chromatin remodelers raise the possibility that perturbation of chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation are capable of driving cancer formation. Here we sequenced the exomes of 35 rhabdoid tumors, highly aggressive cancers of early childhood characterized by biallelic loss of SMARCB1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We identified an extremely low rate of mutation, with loss of SMARCB1 being essentially the sole recurrent event. Indeed, in 2 of the cancers there were no other identified mutations.

Indeed, the mutation rate in RTs is among the lowest of all cancers sequenced, with loss of SMARCB1 as essentially the sole recurrent event.

Fibroblast growth factor receptors as novel therapeutic targets in SNF5-deleted malignant rhabdoid tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2013-10-30,"Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are aggressive pediatric cancers arising in brain, kidney and soft tissues, which are characterized by loss of the tumor suppressor SNF5/SMARCB1. MRTs are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and thus a high unmet clinical need exists for novel therapies for MRT patients. SNF5 is a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex which affects gene expression by nucleosome remodeling. Here, we report that loss of SNF5 function correlates with increased expression of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) in MRT cell lines and primary tumors and that re-expression of SNF5 in MRT cells causes a marked repression of FGFR expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated impairment of SWI/SNF function leads to elevated levels of FGFR2 in human fibroblasts.

Consistent SMARCB1 homozygous deletions in epithelioid sarcoma and in a subset of myoepithelial carcinomas can be reliably detected by FISH in archival material.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2014-03-03,"Epithelioid sarcomas (ES) are mesenchymal neoplasms subclassified into distal and proximal subtypes based on their distinct clinical presentations and histologic features. Consistent loss of SMARCB1 nuclear expression has been considered as the hallmark abnormality for both subtypes, a feature shared with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of infancy (ATRT). While virtually all ATRTs harbor underlying SMARCB1 somatic or germline alterations, mechanisms of SMARCB1 inactivation in ES are less well defined. To further define mechanisms of SMARCB1 inactivation a detailed molecular analysis was performed on 40 ES (25 proximal and 15 distal ES, with classic morphology and negative SMARCB1 expression) for their genomic status of SMARCB1 and related genes encoding the SWI/SNF subunits (PBRM1, BRG1, BRM, SMARCC1/2 and ARID1A) by FISH using custom BAC probes. An additional control group was included spanning a variety of 41 soft tissue neoplasms with either rhabdoid/epithelioid features or selected histotypes previously shown to lack SMARCB1 by IHC. Furthermore, 12 ES were studied by array CGH (aCGH) and an independent TMA containing 50 additional ES cases was screened for Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) and cyclin D1 immunoexpression. Homozygous SMARCB1 deletions were found by FISH in 36/40 ES (21/25 proximal-type). One of the distal-type ES displayed homozygous SMARCB1 deletion in the tumor cells, along with a heterozygous deletion within normal tissue, finding confirmed by array CGH. None of the proximal ES lacking homozygous SMARCB1 deletions displayed alterations in other SWI/SNF subunits gene members. Among controls, only the SMARCB1-immunonegative myoepithelial carcinomas displayed SMARCB1 homozygous deletions in 3/5 cases, while no gene specific abnormalities were seen among all other histologic subtypes of sarcomas tested regardless of the SMARCB1 protein status. There was no consistent pattern of AURKA and Cyclin D1 expression. The array CGH was successful in 9/12 ES, confirming the SMARCB1 and other SWI/SNF genes copy numbers detected by FISH. Our study confirms the shared pathogenesis of proximal and distal ES, showing consistent SMARCB1 homozygous deletions. Additionally we report the first ES case associated with a SMARCB1 constitutional deletion, establishing a previously undocumented link with ATRT.

Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma with non-EWSR1-NR4A3 variant fusions correlate with rhabdoid phenotype and high-grade morphology.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2014-01-28,"Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMC) are rare soft tissue sarcomas with distinctive histology and uncertain histogenesis, characterized by Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3 (EWSR1-NR4A3) fusion in 75% of the cases. A smaller proportion of cases show NR4A3 fused to other gene partners including TATA binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15), transcription factor 12 (TCF12), and TRK-fused gene (TFG). The impact of various gene fusions on morphology and outcome has not been previously evaluated. We investigated 26 consecutive EMCs and correlated the genetic findings with morphology and clinical outcome. There were 5 females and 21 males (median age, 49.5 years). Mean size of the tumors was 11 cm. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed EWSR1-NR4A3 gene fusion in 16 cases (62%), TAF15-NR4A3 gene fusion in 7 cases (27%), and TCF12-NR4A3 gene fusion in 1 case (4%). Two cases showed only NR4A3 gene rearrangements. Morphologically, most EWSR1-rearranged tumors (10/16) showed low cellularity, minimal cytologic atypia, and low mitotic counts. In contrast, 80% of EMCs with variant (non-EWSR1) NR4A3 gene fusions (TAF15, TCF12) had high-grade morphology with increased cellularity, proliferation, and cytologic atypia, showing a plasmacytoid/rhabdoid morphology in half the cases. Follow-up showed that only 1 of 16 patients with EWSR1-rearranged tumors died of disease, in contrast to 3 (43%) of 7 TAF15-rearranged tumors. In conclusion, EMCs with variant NR4A3 gene fusions show a higher incidence of rhabdoid phenotype, high-grade morphology, and a more aggressive outcome compared with the EWSR1-NR4A3 positive tumors. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for NR4A3, along with EWSR1, may be an additional ancillary test to confirm diagnosis of EMCs.

CNS-PNETs with C19MC amplification and/or LIN28 expression comprise a distinct histogenetic diagnostic and therapeutic entity.,Acta neuropathologica,Acta Neuropathol.,2014-05-20,"Amplification of the C19MC oncogenic miRNA cluster and high LIN28 expression has been linked to a distinctly aggressive group of cerebral CNS-PNETs (group 1 CNS-PNETs) arising in young children. In this study, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic specificity of C19MC and LIN28, and the clinical and biological spectra of C19MC amplified and/or LIN28+ CNS-PNETs. We interrogated 450 pediatric brain tumors using FISH and IHC analyses and demonstrate that C19MC alteration is restricted to a sub-group of CNS-PNETs with high LIN28 expression; however, LIN28 immunopositivity was not exclusive to CNS-PNETs but was also detected in a proportion of other malignant pediatric brain tumors including rhabdoid brain tumors and malignant gliomas. C19MC amplified/LIN28+ group 1 CNS-PNETs arose predominantly in children <4 years old; a majority arose in the cerebrum but 24 % (13/54) of tumors had extra-cerebral origins. Notably, group 1 CNS-PNETs encompassed several histologic classes including embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), medulloepithelioma, ependymoblastoma and CNS-PNETs with variable differentiation.

Mechanisms by which SMARCB1 loss drives rhabdoid tumor growth.,Cancer genetics,Cancer Genet,2014-04-13,"SMARCB1 (INI1/SNF5/BAF47), a core subunit of the SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is inactivated in the large majority of rhabdoid tumors, and germline heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations form the basis for rhabdoid predisposition syndrome. Mouse models validated Smarcb1 as a bona fide tumor suppressor, as Smarcb1 inactivation in mice results in 100% of the animals rapidly developing cancer. SMARCB1 was the first subunit of the SWI/SNF complex found mutated in cancer. More recently, at least seven other genes encoding SWI/SNF subunits have been identified as recurrently mutated in cancer. Collectively, 20% of all human cancers contain a SWI/SNF mutation. Consequently, investigation of the mechanisms by which SMARCB1 mutation causes cancer has relevance not only for rhabdoid tumors, but also potentially for the wide variety of SWI/SNF mutant cancers. Here we discuss normal functions of SMARCB1 and the SWI/SNF complex as well as mechanistic and potentially therapeutic insights that have emerged.

Use of clinical next-generation sequencing to identify melanomas harboring SMARCB1 mutations.,Journal of cutaneous pathology,J. Cutan. Pathol.,2015-03-24,"SMARCB1 (INI1/BAF47/SNF5) encodes a part of a multiprotein complex that regulates gene expression through chromatin remodeling. SMARCB1 expression is lost or downregulated in multiple human tumors, including epithelioid sarcoma, meningioma and rhabdoid tumors of the brain, soft tissue and kidney. A 46-gene or 50-gene next-generation sequencing AmpliSeq Cancer Panel (Life Technologies; San Francisco, CA, USA) was applied to ∼1400 primary or metastatic melanoma tissues. We identified eight cases of melanoma harboring mutations in SMARCB1. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated preservation of SMARCB1 protein expression in all cases. SMARCB1 mutations occurred together with TP53 mutations in five of the eight cases, suggesting a functional relationship between these tumor suppressors in melanoma. Because single-base substitutions in SMARCB1 occur in a small subset of melanomas and do not affect SMARCB1 protein expression, such mutations would only be discovered by sequencing approaches. Our findings highlight the potential for next-generation sequencing platforms to identify mutations unexpected for melanoma that may contribute to its oncogenic potential.

Molecular subgroups of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours in children: an integrated genomic and clinicopathological analysis.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2015-04-14,"Rhabdoid brain tumours, also called atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours, are lethal childhood cancers with characteristic genetic alterations of SMARCB1/hSNF5. Lack of biological understanding of the substantial clinical heterogeneity of these tumours restricts therapeutic advances. We integrated genomic and clinicopathological analyses of a cohort of patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours to find out the molecular basis for clinical heterogeneity in these tumours. We obtained 259 rhabdoid tumours from 37 international institutions and assessed transcriptional profiles in 43 primary tumours and copy number profiles in 38 primary tumours to discover molecular subgroups of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours. We used gene and pathway enrichment analyses to discover group-specific molecular markers and did immunohistochemical analyses on 125 primary tumours to evaluate clinicopathological significance of molecular subgroup and ASCL1-NOTCH signalling. Transcriptional analyses identified two atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour subgroups with differential enrichment of genetic pathways, and distinct clinicopathological and survival features. Expression of ASCL1, a regulator of NOTCH signalling, correlated with supratentorial location (p=0·004) and superior 5-year overall survival (35%, 95% CI 13-57, and 20%, 6-34, for ASCL1-positive and ASCL1-negative tumours, respectively; p=0·033) in 70 patients who received multimodal treatment. ASCL1 expression also correlated with superior 5-year overall survival (34%, 7-61, and 9%, 0-21, for ASCL1-positive and ASCL1-negative tumours, respectively; p=0·001) in 39 patients who received only chemotherapy without radiation. Cox hazard ratios for overall survival in patients with differential ASCL1 enrichment treated with chemotherapy with or without radiation were 2·02 (95% CI 1·04-3·85; p=0·038) and 3·98 (1·71-9·26; p=0·001). Integrated analyses of molecular subgroupings with clinical prognostic factors showed three distinct clinical risk groups of tumours with different therapeutic outcomes. An integration of clinical risk factors and tumour molecular groups can be used to identify patients who are likely to have improved long-term radiation-free survival and might help therapeutic stratification of patients with atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours.

Intratumoral morphologic and molecular heterogeneity of rhabdoid renal cell carcinoma: challenges for personalized therapy.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2015-06-26,"Rhabdoid histology in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis. The prognosis of patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma may also be influenced by molecular alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between histologic features and salient molecular changes in rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. We macrodissected the rhabdoid and clear-cell epithelioid components from 12 cases of rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. We assessed cancer-related mutations from eight cases using a clinical next-generation exome-sequencing platform. The transcriptome of rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (n=8) and non-rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (n=37) was assessed by RNA-seq and gene expression microarray. VHL (63%) showed identical mutations in all regions from the same tumor. BAP1 (38%) and PBRM1 (13%) mutations were identified in the rhabdoid but not in the epithelioid component and were mutually exclusive in 3/3 cases and 1 case, respectively. SETD2 (63%) mutations were discordant between different histologic regions in 2/5 cases, with mutations called only in the epithelioid and rhabdoid components, respectively. The transcriptome of rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma was distinct from advanced-stage and high-grade clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. The diverse histologic components of rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, however, showed a similar transcriptomic program, including a similar prognostic gene expression signature. Rhabdoid clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is transcriptomically distinct and shows a high rate of SETD2 and BAP1 mutations and a low rate of PBRM1 mutations.

Adult Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumors.,World neurosurgery,World Neurosurg,2015-09-04,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are highly malignant neoplasms that rarely occur in adults. Due to the complex histology of AT/RTs, the differential diagnosis of these tumors is quite challenging and increasingly relies on demonstration of characteristic SMARCB1/INI1 inactivation in tumor cells. A 51-year-old man presented with diplopia, lethargy, and memory deficit owing to Parinaud syndrome and hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a T2-hyperintense and homogeneously enhancing tectal mass that extended to the pineal region. Initial biopsy suggested a World Health Organization grade II myxopapillary astrocytoma. However, subsequent definitive resection revealed an AT/RT, with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 observed through immunohistochemical staining as well as array cytogenetic analysis. Molecular profiling revealed additional mutations in RHPN2(L385I), MDM4(D396G), FLT3(V194M), and NPRL3(D53N). Pathologic diagnoses in the modern era increasingly integrate molecular data for confirmation as well as prognostication. We present a rare case of a tectal AT/RT in an adult patient and report several novel mutations previously unrecognized in this tumor subtype, in addition to canonical SMARCB1/INI1 loss.

The genomic landscape of epithelioid sarcoma cell lines and tumours.,The Journal of pathology,J. Pathol.,2015-10-19,"We carried out whole genome and transcriptome sequencing on four tumour/normal pairs of epithelioid sarcoma. These index cases were supplemented with whole transcriptome sequencing of three additional tumours and three cell lines. Unlike rhabdoid tumour (the other major group of SMARCB1-negative cancers), epithelioid sarcoma shows a complex genome with a higher mutational rate, comparable to that of ovarian carcinoma. Despite this mutational burden, SMARCB1 mutations remain the most frequently recurring event and are probably critical drivers of tumour formation. Several cases show heterozygous SMARCB1 mutations without inactivation of the second allele, and we explore this further in vitro. Finding CDKN2A deletions in our discovery cohort, we evaluated CDKN2A protein expression in a tissue microarray. Six out of 16 cases had lost CDKN2A in greater than or equal to 90% of cells, while the remaining cases had retained the protein. Expression analysis of epithelioid sarcoma cell lines by transcriptome sequencing shows a unique profile that does not cluster with any particular tissue type or with other SWI/SNF-aberrant lines. Evaluation of the levels of members of the SWI/SNF complex other than SMARCB1 revealed that these proteins are expressed as part of a residual complex, similarly to previously studied rhabdoid tumour lines. This residual SWI/SNF is susceptible to synthetic lethality and may therefore indicate a therapeutic opportunity.",Journal Article,1555.0,19.0,carried genome transcriptome sequencing tumour/normal pairs epithelioid sarcoma index cases supplemented transcriptome sequencing additional tumours lines Unlike rhabdoid tumour major group SMARCB1-negative epithelioid sarcoma shows complex genome higher rate comparable ovarian carcinoma Despite burden SMARCB1 remain frequently recurring event probably critical drivers tumour formation cases heterozygous SMARCB1 inactivation second allele explore vitro Finding CDKN2A deletions discovery cohort evaluated CDKN2A expression tissue microarray 16 cases lost CDKN2A greater equal 90 remaining cases retained Expression epithelioid sarcoma lines transcriptome sequencing shows unique profile cluster particular tissue type SWI/SNF-aberrant lines Evaluation levels members SWI/SNF complex SMARCB1 revealed expressed residual complex similarly previously studied rhabdoid tumour lines residual SWI/SNF susceptible synthetic lethality indicate therapeutic opportunity,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 2629, 1205, 902, 898, 2, 3917, 615, 23, 294, 770, 295, 2773, 1, 3838, 46, 558, 140, 11, 7687, 5, 902, 3917, 615, 1, 169, 402, 1319, 2, 169, 31, 285, 4246, 770, 3, 127, 458, 87, 1, 5952, 199, 163, 3838, 1949, 8, 840, 898, 5, 8, 142, 1619, 116, 1279, 6, 17, 1, 134, 550, 26, 1619, 892, 5952, 138, 918, 3, 96, 746, 6385, 774, 2, 32, 4061, 740, 3391, 1, 770, 1264, 392, 140, 514, 4167, 5952, 138, 187, 2297, 1, 3, 419, 1254, 2, 21, 1645, 26, 195, 4, 439, 1567, 3175, 2439, 4, 114, 1574, 180, 21, 194, 3175, 178, 55, 4, 8, 246, 1727, 437, 1205, 1, 245, 140, 42, 3009, 3175, 4, 378, 76, 15, 2997, 6, 424, 1, 37, 369, 3, 1844, 140, 42, 3532, 3, 178, 55, 65, 1, 3838, 31, 285, 20, 3917, 615, 1949, 8, 991, 800, 17, 1097, 44, 3132, 5, 500, 1454, 246, 267, 15, 5, 127, 4983, 5071, 1898, 285, 451, 1, 3, 148, 1, 1684, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 840, 127, 76, 5952, 553, 17, 46, 652, 32, 570, 22, 760, 1, 8, 753, 840, 1813, 6, 373, 656, 770, 285, 26, 753, 4983, 5071, 16, 4012, 6, 3273, 3266, 2, 68, 673, 1008, 8, 189, 2666]",1391.0,26365879,genomic landscape epithelioid sarcoma lines tumours,0,0.0
"Molecular analyses reveal close similarities between small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.",Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-01-01,"Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is the most common undifferentiated ovarian malignancy diagnosed in women under age 40. We and others recently determined that germline and/or somatic deleterious mutations in SMARCA4 characterize SCCOHT. Alterations in this gene, or the related SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling gene SMARCB1, have been previously reported in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) and malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs). To further describe the somatic landscape of SCCOHT, we performed whole exome sequencing on 14 tumors and their matched normal tissues and compared their genomic alterations with those in ATRT and ovarian high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). We confirmed that SMARCA4 is the only recurrently mutated gene in SCCOHT, and show that recurrent allelic imbalance is observed exclusively on chromosome 19p, where SMARCA4 resides. By comparing genomic alterations between SCCOHT, ATRT and HGSC, we demonstrate that SCCOHTs, like ATRTs, have a remarkably simple genome and harbor significantly fewer somatic protein-coding mutations and chromosomal alterations than HGSC. Furthermore, a comparison of global DNA methylation profiles of 45 SCCOHTs, 65 ATRTs, and 92 HGSCs demonstrates a strong epigenetic correlation between SCCOHT and ATRT. Our results further confirm that the genomic and epigenomic signatures of SCCOHT are more similar to those of ATRT than HGSC, supporting our previous hypothesis that SCCOHT is a rhabdoid tumor and should be renamed MRT of the ovary. Furthermore, we conclude that SMARCA4 inactivation is the main cause of SCCOHT, and that new distinct therapeutic approaches should be developed to specifically target this devastating tumor.",Journal Article,1481.0,19.0,Small carcinoma ovary hypercalcemic type SCCOHT common undifferentiated ovarian malignancy diagnosed women age 40 recently determined germline and/or somatic deleterious SMARCA4 characterize SCCOHT Alterations related SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling SMARCB1 previously reported atypical teratoid/rhabdoid ATRTs malignant rhabdoid MRTs somatic landscape SCCOHT performed exome sequencing 14 matched normal tissues compared genomic alterations ATRT ovarian high grade serous carcinoma HGSC confirmed SMARCA4 recurrently SCCOHT recurrent allelic imbalance observed exclusively chromosome 19p SMARCA4 resides comparing genomic alterations SCCOHT ATRT HGSC demonstrate SCCOHTs like ATRTs remarkably simple genome harbor significantly fewer somatic protein-coding chromosomal alterations HGSC Furthermore comparison global DNA methylation profiles 45 SCCOHTs 65 ATRTs 92 HGSCs demonstrates strong epigenetic correlation SCCOHT ATRT confirm genomic epigenomic signatures SCCOHT similar ATRT HGSC supporting previous hypothesis SCCOHT rhabdoid renamed MRT ovary Furthermore conclude SMARCA4 inactivation main cause SCCOHT new distinct therapeutic approaches developed specifically target devastating,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[302, 31, 134, 1, 3, 3631, 24534, 267, 22913, 16, 3, 96, 186, 4480, 710, 265, 4, 117, 669, 89, 327, 21, 2, 1749, 761, 509, 17, 1009, 2, 15, 1119, 3586, 138, 4, 12457, 1507, 22913, 593, 4, 26, 145, 15, 3, 139, 4983, 5071, 2287, 4429, 145, 5952, 47, 85, 373, 210, 4, 1973, 12478, 15458, 57, 17541, 2, 393, 57, 12654, 6, 195, 897, 3, 1119, 2801, 1, 22913, 21, 173, 902, 2865, 615, 23, 213, 57, 2, 136, 655, 295, 742, 2, 72, 136, 572, 593, 5, 135, 4, 11832, 2, 64, 88, 1744, 134, 9144, 21, 557, 17, 12457, 16, 3, 158, 8820, 1185, 145, 4, 22913, 2, 514, 17, 387, 3861, 6088, 16, 164, 4437, 23, 1170, 31492, 1257, 12457, 16610, 20, 1430, 572, 593, 59, 22913, 11832, 2, 9144, 21, 608, 17, 49451, 733, 17541, 47, 8, 4856, 2763, 898, 2, 2760, 97, 1497, 1119, 178, 3097, 138, 2, 1860, 593, 76, 9144, 798, 8, 1155, 1, 1648, 261, 569, 1241, 1, 512, 49451, 556, 17541, 2, 937, 17536, 1902, 8, 1082, 1418, 816, 59, 22913, 2, 11832, 114, 99, 195, 1843, 17, 3, 572, 2, 9822, 2210, 1, 22913, 32, 80, 288, 6, 135, 1, 11832, 76, 9144, 1912, 114, 698, 1492, 17, 22913, 16, 8, 30, 2, 257, 40, 34349, 11848, 1, 3, 3631, 798, 21, 2060, 17, 12457, 2297, 16, 3, 1895, 708, 1, 22913, 2, 17, 217, 834, 189, 611, 257, 40, 276, 6, 1225, 283, 26, 5778, 30]",1654.0,26646792,Molecular reveal close similarities small carcinoma ovary hypercalcemic type atypical teratoid/rhabdoid,0,0.0
"Recurrent CIC Gene Abnormalities in Angiosarcomas: A Molecular Study of 120 Cases With Concurrent Investigation of PLCG1, KDR, MYC, and FLT4 Gene Alterations.",The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2016-05-01,"Angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare sarcoma subtype showing considerable clinicopathologic and genetic heterogeneity. Most radiation-induced AS show MYC gene amplifications, with a subset of cases harboring KDR, PTPRB, and PLCG1 mutations. Despite recent advances, the genetic abnormalities of most primary AS remain undefined. Whole-transcriptome sequencing was initiated in 2 index cases of primary soft tissue AS with epithelioid morphology occurring in young adults for novel gene discovery. The candidate abnormalities were validated and then screened by targeted sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization in a large cohort of 120 well-characterized AS cases. Findings were subsequently correlated with the status of KDR, PLCG1, MYC, and FLT4 gene abnormalities. The clinicopathologic relevance and prognostic significance of these genetic changes were analyzed by statistical methods. Concurrent CIC mutations and CIC rearrangements were identified in both index cases, with a CIC-LEUTX fusion detected in 1 case. Upon screening, an additional visceral AS in a young adult had a complex CIC rearrangement, whereas 6 others harbored only CIC mutations. All 3 CIC-rearranged AS cases lacked vasoformation and had a solid growth of round, epithelioid to rhabdoid cells, showing immunoreactivity for CD31 and Ets-related gene and sharing a transcriptional signature with other round cell sarcomas, including CIC-rearranged tumors. Overall, CIC abnormalities occurred in 9% (9/98) of cases, affecting younger patients with primary AS, with an inferior disease-free survival. In contrast, PLCG1 and KDR mutations occurred in both primary and secondary AS cases, accounting for 9.5% and 7%, respectively, with a predilection for breast and bone/viscera location, regardless of MYC status.

"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors-current concepts, advances in biology, and potential future therapies.",Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2016-01-10,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is the most common malignant CNS tumor of children below 6 months of age. The majority of AT/RTs demonstrate genomic alterations in SMARCB1 (INI1, SNF5, BAF47) or, to a lesser extent, SMARCA4 (BRG1) of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable chromatin remodeling complex. Recent transcription and methylation profiling studies suggest the existence of molecular subgroups. Thus, at the root of these seemingly enigmatic tumors lies a network of factors related to epigenetic regulation, which is not yet completely understood. While conventional-type chemotherapy may have significant survival benefit for certain patients, it remains to be determined which patients will eventually prove resistant to chemotherapy and thus need novel therapeutic strategies. Elucidation of the molecular consequences of a disturbed epigenome has led to the identification of a series of transduction cascades, which may be targeted for therapy. Among these are the pathways of cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, Hedgehog/GLI1, Wnt/ß-catenin, enhancer of zeste homolog 2, and aurora kinase A, among others.

Inhibition of DNA damage repair by the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib delays irradiated intracranial atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor and glioblastoma xenograft regrowth.,Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2016-07-01,"Radiation therapy is the most commonly used postsurgical treatment for primary malignant brain tumors. Consequently, investigating the efficacy of chemotherapeutics combined with radiation for treating malignant brain tumors is of high clinical relevance. In this study, we examined the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, when used in combination with radiation for treating human atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) as well as glioblastoma (GBM). Evaluation of treatment antitumor activity in vitro was based upon results from cell proliferation assays, clonogenicity assays, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry for DNA double-strand break repair. Interpretation of treatment antitumor activity in vivo was based upon bioluminescence imaging, animal subject survival analysis, and staining of tumor sections for markers of proliferation and apoptosis. For each of the retinoblastoma protein (RB)-proficient tumor models examined (2 ATRTs and 2 GBMs), one or more of the combination therapy regimens significantly (P < .05) outperformed both monotherapies with respect to animal subject survival benefit. Among the combination therapy regimens, concurrent palbociclib and radiation treatment and palbociclib treatment following radiation consistently outperformed the sequence in which radiation followed palbociclib treatment. In vitro investigation revealed that the concurrent use of palbociclib with radiation, as well as palbociclib following radiation, inhibited DNA double-strand break repair and promoted increased tumor cell apoptosis.

Prognostic factors and survival in non-central nervous system rhabdoid tumors.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2016-08-31,"Non-central nervous system (non-CNS) rhabdoid tumors tend to present at a young age and have an extremely aggressive course, with dismal overall survival rates. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 has been shown in rhabdoid tumors regardless of anatomic location, suggesting a common genetic basis. We retrospectively analyzed our institutional experience with non-CNS rhabdoid tumors to determine overall survival and prognostic variables. We reviewed records of pediatric patients (age<22y) with non-CNS rhabdoid tumor at our institution between 1980 and 2014. Variables evaluated for correlation with survival included: age > or <1.5years (median) at diagnosis, M1 status, and radiation therapy. The log-rank test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier probability distributions with P values adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate approach. Nineteen consecutive patients (10 female) with histologically verified rhabdoid tumor were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 3.2years (median 1.5y, range 1.3mo-21.8y). Primary tumors were located in the kidney (n=10), head and neck (n=5), and in the liver, thigh, mediastinum and retroperitoneum (n=1 each). SMARCB1 expression was absent in all 10 patients tested. Eight patients had distant metastases at diagnosis. Median overall survival was 1.2years. Age greater than the median and radiation therapy were associated with better outcome, with a median overall survival of 2.7years (P=0.049 and P=0.003, respectively). Survival rates for rhabdoid tumor remain poor, but prognosis is better in older children, regardless of primary tumor location.

SMARCB1-mediated SWI/SNF complex function is essential for enhancer regulation.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2016-12-12,"SMARCB1 (also known as SNF5, INI1, and BAF47), a core subunit of the SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is inactivated in nearly all pediatric rhabdoid tumors. These aggressive cancers are among the most genomically stable, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism by which SMARCB1 loss drives transformation. Here we show that, despite having indistinguishable mutational landscapes, human rhabdoid tumors exhibit distinct enhancer H3K27ac signatures, which identify remnants of differentiation programs.

Integrated (epi)-Genomic Analyses Identify Subgroup-Specific Therapeutic Targets in CNS Rhabdoid Tumors.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2016-12-01,"We recently reported that atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) comprise at least two transcriptional subtypes with different clinical outcomes; however, the mechanisms underlying therapeutic heterogeneity remained unclear. In this study, we analyzed 191 primary ATRTs and 10 ATRT cell lines to define the genomic and epigenomic landscape of ATRTs and identify subgroup-specific therapeutic targets. We found ATRTs segregated into three epigenetic subgroups with distinct genomic profiles, SMARCB1 genotypes, and chromatin landscape that correlated with differential cellular responses to a panel of signaling and epigenetic inhibitors.

Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas.,Neuro-oncology,Neuro-oncology,2017-04-01,"Patients with meningiomas have widely divergent clinical courses. Some entirely recover following surgery alone, while others have relentless tumor recurrences. This clinical conundrum is exemplified by rhabdoid meningiomas, which are designated in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours as high grade, despite only a subset following an aggressive clinical course. Patient management decisions are further exacerbated by high rates of interobserver variability, biased against missing possibly aggressive tumors. Objective molecular determinants are needed to guide classification and clinical decision making. To define genomic aberrations of rhabdoid meningiomas, we performed sequencing of cancer-related genes in 27 meningiomas from 18 patients with rhabdoid features and evaluated breast cancer [BRCA]1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression by immunohistochemistry in 336 meningiomas. We assessed outcomes, germline status, and family history in patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas. The tumor suppressor gene BAP1, a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, is inactivated in a subset of high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas. Patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas had reduced time to recurrence compared with patients with BAP1-retained rhabdoid meningiomas (Kaplan-Meier analysis, 26 mo vs 116 mo, P < .001; hazard ratio 12.89). A subset of patients with BAP1-deficient rhabdoid meningiomas harbored germline BAP1 mutations, indicating that rhabdoid meningiomas can be a harbinger of the BAP1 cancer predisposition syndrome. We define a subset of aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas that can be recognized using routine laboratory tests. We implicate ubiquitin deregulation in the pathogenesis of these high-grade malignancies. In addition, we show that familial and sporadic BAP1-mutated rhabdoid meningiomas are clinically aggressive, requiring intensive clinical management.",Journal Article,1025.0,35.0,Patients meningiomas widely divergent clinical courses entirely recover following surgery relentless recurrences clinical conundrum exemplified rhabdoid meningiomas designated World Health Organization Classification Tumours high grade despite subset following aggressive clinical course Patient management decisions exacerbated high rates interobserver variability biased missing possibly aggressive Objective molecular determinants needed guide classification clinical decision making define genomic aberrations rhabdoid meningiomas performed sequencing cancer-related 27 meningiomas 18 patients rhabdoid features evaluated breast BRCA 1-associated 1 BAP1 expression immunohistochemistry 336 meningiomas assessed outcomes germline status family history patients BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas suppressor BAP1 ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase inactivated subset high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas Patients BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas reduced time recurrence compared patients BAP1-retained rhabdoid meningiomas Kaplan-Meier 26 mo vs 116 mo P .001 hazard ratio 12.89 subset patients BAP1-deficient rhabdoid meningiomas harbored germline BAP1 indicating rhabdoid meningiomas harbinger BAP1 predisposition syndrome define subset aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas recognized routine laboratory tests implicate ubiquitin deregulation pathogenesis high-grade malignancies addition familial sporadic BAP1-mutated rhabdoid meningiomas clinically aggressive requiring intensive clinical management,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7, 5, 3718, 47, 1792, 8332, 38, 1993, 476, 6848, 9966, 366, 152, 279, 369, 1749, 47, 23554, 30, 1593, 26, 38, 23536, 16, 14225, 20, 3718, 92, 32, 4107, 4, 3, 1956, 341, 2533, 947, 1, 1319, 22, 64, 88, 550, 158, 8, 697, 366, 35, 571, 38, 906, 69, 284, 1526, 32, 195, 10545, 20, 64, 151, 1, 5393, 1982, 11627, 480, 4593, 2150, 571, 57, 461, 219, 3403, 32, 575, 6, 1597, 947, 2, 38, 948, 1079, 6, 1107, 572, 2152, 1, 3718, 21, 173, 615, 1, 12, 139, 214, 4, 428, 3718, 29, 203, 7, 5, 404, 2, 194, 12, 1555, 14, 41, 178, 14, 5113, 55, 20, 888, 4, 10047, 3718, 21, 275, 123, 1009, 156, 2, 607, 532, 4, 7, 5, 5113, 199, 3718, 3, 30, 1245, 145, 5113, 8, 4213, 17955, 2158, 18796, 16, 5458, 4, 8, 697, 1, 64, 88, 3718, 7, 5, 5113, 199, 3718, 42, 405, 98, 6, 146, 72, 5, 7, 5, 5113, 3532, 3718, 876, 882, 65, 432, 2035, 105, 3790, 2035, 19, 144, 360, 197, 133, 887, 8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 5113, 1971, 3718, 3253, 1009, 5113, 138, 1716, 17, 3718, 122, 40, 8, 24796, 1, 3, 5113, 12, 2863, 681, 21, 1107, 8, 697, 1, 571, 3718, 17, 122, 40, 1904, 75, 1311, 1624, 895, 21, 5545, 4213, 4765, 4, 3, 1384, 1, 46, 64, 88, 441, 4, 352, 21, 514, 17, 2200, 2, 1928, 5113, 1185, 3718, 32, 505, 571, 1888, 1686, 38, 284]",1773.0,28170043,Germline somatic BAP1 high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas,29,0.453125
Sarcomas With CIC-rearrangements Are a Distinct Pathologic Entity With Aggressive Outcome: A Clinicopathologic and Molecular Study of 115 Cases.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2017-07-01,"CIC-DUX4 gene fusion, resulting from either a t(4;19) or t(10;19) translocation, is the most common genetic abnormality detected in EWSR1-negative small blue round cell tumors. Following their discovery it was debated if these tumors should be classified as variants of Ewing sarcoma (ie, atypical Ewing sarcoma) or as a stand-alone pathologic entity. As such the WHO classification temporarily grouped the CIC-rearranged tumors under undifferentiated sarcomas with round cell phenotype, until further clinical evidence was available. However, most studies reported so far include small series with limited follow-up information, which preclude a more definitive assessment. The present work investigates the clinicopathologic features of a large cohort of sarcomas with CIC gene rearrangement, to define their clinical presentation, morphologic spectrum, and outcome. Our study further examines the overall survival of the CIC-positive cohort compared with a control group of EWSR1-rearranged Ewing sarcoma matched for age and stage. The study cohort included 115 patients, with a mean age of 32 years and a slight male predominance. Most tumors occurred in the soft tissue (86%), predominantly deep-seated and equally divided among trunk and extremity, followed by visceral locations (12%) and rarely in the bone (3%). Microscopically, most tumors showed round to ovoid cytomorphology but half of the cases showed also focal areas of spindling and epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype, with frequent myxoid stromal changes. Variable CD99 reactivity was seen in 84% cases, with a diffuse pattern only in 23% of cases, whereas nuclear WT1 was seen in 92%. A CIC-DUX4 fusion was detected in 57% of cases, with either DUX4 on 4q35 (35%) or on 10q26 in 25 (22%) cases. No FOXO4 gene rearrangements were present in 39 cases tested. Clinical follow-up was available in 57 patients, with a 5-year survival of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival in the control Ewing sarcoma group (P=0.002). Our findings show that CIC-DUX4 sarcomas occur most commonly in young adults within the somatic soft tissues, having a wide spectrum of morphology including round, epithelioid and spindle cells, and associated with an aggressive clinical course, with an inferior overall survival compared with Ewing sarcoma. The results support the classification of CIC-rearranged tumors as an independent molecular and clinical subset of small blue round cell tumors distinct from Ewing sarcoma.",Journal Article,934.0,63.0,CIC-DUX4 fusion resulting 4 19 10 19 translocation common genetic abnormality detected EWSR1-negative small blue round Following discovery debated classified Ewing sarcoma atypical Ewing sarcoma stand-alone pathologic entity classification temporarily grouped CIC-rearranged undifferentiated sarcomas round phenotype clinical evidence available studies reported far include small series limited follow-up information preclude definitive assessment present work investigates clinicopathologic features large cohort sarcomas CIC rearrangement define clinical presentation morphologic spectrum outcome examines overall survival CIC-positive cohort compared control group EWSR1-rearranged Ewing sarcoma matched age stage cohort included 115 patients mean age 32 years slight male predominance occurred soft tissue 86 predominantly deep-seated equally divided trunk extremity followed visceral locations 12 rarely bone 3 Microscopically showed round ovoid cytomorphology half cases showed focal areas spindling epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype frequent myxoid stromal changes Variable CD99 reactivity seen 84 cases diffuse pattern 23 cases nuclear WT1 seen 92 CIC-DUX4 fusion detected 57 cases DUX4 4q35 35 10q26 25 22 cases FOXO4 rearrangements present 39 cases tested Clinical follow-up available 57 patients 5-year survival 43 significantly lower 77 5-year survival control Ewing sarcoma group P=0.002 findings CIC-DUX4 sarcomas occur commonly young adults somatic soft tissues wide spectrum morphology including round epithelioid spindle associated aggressive clinical course inferior overall survival compared Ewing sarcoma support classification CIC-rearranged independent molecular clinical subset small blue round distinct Ewing sarcoma,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8553, 18043, 145, 1212, 1113, 29, 361, 8, 102, 39, 326, 15, 102, 79, 326, 2006, 16, 3, 96, 186, 336, 3698, 530, 4, 6620, 199, 302, 3352, 4436, 31, 57, 366, 136, 1574, 192, 10, 7755, 492, 46, 57, 257, 40, 1373, 22, 839, 1, 2523, 1973, 15, 22, 8, 9959, 279, 510, 2983, 22, 225, 3, 54, 947, 17734, 3706, 3, 8553, 3201, 57, 669, 4480, 1479, 5, 4436, 31, 1005, 1100, 195, 38, 241, 10, 390, 137, 96, 94, 210, 1743, 3272, 643, 302, 988, 5, 383, 166, 126, 487, 92, 6064, 8, 80, 1057, 455, 3, 364, 1357, 7259, 3, 1399, 404, 1, 8, 375, 180, 1, 1479, 5, 8553, 145, 2675, 6, 1107, 136, 38, 1031, 2815, 1873, 2, 228, 114, 45, 195, 4468, 3, 63, 25, 1, 3, 8553, 109, 180, 72, 5, 8, 182, 87, 1, 6620, 3201, 655, 9, 89, 2, 82, 3, 45, 180, 159, 3670, 7, 5, 8, 313, 89, 1, 531, 60, 2, 8, 8041, 1045, 7593, 96, 57, 489, 4, 3, 1214, 246, 868, 2117, 2369, 21419, 2, 4142, 2176, 107, 5895, 2, 2678, 370, 20, 2737, 4069, 133, 2, 2416, 4, 3, 27, 7187, 96, 57, 224, 4436, 6, 15300, 14729, 84, 1303, 1, 3, 140, 224, 120, 2137, 1361, 1, 46080, 2, 3838, 15458, 1005, 5, 908, 5707, 1126, 400, 1347, 13940, 4601, 10, 527, 4, 874, 140, 5, 8, 1388, 1177, 158, 4, 382, 1, 140, 547, 928, 3722, 10, 527, 4, 937, 8, 8553, 18043, 1212, 10, 530, 4, 696, 1, 140, 5, 361, 18043, 23, 29218, 465, 15, 23, 19620, 4, 243, 350, 140, 77, 32723, 145, 2072, 11, 364, 4, 587, 140, 650, 38, 166, 126, 10, 390, 4, 696, 7, 5, 8, 33, 111, 25, 1, 601, 92, 10, 97, 280, 76, 3, 849, 33, 111, 25, 4, 3, 182, 87, 19, 13, 1111, 114, 272, 514, 17, 8553, 18043, 1479, 1271, 96, 841, 4, 1169, 857, 262, 3, 1119, 1214, 742, 1041, 8, 1019, 1873, 1, 2567, 141, 4436, 3838, 2, 4052, 37, 2, 41, 5, 35, 571, 38, 906, 5, 35, 1663, 63, 25, 72, 5, 3, 99, 538, 3, 947, 1, 8553, 3201, 57, 22, 35, 306, 219, 2, 38, 697, 1, 302, 3352, 4436, 31, 57, 834, 29]",2334.0,28346326,Sarcomas CIC-rearrangements Distinct Pathologic Entity Aggressive Outcome Clinicopathologic Molecular 115 Cases,7,0.109375

Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control and real-time PK.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-two patients (median age, 5.5 years) received ribociclib 280, 350, or 470 mg/m<sup>2</sup> Three patients had dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 fatigue (280 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>n</i> = 1) or grade 4 thrombocytopenia (470 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>n</i> = 2). Most common treatment-related adverse events (AE) were hematologic: neutropenia (72% all-grade/63% grade 3/4), leukopenia (63%/38%), anemia (44%/3%), thrombocytopenia (44%/28%), and lymphopenia (38%/19%), followed by vomiting (38%/0%), fatigue (25%/3%), nausea (25%/0%), and QTc prolongation (22%/0%). Ribociclib exposure was dose-dependent at 350 and 470 mg/m<sup>2</sup> [equivalent to 600 (RP2D)-900 mg in adults], with high interpatient variability. Best overall response was stable disease (SD) in nine patients (seven with neuroblastoma, two with primary CNS MRT); five patients achieved SD for more than 6, 6, 8, 12, and 13 cycles, respectively.<b>Conclusions:</b> Ribociclib demonstrated acceptable safety and PK in pediatric patients. MTD (470 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and RP2D (350 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were equivalent to those in adults. Observations of prolonged SD support further investigation of ribociclib combined with other agents in neuroblastoma and MRT. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(10); 2433-41. ©2017 AACR</i>.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",1005.0,35.0,b Purpose /b cyclin-dependent kinase CDK 4/6 inhibitor ribociclib LEE011 displayed preclinical activity neuroblastoma malignant rhabdoid MRT models phase maximum tolerated dose MTD recommended phase II dose RP2D safety pharmacokinetics PK preliminary activity single-agent ribociclib investigated pediatric patients neuroblastoma MRT cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-retinoblastoma pathway-altered tumors. b Experimental Design /b Patients aged 1-21 years received escalating once-daily oral doses ribociclib 3-weeks-on/1-week-off Dose escalation guided Bayesian logistic regression model overdose control real-time PK. b /b Thirty-two patients median age 5.5 years received ribociclib 280 350 470 mg/m sup 2 /sup patients dose-limiting toxicities grade 3 fatigue 280 mg/m sup 2 /sup n /i 1 grade 4 thrombocytopenia 470 mg/m sup 2 /sup n /i 2 common treatment-related adverse events AE hematologic neutropenia 72 all-grade/63 grade 3/4 leukopenia 63 /38 anemia 44 /3 thrombocytopenia 44 /28 lymphopenia 38 /19 followed vomiting 38 /0 fatigue 25 /3 nausea 25 /0 QTc prolongation 22 /0 Ribociclib exposure dose-dependent 350 470 mg/m sup 2 /sup equivalent 600 RP2D -900 mg adults high interpatient variability Best overall response stable disease SD patients seven neuroblastoma primary CNS MRT patients achieved SD 6 6 8 12 13 cycles respectively. b Conclusions /b Ribociclib demonstrated acceptable safety PK pediatric patients MTD 470 mg/m sup 2 /sup RP2D 350 mg/m sup 2 /sup equivalent adults Observations prolonged SD support investigation ribociclib combined agents neuroblastoma MRT Clin Res 23 10 2433-41 ©2017 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[132, 743, 132, 3, 1226, 470, 216, 3954, 39, 49, 230, 7342, 18081, 2507, 693, 128, 4, 2, 393, 30, 11848, 274, 4, 26, 124, 70, 45, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 2, 793, 124, 215, 61, 3977, 367, 1159, 2395, 2, 1676, 128, 1, 226, 420, 7342, 11, 565, 4, 815, 7, 5, 11848, 15, 127, 1226, 427, 3254, 49, 19792, 18175, 308, 1495, 57, 132, 1560, 771, 132, 7, 1032, 14, 239, 60, 103, 2922, 1059, 391, 518, 415, 1, 7342, 27, 244, 23, 14, 647, 1889, 61, 1125, 10, 1808, 20, 8, 5032, 812, 320, 202, 5, 19809, 182, 2, 1589, 98, 2395, 132, 99, 132, 977, 100, 7, 52, 89, 33, 33, 60, 103, 7342, 5775, 5408, 15, 7532, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 169, 7, 42, 61, 817, 385, 1, 88, 27, 613, 5775, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 70, 78, 70, 14, 15, 88, 39, 1340, 7532, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 70, 78, 70, 18, 96, 186, 24, 139, 290, 281, 3633, 11, 813, 778, 720, 62, 88, 676, 88, 27, 39, 3904, 676, 519, 1545, 584, 27, 1340, 584, 339, 2, 3655, 519, 326, 370, 20, 1966, 519, 13, 613, 243, 27, 1218, 243, 13, 2, 6725, 4464, 350, 13, 7342, 645, 10, 61, 470, 28, 5408, 2, 7532, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 2017, 6, 2383, 3977, 5310, 81, 4, 857, 5, 64, 7423, 1982, 824, 63, 51, 10, 585, 34, 1270, 4, 762, 7, 648, 5, 100, 5, 86, 1025, 11848, 365, 7, 513, 1270, 9, 80, 76, 49, 49, 66, 133, 2, 233, 410, 106, 132, 2130, 132, 7342, 264, 1595, 367, 2, 2395, 4, 815, 7, 961, 7532, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 2, 3977, 5408, 81, 188, 172, 18, 172, 11, 2017, 6, 135, 4, 857, 2172, 1, 1069, 1270, 538, 195, 940, 1, 7342, 397, 5, 127, 183, 4, 2, 11848, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 79, 70243, 605, 3194, 1630, 70]",1830.0,28432176,Phase CDK4/6 Inhibitor Ribociclib LEE011 Pediatric Patients Malignant Rhabdoid Neuroblastoma Solid,0,0.0
PGBD5 promotes site-specific oncogenic mutations in human tumors.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2017-05-15,"Genomic rearrangements are a hallmark of human cancers. Here, we identify the piggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) gene as encoding an active DNA transposase expressed in the majority of childhood solid tumors, including lethal rhabdoid tumors. Using assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing, we found previously undefined genomic rearrangements in human rhabdoid tumors. These rearrangements involved PGBD5-specific signal (PSS) sequences at their breakpoints and recurrently inactivated tumor-suppressor genes. PGBD5 was physically associated with genomic PSS sequences that were also sufficient to mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements in rhabdoid tumor cells. Ectopic expression of PGBD5 in primary immortalized human cells was sufficient to promote cell transformation in vivo. This activity required specific catalytic residues in the PGBD5 transposase domain as well as end-joining DNA repair and induced structural rearrangements with PSS breakpoints. These results define PGBD5 as an oncogenic mutator and provide a plausible mechanism for site-specific DNA rearrangements in childhood and adult solid tumors.",Journal Article,981.0,20.0,Genomic rearrangements hallmark human identify piggyBac transposable element derived 5 PGBD5 encoding active DNA transposase expressed majority childhood solid including lethal rhabdoid assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing previously undefined genomic rearrangements human rhabdoid rearrangements involved PGBD5-specific signal PSS sequences breakpoints recurrently inactivated tumor-suppressor PGBD5 physically associated genomic PSS sequences sufficient mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements rhabdoid Ectopic expression PGBD5 primary immortalized human sufficient promote transformation vivo activity required specific catalytic residues PGBD5 transposase domain end-joining DNA repair induced structural rearrangements PSS breakpoints define PGBD5 oncogenic mutator provide plausible mechanism site-specific DNA rearrangements childhood adult solid,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[572, 2072, 32, 8, 4683, 1, 171, 163, 467, 21, 255, 3, 50380, 41098, 4467, 526, 33, 27608, 145, 22, 2362, 35, 544, 261, 18066, 570, 4, 3, 686, 1, 864, 537, 57, 141, 2266, 57, 75, 7210, 90, 902, 898, 261, 615, 21, 204, 373, 5425, 572, 2072, 4, 171, 57, 46, 2072, 646, 27608, 112, 1235, 14929, 2866, 28, 136, 7843, 2, 8820, 5458, 30, 1245, 214, 27608, 10, 7263, 41, 5, 572, 14929, 2866, 17, 11, 120, 1952, 6, 3367, 27608, 277, 261, 2072, 4, 30, 37, 3647, 55, 1, 27608, 4, 86, 6090, 171, 37, 10, 1952, 6, 1617, 31, 1392, 4, 386, 26, 128, 616, 112, 4784, 6418, 4, 3, 27608, 18066, 1398, 22, 149, 22, 396, 10690, 261, 972, 2, 277, 3281, 2072, 5, 14929, 7843, 46, 99, 1107, 27608, 22, 35, 1302, 24464, 2, 377, 8, 7761, 670, 9, 606, 112, 261, 2072, 4, 864, 2, 780, 537, 57]",1092.0,28504702,PGBD5 promotes site-specific oncogenic human,0,0.0
Cancer Surveillance in Gorlin Syndrome and Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2017-06-01,"Gorlin syndrome and rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS) are autosomal dominant syndromes associated with an increased risk of childhood-onset brain tumors. Individuals with Gorlin syndrome can manifest a wide range of phenotypic abnormalities, with about 5% of family members developing medulloblastoma, usually occurring in the first 3 years of life. Gorlin syndrome is associated with germline mutations in components of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, including Patched1 (<i>PTCH1)</i> and Suppressor of fused (<i>SUFU)</i><i>SUFU</i> mutation carriers appear to have an especially high risk of early-onset medulloblastoma. Surveillance MRI in the first years of life in <i>SUFU</i> mutation carriers is, therefore, recommended. Given the risk of basal cell carcinomas, regular dermatologic examinations and sun protection are also recommended. Rhabdoid tumors (RT) are tumors initially defined by the descriptive ""rhabdoid"" term, implying a phenotypic similarity with rhabdomyoblasts at the microscopic level. RTs usually present before the age of 3 and can arise within the cranium as atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors or extracranially, especially in the kidney, as malignant rhabdoid tumors. However, RTs of both types share germline and somatic mutations in <i>SMARCB1</i> or, more rarely, <i>SMARCA4</i>, each of which encodes a chromatin remodeling family member. <i>SMARCA4</i> mutations are particularly associated with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT). The outcome following a diagnosis of any of these tumors is often poor, and the value of surveillance is unknown. International efforts to determine surveillance protocols are underway, and preliminary recommendations are made for carriers of <i>SMARCB1</i> and <i>SMARCA4</i> mutations. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); e62-e67. ©2017 AACR</i><b>See all articles in the online-only <i>CCR</i> Pediatric Oncology Series.</b>",Journal Article,964.0,32.0,Gorlin syndrome rhabdoid predisposition syndrome RTPS autosomal dominant syndromes associated increased risk childhood-onset brain Individuals Gorlin syndrome manifest wide range phenotypic abnormalities 5 family members developing medulloblastoma usually occurring 3 years life Gorlin syndrome associated germline components Sonic Hedgehog pathway including Patched1 PTCH1 /i Suppressor fused SUFU /i SUFU /i carriers appear especially high risk early-onset medulloblastoma Surveillance MRI years life SUFU /i carriers recommended Given risk basal carcinomas regular dermatologic examinations sun protection recommended Rhabdoid RT initially defined descriptive `` rhabdoid '' term implying phenotypic similarity rhabdomyoblasts microscopic level RTs usually present age 3 arise cranium atypical teratoid/rhabdoid extracranially especially kidney malignant rhabdoid RTs types share germline somatic SMARCB1 /i rarely SMARCA4 /i encodes chromatin remodeling family member SMARCA4 /i particularly associated small carcinoma ovary hypercalcemic type SCCOHT outcome following diagnosis poor value surveillance unknown International efforts determine surveillance protocols underway preliminary recommendations carriers SMARCB1 /i SMARCA4 /i Clin Res 23 12 e62-e67 ©2017 AACR /i b articles online-only CCR /i Pediatric Oncology Series. /b,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[29451, 681, 2, 30, 2863, 681, 36439, 32, 6084, 2156, 2040, 41, 5, 35, 101, 43, 1, 864, 1707, 342, 57, 869, 5, 29451, 681, 122, 7633, 8, 1019, 184, 1, 3290, 1171, 5, 545, 33, 1, 607, 1684, 931, 2714, 2082, 1821, 4, 3, 157, 27, 60, 1, 358, 29451, 681, 16, 41, 5, 1009, 138, 4, 1628, 1, 3, 10025, 4097, 308, 141, 47148, 70, 12222, 70, 2, 1245, 1, 6263, 70, 21753, 70, 70, 21753, 70, 258, 1316, 1322, 6, 47, 35, 1093, 64, 43, 1, 191, 1707, 2714, 617, 704, 4, 3, 157, 60, 1, 358, 4, 70, 21753, 70, 258, 1316, 16, 673, 793, 447, 3, 43, 1, 2135, 31, 826, 3316, 4722, 4209, 2, 5479, 3525, 32, 120, 793, 57, 240, 32, 57, 1625, 395, 20, 3, 3778, 522, 337, 7885, 8, 3290, 6700, 5, 28595, 28, 3, 2984, 301, 18322, 2082, 364, 348, 3, 89, 1, 27, 2, 122, 3043, 262, 3, 37683, 22, 1973, 12478, 15458, 57, 15, 49877, 1093, 4, 3, 22, 393, 57, 137, 18322, 1, 110, 630, 4349, 1009, 2, 1119, 138, 4, 70, 5952, 70, 15, 80, 2416, 70, 12457, 70, 296, 1, 92, 4322, 8, 2287, 4429, 607, 2693, 70, 12457, 70, 138, 32, 823, 41, 5, 302, 31, 134, 1, 3, 3631, 24534, 267, 22913, 3, 228, 366, 8, 147, 1, 500, 1, 46, 57, 16, 629, 334, 2, 3, 549, 1, 617, 16, 860, 944, 1413, 6, 223, 617, 2189, 32, 3948, 2, 1676, 883, 32, 1229, 9, 1316, 1, 70, 5952, 70, 2, 70, 12457, 70, 138, 70, 2459, 12, 1936, 382, 133, 70598, 70599, 3194, 1630, 70, 132, 3764, 62, 2384, 4, 3, 4123, 158, 70, 4992, 70, 815, 413, 988, 132]",1818.0,28620006,Surveillance Gorlin Syndrome Rhabdoid Predisposition Syndrome,5,0.078125
SMARCB1 is required for widespread BAF complex-mediated activation of enhancers and bivalent promoters.,Nature genetics,Nat. Genet.,2017-09-25,"Perturbations to mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF or BAF) complexes contribute to more than 20% of human cancers, with driving roles first identified in malignant rhabdoid tumor, an aggressive pediatric cancer characterized by biallelic inactivation of the core BAF complex subunit SMARCB1 (BAF47). However, the mechanism by which this alteration contributes to tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We find that BAF47 loss destabilizes BAF complexes on chromatin, absent significant changes in complex assembly or integrity. Rescue of BAF47 in BAF47-deficient sarcoma cell lines results in increased genome-wide BAF complex occupancy, facilitating widespread enhancer activation and opposition of Polycomb-mediated repression at bivalent promoters. We demonstrate differential regulation by two distinct mSWI/SNF assemblies, BAF and PBAF complexes, enhancers and promoters, respectively, suggesting that each complex has distinct functions that are perturbed upon BAF47 loss.

Malignant rhabdoid tumors originating within and outside the central nervous system are clinically and molecularly heterogeneous.,Acta neuropathologica,Acta Neuropathol.,2018-02-10,"Multifocal synchronous or metachronous atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) and non-central nervous system malignant rhabdoid tumors (extra-CNS MRTs) are rare cancers. We reviewed the clinical and radiologic characteristics of affected patients seen at our institution. Genotyping and analysis of copy number abnormalities (CNAs) in SMARCB1 were performed in germline and tumor samples. Tumor samples underwent genome-wide DNA methylation and CNA analysis. The median age at diagnosis of 21 patients was 0.6 years. Two-thirds of ATRTs and extra-CNS MRTs were diagnosed synchronously. Although kidney tumors predominated, including two patients with bilateral involvement, at least 30% of cases lacked renal involvement. Histopathologic review confirmed MRTs in all cases and INI1 expression loss in all tumors tested. Fourteen (78%) of 18 patients tested had heterozygous germline SMARCB1 abnormalities. At least one allelic SMARCB1 abnormality was confirmed in 81 and 88% of ATRTs and extra-CNS MRTs, respectively. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of DNA methylation in 27 tumors and comparison with a reference group of 150 ATRTs classified the CNS tumors (n = 14) as sonic hedgehog (64%), tyrosinase (21%), and MYC (14%). The MYC subgroup accounted for 85% of 13 extra-CNS MRTs. Of 16 paired ATRTs and extra-CNS MRTs, the tumors in seven of eight patients showed a different pattern of genome-wide DNA methylation and/or CNAs suggestive of non-clonal origin. CNS and extra-CNS tumors had an identical SMARCB1 amplification (n = 1) or very similar DNA methylation pattern (n = 1) suggestive of clonal origin. All patients died of tumor progression. The clinical and molecular characteristics of multifocal ATRTs and extra-CNS MRTs are heterogeneous with most patients harboring a cancer predisposition.

Pathol.,2018-04-22,"The new paradigm of mutations in chromatin-modifying genes as driver events in the development of cancers has proved challenging to resolve the complex influences over disease phenotypes. In particular, impaired activities of members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex have appeared in an increasing variety of tumors. Mutations in SNF5, a member of this ubiquitously expressed complex, arise in almost all cases of malignant rhabdoid tumor in the absence of additional genetic alterations. Therefore, we studied how activation of additional oncogenic pathways might shift the phenotype of disease driven by SNF5 loss. With the use of a genetically engineered mouse model, we examined the effects of a hypomorphic Vhl<sup>2B</sup> allele on disease phenotype, with a modest up-regulation of the hypoxia response pathway. Snf5<sup>+/-</sup>;Vhl<sup>2B/+</sup> mice did not demonstrate a substantial difference in overall survival or a change in malignant rhabdoid tumor development. However, a high percentage of female mice showed complex hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, a phenotype rarely found in either parental mouse strain.

The Clinical Activity of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in Metastatic Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,Cancer immunology research,Cancer Immunol Res,2018-05-10,"Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have shown activity in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Data on the activity of these agents in patients with non-clear cell RCC (nccRCC) or patients with sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation are limited. In this multicenter analysis, we explored the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with nccRCC or sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation. Baseline and follow-up demographic, clinical, treatment, and radiographic data were collected. The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include time-to-treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), and biomarker correlates. Forty-three patients were included: papillary (<i>n</i> = 14; 33%), chromophobe (<i>n</i> = 10; 23%), unclassified (<i>n</i> = 9; 21%), translocation (<i>n</i> = 3; 7%), and ccRCC with sarcomatoid differentiation (<i>n</i> = 7, 16%). Of those 43 patients, 11 patients (26%) had sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation (<i>n</i> = 7 with ccRCC; <i>n</i> = 4 nccRCC). Overall, 8 patients (19%) objectively responded, including 4 patients (13%) who received PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Responses were observed in patients with ccRCC with sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation (<i>n</i> = 3/7, 43%), translocation RCC (<i>n</i> = 1/3, 33%), and papillary RCC (<i>n</i> = 4/14, 29%). The median TTF was 4.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.8-5.5] and median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 7.4-not reached). No specific genomic alteration was associated with clinical benefit. Modest antitumor activity for PD-1/PD-L1-blocking agents was observed in some patients with nccRCC. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in this heterogeneous patient population. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 6(7); 758-65. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,621.0,12.0,Programmed death 1 PD-1 PD ligand 1 PD-L1 inhibitors shown activity metastatic clear renal carcinoma ccRCC activity agents patients non-clear RCC nccRCC patients sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation limited multicenter explored efficacy PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors patients nccRCC sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation Baseline follow-up demographic clinical treatment radiographic collected primary endpoint objective response rate Secondary endpoints include time-to-treatment failure TTF overall survival OS biomarker correlates Forty-three patients included papillary n /i 14 33 chromophobe n /i 10 23 unclassified n /i 9 21 translocation n /i 3 7 ccRCC sarcomatoid differentiation n /i 7 16 43 patients 11 patients 26 sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation n /i 7 ccRCC n /i 4 nccRCC Overall 8 patients 19 objectively responded including 4 patients 13 received PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy Responses observed patients ccRCC sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation n /i 3/7 43 translocation RCC n /i 1/3 33 papillary RCC n /i 4/14 29 median TTF 4.0 months 95 confidence interval CI 2.8-5.5 median OS 12.9 months 95 CI 7.4-not reached specific genomic alteration associated clinical benefit Modest antitumor activity PD-1/PD-L1-blocking agents observed patients nccRCC prospective studies warranted investigate efficacy PD-1/PD-L1 blockade heterogeneous patient population Immunol Res 6 7 758-65 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1846, 273, 14, 333, 14, 2, 333, 1232, 14, 333, 729, 222, 47, 443, 128, 4, 113, 885, 31, 31, 134, 3090, 74, 23, 3, 128, 1, 46, 183, 4, 7, 5, 220, 885, 31, 796, 10134, 15, 7, 5, 3912, 15458, 910, 32, 383, 4, 26, 1570, 65, 21, 1443, 3, 209, 1, 333, 14, 333, 729, 222, 4, 7, 5, 10134, 15, 3912, 15458, 910, 330, 2, 166, 126, 1540, 38, 24, 2, 1580, 74, 11, 786, 3, 86, 1138, 10, 461, 51, 116, 568, 1387, 643, 98, 6, 24, 496, 4583, 63, 25, 118, 2, 901, 1871, 1213, 169, 7, 11, 159, 1796, 70, 78, 70, 213, 466, 6042, 70, 78, 70, 79, 382, 7096, 70, 78, 70, 83, 239, 2006, 70, 78, 70, 27, 67, 2, 3090, 5, 3912, 910, 70, 78, 70, 67, 245, 1, 135, 601, 7, 175, 7, 432, 42, 3912, 2, 15, 910, 70, 78, 70, 67, 5, 3090, 70, 78, 70, 39, 10134, 63, 66, 7, 326, 8731, 2211, 141, 39, 7, 233, 54, 103, 333, 14, 333, 729, 1411, 253, 11, 164, 4, 7, 5, 3090, 5, 3912, 2, 15, 910, 70, 78, 70, 27, 67, 601, 2006, 796, 70, 78, 70, 14, 27, 466, 2, 1796, 796, 70, 78, 70, 39, 213, 462, 3, 52, 4583, 10, 39, 13, 53, 48, 307, 268, 58, 18, 66, 33, 33, 2, 52, 118, 10, 133, 83, 53, 48, 58, 67, 39, 44, 1300, 77, 112, 572, 2611, 10, 41, 5, 38, 247, 1721, 579, 128, 9, 333, 14, 333, 729, 2521, 183, 10, 164, 4, 476, 7, 5, 10134, 195, 482, 94, 32, 1197, 6, 963, 3, 209, 1, 333, 14, 333, 729, 1189, 4, 26, 1564, 69, 266, 70, 12, 8557, 1936, 49, 67, 13235, 556, 4281, 1630, 70]",1686.0,29748390,Clinical Activity PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors Metastatic Non-Clear Renal Carcinoma,0,0.0

Comprehensive Analysis of Chromatin States in Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Identifies Diverging Roles for SWI/SNF and Polycomb in Gene Regulation.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2018-12-27,"Biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1, encoding a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is the hallmark genetic aberration of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT). Here, we report how loss of SMARCB1 affects the epigenome in these tumors. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) on primary tumors for a series of active and repressive histone marks, we identified the chromatin states differentially represented in ATRTs compared with other brain tumors and non-neoplastic brain.

p53 Is a Master Regulator of Proteostasis in SMARCB1-Deficient Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2019-02-01,"Alterations in chromatin remodeling genes have been increasingly implicated in human oncogenesis. Specifically, the biallelic inactivation of the SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1 results in the emergence of extremely aggressive pediatric malignancies. Here, we developed embryonic mosaic mouse models of malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) that faithfully recapitulate the clinical-pathological features of the human disease. We demonstrated that SMARCB1-deficient malignancies exhibit dramatic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER stress response via a genetically intact MYC-p19<sup>ARF</sup>-p53 axis. As a consequence, these tumors display an exquisite sensitivity to agents inducing proteotoxic stress and inhibition of the autophagic machinery. In conclusion, our findings provide a rationale for drug repositioning trials investigating combinations of agents targeting the UPR and autophagy in SMARCB1-deficient MRTs.",Journal Article,354.0,4.0,Alterations chromatin remodeling increasingly implicated human oncogenesis Specifically biallelic inactivation SWI/SNF subunit SMARCB1 emergence extremely aggressive pediatric malignancies developed embryonic mosaic mouse models malignant rhabdoid MRTs faithfully recapitulate clinical-pathological features human disease demonstrated SMARCB1-deficient malignancies exhibit dramatic activation unfolded response UPR ER stress response genetically intact MYC-p19 sup ARF /sup -p53 axis consequence display exquisite sensitivity agents inducing proteotoxic stress inhibition autophagic machinery findings provide rationale drug repositioning trials investigating combinations agents targeting UPR autophagy SMARCB1-deficient MRTs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[593, 4, 2287, 4429, 214, 47, 85, 1635, 1771, 4, 171, 4503, 1225, 3, 6435, 2297, 1, 3, 4983, 5071, 3350, 5952, 99, 4, 3, 3397, 1, 2938, 571, 815, 441, 467, 21, 276, 5390, 15544, 830, 274, 1, 393, 57, 12654, 17, 17760, 7746, 3, 38, 1301, 404, 1, 3, 171, 34, 21, 264, 17, 5952, 1971, 441, 2239, 3079, 363, 1, 3, 12146, 178, 51, 8468, 2, 516, 1531, 51, 847, 8, 2301, 2964, 1371, 16430, 172, 5509, 172, 624, 2310, 22, 8, 4177, 46, 57, 3640, 35, 15227, 485, 6, 183, 1958, 29554, 1531, 2, 297, 1, 3, 8810, 6415, 4, 1221, 114, 272, 377, 8, 1728, 9, 234, 15327, 143, 3103, 1247, 1, 183, 529, 3, 8468, 2, 2240, 4, 5952, 1971, 12654]",909.0,30753823,p53 Master Regulator Proteostasis SMARCB1-Deficient Malignant Rhabdoid,0,0.0
Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Sellar Tumor in an Adult with a Familial History of a Germline SMARCB1 Mutation: Case Report and Review of the Literature.,World neurosurgery,World Neurosurg,2019-04-17,"Adult sellar atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare diagnosis that has recently been shown to be a clinicopathologically and genetically distinct variant of ATRT occurring almost exclusively in middle-aged women. Although up to one third of pediatric ATRT is caused by a familial syndrome, no previous cases of a familial adult sellar ATRT have been reported. We present the first case report of a familial germline mutation causing adult sellar ATRT and a literature review of 29 previously reported cases of sporadic adult sellar ATRT. A 51-year-old woman with a family history of brain tumors spanning 3 generations presented with visual decline and was diagnosed with an adult sellar ATRT. Genetic studies showed a heterozygous splice-site loss-of-function mutation of the INI1 gene in exon 7. Treatment included endoscopic endonasal biopsy, craniospinal irradiation, and focal tumor boost, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This is the first case report of a familial germline mutation causing adult sellar ATRT.

BRD9 defines a SWI/SNF sub-complex and constitutes a specific vulnerability in malignant rhabdoid tumors.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2019-04-23,"Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) is a recently identified subunit of SWI/SNF(BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes, yet its function is poorly understood. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we show that BRD9 is a specific vulnerability in pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (RTs), which are driven by inactivation of the SMARCB1 subunit of SWI/SNF. We find that BRD9 exists in a unique SWI/SNF sub-complex that lacks SMARCB1, which has been considered a core subunit. While SMARCB1-containing SWI/SNF complexes are bound preferentially at enhancers, we show that BRD9-containing complexes exist at both promoters and enhancers. Mechanistically, we show that SMARCB1 loss causes increased BRD9 incorporation into SWI/SNF thus providing insight into BRD9 vulnerability in RTs. Underlying the dependency, while its bromodomain is dispensable, the DUF3512 domain of BRD9 is essential for SWI/SNF integrity in the absence of SMARCB1. Collectively, our results reveal a BRD9-containing SWI/SNF subcomplex is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant RTs.",Journal Article,273.0,5.0,Bromodomain-containing 9 BRD9 recently identified subunit SWI/SNF BAF chromatin remodeling complexes function poorly understood genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen BRD9 specific vulnerability pediatric malignant rhabdoid RTs driven inactivation SMARCB1 subunit SWI/SNF BRD9 exists unique SWI/SNF sub-complex lacks SMARCB1 considered core subunit SMARCB1-containing SWI/SNF complexes bound preferentially enhancers BRD9-containing complexes exist promoters enhancers Mechanistically SMARCB1 loss causes increased BRD9 incorporation SWI/SNF providing insight BRD9 vulnerability RTs Underlying dependency bromodomain dispensable DUF3512 domain BRD9 essential SWI/SNF integrity absence SMARCB1 Collectively reveal BRD9-containing SWI/SNF subcomplex required survival SMARCB1-mutant RTs,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7904, 1101, 178, 83, 25901, 16, 8, 761, 108, 3350, 1, 4983, 5071, 18686, 2287, 4429, 3817, 1145, 211, 343, 16, 1240, 1784, 467, 75, 8, 898, 1019, 7736, 9071, 2413, 21, 514, 17, 25901, 16, 8, 112, 7665, 4, 815, 393, 57, 18322, 92, 32, 1621, 20, 2297, 1, 3, 5952, 3350, 1, 4983, 5071, 21, 2469, 17, 25901, 2481, 4, 8, 991, 4983, 5071, 551, 840, 17, 6856, 5952, 92, 71, 85, 515, 8, 1793, 3350, 369, 5952, 1101, 4983, 5071, 3817, 32, 2951, 3509, 28, 9139, 21, 514, 17, 25901, 1101, 3817, 1923, 28, 110, 4347, 2, 9139, 4187, 21, 514, 17, 5952, 407, 1626, 101, 25901, 2838, 237, 4983, 5071, 631, 1736, 2670, 237, 25901, 7665, 4, 18322, 1181, 3, 6359, 369, 211, 7904, 16, 15142, 3, 74702, 1398, 1, 25901, 16, 1452, 9, 4983, 5071, 4797, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 5952, 2535, 114, 99, 2396, 8, 25901, 1101, 4983, 5071, 46874, 16, 616, 9, 3, 25, 1, 5952, 620, 18322]",1036.0,31015438,BRD9 defines SWI/SNF sub-complex constitutes specific vulnerability malignant rhabdoid,0,0.0
