Outcome of preventive surgery and screening for breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA mutation carriers.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-03-01,"To prospectively determine the impact of genetic counseling and testing on risk-reduction strategies and cancer incidence in a cohort of individuals at hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Two hundred fifty-one individuals with BRCA mutations were identified at a single comprehensive cancer center from May 1, 1995, through October 31, 2000. Uniform recommendations regarding screening and preventive surgery were provided in the context of genetic counseling. Patients were followed for a mean of 24.8 months (range, 1.6 to 66.0 months) using standardized questionnaires, chart reviews, and contact with primary physicians. Frequency of cancer surveillance by physical examinations and imaging studies increased after genetic counseling and testing. Twenty-one breast, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers were detected after receipt of genetic test results. Among 29 individuals choosing risk-reducing mastectomy after testing, two were found to have occult intraductal breast cancers. Among 90 individuals who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, one early-stage ovarian neoplasm and one early-stage fallopian tube neoplasm were found. Radiographic or tumor marker-based screening detected six breast cancers, five of which were stage 0/I, one early-stage primary peritoneal cancer, and three stage I or II ovarian cancers. Six additional breast cancers were detected by physical examination between radiographic screening intervals; four of these six tumors were stage I. No stage III or stage IV malignancies were detected after genetic testing. This study provides prospective evidence that genetic counseling and testing increased surveillance and led to risk-reducing operations, which resulted in diagnosis of early-stage tumors in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.",Journal Article,6535.0,378.0,To prospectively determine the impact of genetic counseling and testing on risk-reduction strategies and cancer incidence in a cohort of individuals at hereditary risk for and cancer Two hundred fifty-one individuals with BRCA mutations were identified at a single comprehensive cancer center from May 1 1995 through October 31 2000 Uniform recommendations regarding screening and preventive surgery were provided in the context of genetic counseling Patients were followed for a mean of 24.8 months range 1.6 to 66.0 months using standardized questionnaires chart reviews and contact with primary physicians Frequency of cancer surveillance by physical examinations and imaging studies increased after genetic counseling and testing Twenty-one primary peritoneal or tube cancers were detected after receipt of genetic test results Among 29 individuals choosing risk-reducing mastectomy after testing two were found to have occult intraductal cancers Among 90 individuals who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy one early-stage neoplasm and one early-stage tube neoplasm were found Radiographic or tumor marker-based screening detected six cancers five of which were stage 0/I one early-stage primary peritoneal cancer and three stage I or II cancers Six additional cancers were detected by physical examination between radiographic screening intervals four of these six tumors were stage I No stage III or stage IV malignancies were detected after genetic testing This study provides prospective evidence that genetic counseling and testing increased surveillance and led to risk-reducing operations which resulted in diagnosis of early-stage tumors in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 1143, 223, 3, 345, 1, 336, 2011, 2, 471, 23, 43, 628, 422, 2, 12, 287, 4, 8, 180, 1, 869, 28, 2305, 43, 9, 2, 12, 100, 1128, 1461, 104, 869, 5, 1555, 138, 11, 108, 28, 8, 226, 949, 12, 574, 29, 68, 14, 2323, 298, 2551, 456, 1081, 3490, 883, 666, 453, 2, 3494, 152, 11, 1052, 4, 3, 1533, 1, 336, 2011, 7, 11, 370, 9, 8, 313, 1, 259, 66, 53, 184, 14, 49, 6, 700, 13, 53, 75, 1670, 2956, 2937, 2004, 2, 4393, 5, 86, 1261, 675, 1, 12, 617, 20, 900, 4209, 2, 270, 94, 101, 50, 336, 2011, 2, 471, 737, 104, 86, 1639, 15, 2330, 163, 11, 530, 50, 1699, 1, 336, 412, 99, 107, 462, 869, 5065, 43, 1818, 1036, 50, 471, 100, 11, 204, 6, 47, 2879, 4851, 163, 107, 424, 869, 54, 208, 43, 1818, 5690, 3470, 104, 191, 82, 2131, 2, 104, 191, 82, 2330, 2131, 11, 204, 1580, 15, 30, 952, 90, 453, 530, 437, 163, 365, 1, 92, 11, 82, 13, 70, 104, 191, 82, 86, 1639, 12, 2, 169, 82, 70, 15, 215, 163, 437, 402, 163, 11, 530, 20, 900, 1385, 59, 1580, 453, 1582, 294, 1, 46, 437, 57, 11, 82, 70, 77, 82, 316, 15, 82, 478, 441, 11, 530, 50, 336, 471, 26, 45, 777, 482, 241, 17, 336, 2011, 2, 471, 101, 617, 2, 836, 6, 43, 1818, 3867, 92, 627, 4, 147, 1, 191, 82, 57, 4, 7, 5, 766, 2, 1167, 138]",1703.0,"['prospectively', 'determine', 'impact', 'genetic', 'counseling', 'testing', 'risk', 'reduction', 'strategy', 'incidence', 'cohort', 'individual', 'hereditary', 'risk', 'breast', 'ovarian', 'individual', 'brca', 'identified', 'single', 'comprehensive', 'center', 'october', 'uniform', 'recommendation', 'screening', 'preventive', 'surgery', 'provided', 'context', 'genetic', 'counseling', 'patient', 'followed', 'mean', 'month', 'range', 'month', 'standardized', 'questionnaire', 'chart', 'review', 'contact', 'primary', 'physician', 'frequency', 'surveillance', 'physical', 'examination', 'imaging', 'increased', 'genetic', 'counseling', 'testing', 'breast', 'ovarian', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'detected', 'receipt', 'genetic', 'test', 'individual', 'choosing', 'risk', 'reducing', 'mastectomy', 'testing', 'occult', 'intraductal', 'breast', 'individual', 'underwent', 'risk', 'reducing', 'salpingo', 'oophorectomy', 'early', 'stage', 'ovarian', 'neoplasm', 'early', 'stage', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'neoplasm', 'radiographic', 'marker', 'based', 'screening', 'detected', 'breast', 'stage', 'early', 'stage', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'stage', 'ii', 'ovarian', 'additional', 'breast', 'detected', 'physical', 'examination', 'radiographic', 'screening', 'interval', 'stage', 'stage', 'iii', 'stage', 'iv', 'malignancy', 'detected', 'genetic', 'testing', 'provides', 'prospective', 'evidence', 'genetic', 'counseling', 'testing', 'increased', 'surveillance', 'led', 'risk', 'reducing', 'operation', 'resulted', 'diagnosis', 'early', 'stage', 'patient', 'brca', 'brca']",11870168,4,0.023255813953488372
Cancer risk estimates for BRCA1 mutation carriers identified in a risk evaluation program.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2002-09-01,"Increasing numbers of BRCA1 mutation carriers are being identified in cancer risk evaluation programs. However, no estimates of cancer risk specific to a clinic-based population of mutation carriers are available. These data are clinically relevant, because estimates based on families ascertained for linkage studies may overestimate cancer risk in mutation carriers, and population-based series may underestimate it. Wide variation in risk estimates from these disparate ascertainment groups makes counseling in risk evaluation programs difficult. The purpose of this study was to estimate BRCA1-related cancer risks for individuals ascertained in a breast cancer risk evaluation clinic. Cumulative observed and age-adjusted cancer risk estimates were determined by analyzing 483 BRCA1 mutation carriers in 147 families identified in two academic breast and ovarian cancer risk evaluation clinics. Cancer risks were computed from the proportion of individuals diagnosed with cancer during a 10-year age interval from among the total number of individuals alive and cancer-free at the beginning of that interval. Age-of-diagnosis comparisons were made using two-sided Student's t tests. By age 70, female breast cancer risk was 72.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 67.9% to 77.7%) and ovarian cancer risk was 40.7% (95% CI = 35.7% to 45.6%). The risk for a second primary breast cancer by age 70 was 40.5% (95% CI = 34.1% to 47.0%). We also identified an increased risk of cancer of the colon (twofold), pancreas (threefold), stomach (fourfold), and fallopian tube (120-fold) in BRCA1 mutation carriers as compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program population-based estimates. The estimates for breast and ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers is higher than population-based estimates but lower than estimates based on families ascertained for linkage studies.

Phase I escalation of gemcitabine combined with protracted oral etoposide in gynecologic malignancies: A Gynecologic Oncology Group study.,Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2002-11-01,"Although improvements have been made in the management of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, long-term survivors are still uncommon. Gemcitabine and prolonged oral etoposide have shown reproducible single-agent activity in patients with platinum/paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. This, combined with preclinical synergism, prompted the Gynecologic Oncology Group to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination. Eligible patients had recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary papillary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma. All had received prior platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and had adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow function. Oral etoposide was administered at 50 mg/m2 for ten days, with three proposed dose levels for gemcitabine on days 1 and 8: 400, 550 and 700 mg/m2. Cycles were to be repeated every 28 days. Three patients were to enter at each dose level. Patients were enrolled only to dose level 1 as this dose exceeded MTD. Of six patients initially enrolled, one was removed after three days with fever, ascites and decreased albumin believed not to be treatment related. Five patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. One of the first three patients developed dose limiting toxicity (DLT) manifested as grade 4 neutropenia. A second DLT (neutropenic fever and thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding) occurred among the next three patients: therefore, MTD was reached at dose level 1.

Oncol.,2003-03-01,"To improve the survival of women with stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer the Southwest Oncology Group conducted a phase II trial examining two novel treatment strategies: (a) modification of the chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel) based on evidence of response during treatment and (b) ""maintenance therapy,"" with the monthly administration of single agent paclitaxel (maximum 2 years). Individuals with histologically documented stage IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers initially received a maximum of 3 courses of single agent carboplatin (AUC 6), with the decision to administer a subsequent course based on specific response criteria (i.e., declines in serum CA-125 or shrinkage of measurable mass lesions). This was followed by single agent paclitaxel (150 mg/m(2)), delivered every 2 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses, again based on evidence of continued response to the treatment program. Finally, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients received single agent paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) for a maximum of 24 monthly courses. The primary study end point was 2-year overall survival, which was to be compared to the survival of a previously published historical control population [stage IV ovarian cancer patients treated with a ""standard"" cisplatin/paclitaxel regimen (GOG 111; McGuire WP, N Eng E J Med 1996; 334:1)]. This analysis was employed to determine if this novel strategy was worthy of further clinical investigation in a controlled clinical trial. There were 53 patients entered this multicenter study, of whom 50 were evaluable for toxicity and 51 for survival. There were 2 treatment-related deaths. Grades 2 and 3 neutrotoxicity were observed in 18 and 4% of patients, respectively. There were no major treatment-related protocol violations. The overall 2-year survival was 48% (95% CI, 34-62%), compared to 60% for the historical control group. While this trial demonstrated the feasibility of delivering a treatment regimen requiring frequent alternations in therapy based on predetermined changes in objective parameters of response, further exploration of this specific management approach does not appear warranted in stage IV ovarian cancer, based on the survival outcome compared to a reasonably similar historical control population. As this trial demonstrates, the prospective determination of clinical end points in a phase II study (e.g., 2-year survival) that will lead to continued evaluation of a particular investigative strategy in a large-scale randomized trial can be an effective method to reduce the bias and uncertainty often associated with this complex decision process.",Clinical Trial,6170.0,10.0,To improve the

Resection of recurrent ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma involving the liver.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-11-01,"Patients who develop recurrent ovarian of fallopian tube carcinoma involving the liver often have disease refractory to chemotherapy and carry a poor prognosis. The impact of aggressive resection in this patient population is unclear. From 1/1988 to 9/2001, 24 patients with recurrent ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma who underwent complete gross resection or optimal debulking of their hepatic metastases and disease at other sites were identified from prospective databases at a single institution. The median age of patients was 53 years old, and the median interval between primary diagnosis and liver resection was 69 months. All patients had primary resection or cytoreduction and chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment. Subsequent hepatic resections included trisegmentectomy (2), lobectomy (2), segmentectomy (17), and wedge resection (3). Additional resection of disease outside the liver was performed in 18 patients (75%). Twenty-one patients (88%) had removal of all gross disease, and three patients (13%) had optimal tumor debulking to less than 1 cm. Eighteen patients recurred with sites of initial recurrence, including the abdomen and pelvis (14), spine/paraspinal region (2), lung (1), and liver (1).

Fallopian tube and primary peritoneal carcinomas associated with BRCA mutations.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2003-11-01,"The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of BRCA mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish patients with fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) or primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC), to study the clinicopathologic features of these cancers, and to estimate the risks of these cancers in association with a BRCA mutation. A retrospective review at two institutions identified 29 Jewish patients with FTC and 22 Jewish patients with PPC. These patients were genotyped for the three Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA founder mutations (185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1 and 6174delT in BRCA2). Surgical and pathologic information, family history, and survival data were obtained from hospital records. All statistical tests were two sided. Germline BRCA mutations were identified in five of 29 patients with FTC (17%) and nine of 22 patients with PPC (41%). Mutation carriers had a younger mean age at diagnosis than patients without a mutation (60 v 70 years; P =.002). The overall median survival was 148 months for mutation carriers and 41 months for patients without a mutation (P =.04). For BRCA mutation carriers, the lifetime risks of FTC and PPC were 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Substantial proportions of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FTC or PPC are BRCA mutation carriers. Patients with BRCA-associated FTC or PPC are younger at diagnosis and have improved survival compared with patients without a BRCA mutation.

Phase II trial of anastrozole in women with asymptomatic müllerian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2003-12-01,"To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), we conducted a phase II trial in 53 women with asymptomatic recurrent/persistent müllerian cancer. Patients with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma were eligible for enrollment. Eligible patients had an ECOG PS < or = 1 and no clinical indication for immediate systemic chemotherapy. Patients were assigned to measurable (cohort 1) or evaluable disease (cohort 2) cohorts, respectively. Patients were treated with anastrozole 1 mg po daily. Monthly follow-up included interim history, physical exam, and CA-125 with radiologic evaluation every 3 months. Estrogen, progesterone, and Her-2/neu receptor status was also evaluated in archived tumor samples. Fifty-three women with a median age of 63 (range, 46-86) years were enrolled. Twenty-nine women enrolled in cohort 1 and 24 in cohort 2. Included were 43, 7, and 3 women with ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinoma, respectively. All 53 patients were evaluable for treatment toxicity and response. The median time to disease progression was 85 days (85 days for cohort 1 and 82 days for cohort 2). A partial response was documented in a single patient with measurable disease. Forty-two percent of patients had stable disease (measured as time to treatment termination) for >90 days, 15% for >180 days, 7% for >270 days, and 4% for >360 days. One patient remained on anastrozole at 15 months. Toxicity was modest (grade I) and infrequent, with the most common toxicities being fatigue and hot flashes. There were no thrombotic complications. Median time to progression for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors was 72 days as compared to 125 days for those with tumors negative for the estrogen receptor (P = 0.95, log-rank test). The median time to progression in patients with progesterone-positive tumors was 77 days and 91 days for patients with progesterone-negative tumors.

The benefit of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery before planned abdominal exploration in patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2004-08-01,"To analyze the findings and impact on the management of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) before planned abdominal exploration in patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions. We reviewed the charts of all patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions who underwent VATS from 10/01 to 7/03. VATS was performed under double lumen endotracheal anesthesia. A 2-cm chest wall incision was made in the fifth intercostal space on the side of the effusion. The thoracoscope was introduced and biopsies of suspicious lesions were performed through the single incision. After VATS, all patients had a chest tube placed through the incision, and those with malignant effusions underwent talc pleurodesis either intraoperatively or postoperatively. Twelve patients underwent VATS during the study period. Median operative time for VATS was 31 min (range: 20-49 min) with no complications attributable to the procedure.

Two groups of patients were identified for comparison. Group 1, the control group, consisted of 70 consecutive patients who underwent ""standard"" primary cytoreductive surgery before May 2000. Group 2, the study group, was composed of 70 consecutive patients who underwent surgery after January 2001, during which time, a more comprehensive debulking of upper abdominal disease was used, including diaphragm stripping/resection, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, liver resection, resection of porta hepatis tumor, and cholecystectomy. The median age of the entire cohort was 60 years (range, 36-88 years). The majority had stage IIIC disease (86%) and serous histology (76%). Optimal cytoreduction (residual disease </=1 cm) rates were 50% for group 1 and 76% for group 2 (P < 0.01). Patients in group 2 were more likely to have undergone extensive procedure(s) (27% versus 3%; P < 0.001). Operative time and estimated blood loss were greater in group 2 than group 1 (264 versus 174 min, 880 versus 460 cc, respectively; P < 0.001 for both).

"Phase II study of CT-2103 in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2004-11-01,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT-2103, a novel conjugate of paclitaxel and poly-L-glutamic acid, in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. Ninety-nine patients with measurable disease received intravenous CT-2103 at 175 mg/m2 of conjugated paclitaxel over 10 minutes every 3 weeks without routine premedications. Platinum-sensitive (n = 42) and platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant patients (n = 57) were enrolled. Thirty-nine patients (39%) had received one or two prior regimens, and 60 patients (61%) had received between three and 12 regimens. In 99 patients, the median number of cycles was three (range, one to 14 cycles). The response rate (RR) for all patients was 10% (10 of 99 patients), with median time to disease progression (TTP) of 2 months. The RR (partial response) in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients was 14% (six of 42 patients) and 7% (four of 57 patients), respectively. In patients with only one or two prior regimens, the RR in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients was 28% (five of 18 patients) and 10% (two of 21 patients), with a median TTP of 4 and 2 months, respectively. Grade 2 (15 patients) or 3 (15 patients) neuropathy was reported in 30 patients (30%).

Staging was laparoscopic in 20 patients and via laparotomy in 30. There were no differences in mean age and body mass index. There were also no differences in omental specimen size and number of lymph nodes removed. Estimated blood loss and hospital stay were lower for laparoscopy, but operating time was longer.

"Patterns of gene expression in different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer correlate with those in normal fallopian tube, endometrium, and colon.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-09-01,"Epithelial ovarian cancers are thought to arise from flattened epithelial cells that cover the ovarian surface or that line inclusion cysts. During malignant transformation, different histotypes arise that resemble epithelial cells from normal fallopian tube, endometrium, and intestine. This study compares gene expression in serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous ovarian cancers with that in the normal tissues that they resemble. Expression of 63,000 probe sets was measured in 50 ovarian cancers, in 5 pools of normal ovarian epithelial brushings, and in mucosal scrapings from 4 normal fallopian tube, 5 endometrium, and 4 colon specimens. Using rank-sum analysis, genes whose expressions best differentiated the ovarian cancer histotypes and normal ovarian epithelium were used to determine whether a correlation based on gene expression existed between ovarian cancer histotypes and the normal tissues they resemble. When compared with normal ovarian epithelial brushings, alterations in serous tumors correlated with those in normal fallopian tube (P = 0.0042) but not in other normal tissues. Similarly, mucinous cancers correlated with those in normal colonic mucosa (P = 0.0003), and both endometrioid and clear cell histotypes correlated with changes in normal endometrium (P = 0.0172 and 0.0002, respectively). Mucinous cancers displayed the greatest number of alterations in gene expression when compared with normal ovarian epithelial cells. Studies at a molecular level show distinct expression profiles of different histologies of ovarian cancer and support the long-held belief that histotypes of ovarian cancers come to resemble normal fallopian tube, endometrial, and colonic epithelium.

A phase I trial of gemcitabine and topotecan in previously treated ovarian or peritoneal cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2005-09-08,"To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of gemcitabine and topotecan in women with previously treated epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Patients with recurrent or persistent cancer after treatment with a platinum and paclitaxel-containing regimen were eligible for this study. Initial treatment was gemcitabine at a dose of 800 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 and topotecan at a dose of 0.5 mg/m(2) on days 2-5, with cycles repeated every 28 days. Dose escalations were planned first for topotecan (Cohort I, Dose Levels 1-5) then for gemcitabine (Cohort II, Dose Levels 6-9) until the MTD was reached. Ten patients received a total of 29 cycles. When none of the first four patients could complete therapy as prescribed due to toxicity, doses for each drug were reduced by 1 day.

Patients with chemorefractory persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer with measurable disease were enrolled. Capecitabine was administered beginning at 2000 mg/m2/day orally in two divided doses with meals on a 21-day cycle: 14 days of capecitabine followed by a 7-day rest period. One dose escalation or reduction was allowed. Response was assessed after cycle 2 and cycle 4 and every third cycle thereafter. Standard evaluation included two-dimensional measurement of evaluable disease. Standard criteria for response were used. Therapy was discontinued if progression occurred after at least two cycles of therapy. Quality of life and symptoms were assessed. Forty-one patients were enrolled. Ninety-two percent of patients had >2 previous chemotherapy regimens. All patients had platinum- and taxane-resistant disease. Thirty-six patients were evaluable for response. Three patients had a partial response, with a median response duration of five cycles. Twenty-two patients had stable disease for 3 to 11 cycles (median, 6 cycles). Eleven had progressive disease. The only grade 4 toxicity was abdominal pain (n = 2). The most common grade 3 toxicities were fatigue (n = 19), hand-foot syndrome (n = 11), abdominal pain (n = 7), and diarrhea (n = 4).

Incidence and management of pleural effusions after diaphragm peritonectomy or resection for advanced mullerian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-07-03,"Diaphragm peritonectomy or resection is an effective way to cytoreduce diaphragm disease but frequently results in sympathetic pleural effusions. Our objective was to determine the incidence and management of effusions that developed after diaphragm surgery in patients with advanced mullerian cancer. We reviewed the records of all patients with stage IIIC-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer who had diaphragm peritonectomy or resection as part of optimal primary cytoreduction at our institution from 2000-2003. All patients had preoperative and serial postoperative chest X-rays to detect and follow pleural effusions. Factors evaluated included the presence and size of preoperative and postoperative effusions, their laterality, and subsequent need for thoracentesis and/or chest tube placement for symptomatic effusions. Of the 215 patients who had primary cytoreduction during the study period, 59 (27%) underwent diaphragm peritonectomy or resection. In addition to standard cytoreduction, 31 (53%) of these 59 patients had diaphragm surgery alone, while 28 (47%) had diaphragm surgery in combination with other upper abdominal resections. Laterality of diaphragm surgery was as follows: right only, 43 (73%); left only, 2 (3%); and bilateral, 14 (24%). Intraoperative chest tubes were placed in 7 (12%) patients. In the remaining 12 patients with preoperative effusions, postoperative effusions on the same side as the diaphragm surgery increased in 6 patients (50%), and 3 patients (25%) required postoperative thoracentesis or chest tube. In the remaining 40 patients without preoperative effusions, ipsilateral effusions developed in 24 patients (60%), and 5 patients (13%) required postoperative chest tubes. The overall rate of new or increased ipsilateral effusions was 58%; the overall rate of postoperative thoracentesis or chest tube placement was 15%. In 75% of the patients, thoracentesis or chest tubes were placed within 5 days of surgery (median, 3 days; range, 2-24). More than half of patients developed ipsilateral pleural effusions after diaphragm peritonectomy for cytoreduction. Most were managed conservatively without requiring a chest tube or thoracentesis.

Clinical behavior of stage II-IV low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2006-08-01,"To analyze the clinical behavior of patients with stage II-IV low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary seen at our institution who underwent primary surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with stage II-IV low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary from 1978 to 2003 were identified using existing databases. Clinicopathologic information was obtained from medical records. Progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. The log-rank test was used to compare differences between survival curves. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. We identified 112 eligible patients. Median age was 43 years.; 90% had stage III disease. Preoperative serum CA 125 was elevated in 86% of patients. The most common sites of extraovarian disease were omentum, fallopian tubes, pelvic peritoneum, and uterus. Response rate to platinum-based chemotherapy in 10 evaluable patients (15% of patients with gross residual disease) was 80%, and 42 patients underwent second-look surgery: microscopically negative findings, 2 (5%); microscopically positive disease, 13 (33%); macroscopically positive disease, 24 (62%); and insufficient information, 3 (7%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 19.5 and 81.8 months. Persistent disease after primary chemotherapy was the only factor associated with shorter overall survival time (hazard ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 2.00-5.97, P<.001).

Prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy compared with surveillance in women with BRCA mutations.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2006-09-01,"The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical factors associated with choosing prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) over surveillance in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Between 1996 and 2005, 139 women who tested positive for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified. Thirty-three women were excluded due to a personal history of ovarian or fallopian tube cancer before genetic testing, resulting in 106 women for the final analysis. The characteristics of women who underwent prophylactic BSO were compared with those choosing surveillance. Sixty-five of the BRCA mutation carriers (61%) underwent prophylactic BSO. Median age at BSO was 45.6 years. Median time from disclosure of genetic test results to surgery was 4.6 months. Eighty-five percent of women who underwent prophylactic BSO were parous compared with 66% of women who chose surveillance (P = .03). A previous diagnosis of breast cancer was noted in 72% of women who underwent prophylactic BSO compared with 46% of women undergoing surveillance (P < .01). Fifty-two women (80%) had hysterectomy performed at the time of BSO. Two women had incidental ovarian cancer diagnosed at time of surgery.

Patients were randomized to receive abagovomab at 2.0 versus 0.2 mg and i.m. versus s.c. for four immunizations every 2 weeks and then monthly for two additional immunizations. Planned evaluation included interval physical examinations and laboratory assessments with immune assessment, including HLA typing, human anti-mouse antibody, ELISA, and enzyme-linked immunospot. Patients were required to remain on study until week 10 (the first post-baseline Ab3 determination) to be considered for immunologic assessment. The primary end points were safety and immunogenicity primarily determined by Ab3 response. Forty-two patients received at least one vaccination and were eligible for safety analysis. Thirty-three patients were available for Ab3 analysis (removed for progression of disease, 6; withdrawal of consent, 2; unrelated adverse event, 1).

The impact of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in patients with suspected advanced ovarian malignancies and pleural effusions.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2006-12-05,"We previously reported our initial experience of patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions who underwent video-assessed thoracic surgery (VATS) before planned abdominal exploration. The objective of this study was to report the surgical findings and management of patients who underwent VATS in an update of our experience. We performed a retrospective review of all patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions who underwent VATS for assessment of extent of intrathoracic disease at our institution between 6/01 and 8/05. Twenty-three patients with a median age of 61 years (range, 36-79) were identified. VATS was performed for right-sided effusions in 17 patients (74%), and a median of 1350 ml (400-3700 ml) of pleural fluid was drained. VATS demonstrated macroscopic disease in 15 (65%) patients, with nodules >1 cm in 11/15 (73%), and nodules <1 cm in 4/15 (27%). Macroscopic intrathoracic disease was found in 4/10 (40%) patients with negative cytology. Intrathoracic cytoreduction was performed in 3/11 patients (27%) with intrathoracic disease >1 cm. After VATS, 12/23 patients (52%) underwent primary surgical management, with cytoreduction to < or =1 cm achieved in 11/12 patients (92%). The other eleven patients received primary chemotherapy after undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy alone (4/11) or no further abdominal exploration (7/11). Nine of these patients proceeded to interval cytoreduction, while 2 had pathology demonstrating upper gastrointestinal and lymphoma primaries at the time of VATS. Final diagnosis of primary site of disease included: ovary, 14 (61%); endometrial, 2 (9%); dual ovarian/endometrial primaries, 1 (4%); fallopian tube, 1 (4%); primary peritoneal, 1 (4%); other, 4 (17%). Overall, findings at VATS altered primary surgical management in 11/23 (48%) patients. Sixty-five percent of patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer and moderate to large pleural effusions had gross intrathoracic disease identified at VATS, with the majority (11/15, 73%) having disease >1 cm in diameter.

Clinicopathologic features of rhabdomyosarcoma of gynecologic origin in adults.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2007-03-01,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue tumor found in children. Up to 20% of RMS tumors in children originate in the genital tract making this the second most common site. RMS of gynecologic origin in adults is much less common. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of RMS of the adult female genital tract. We reviewed the histologic slides of women 16 years of age and older and included them in our study if they contained the classic histologic features of RMS as described by the 2002 World Health Organization classification of tumors. Rhabdomyoblastic components present in other established malignancies were not studied. We identified 15 patients, with a median age of 48 years (range, 16 to 69). Eleven (73%) of the tumors were of embryonal histology (cervix, 8; uterus, 2; and ovary, 1). Of the remaining 4 tumors, 2 were of alveolar (vulva) and 2 of pleomorphic (uterus, 1; fallopian tube, 1) histologic subtype. The majority (79%) of these patients presented with locoregional disease and had surgery as their primary intervention (73%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival was 9 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 1-24] and 21 months (95% CI, 14-28), respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival was only 29%. There was a significant difference in PFS between cases of embryonal compared to cases with nonembryonal histology (19 vs. 3 mo, respectively) (P=0.04). Adult RMS of gynecologic origin presents with locoregional disease and most are morphologically similar to pediatric RMS; however, adult RMS behaves more aggressively, with worse overall survival. It is unclear whether these divergent outcomes are the result of differences in clinical management or because these tumors are biologically distinct.",Journal Article,4709.0,59.0,RMS is the most common soft tissue tumor found in children Up to 20 of RMS tumors in children originate in the genital tract making this the second most common site RMS of gynecologic origin in adults is much less common The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and pathologic features of RMS of the adult female genital tract We reviewed the histologic slides of women 16 years of age and older and included them in our study if they contained the classic histologic features of RMS as described by the 2002 World Health Organization classification of tumors Rhabdomyoblastic components present in other established malignancies were not studied We identified 15 patients with a median age of 48 years range 16 to 69 Eleven 73 of the tumors were of embryonal histology cervix 8 2 and ovary 1 Of the remaining 4 tumors 2 were of alveolar vulva and 2 of pleomorphic 1 tube 1 histologic subtype The majority 79 of these patients presented with locoregional disease and had surgery as their primary intervention 73 The median progression-free survival PFS and disease-specific survival was 9 months 95 confidence interval CI 1-24 and 21 months 95 CI 14-28 respectively The 5-year disease-specific survival was only 29 There was a significant difference in PFS between cases of embryonal compared to cases with nonembryonal histology 19 vs. 3 mo respectively P=0.04 Adult RMS of gynecologic origin presents with locoregional disease and most are morphologically similar to pediatric RMS however adult RMS behaves more aggressively with worse overall survival It is unclear whether these divergent outcomes are the result of differences in clinical management or because these tumors are biologically distinct,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3413, 16, 3, 96, 186, 1214, 246, 30, 204, 4, 541, 126, 6, 179, 1, 3413, 57, 4, 541, 8838, 4, 3, 8226, 1696, 1079, 26, 3, 419, 96, 186, 606, 3413, 1, 1512, 1938, 4, 857, 16, 1802, 299, 186, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 897, 3, 38, 2, 510, 404, 1, 3413, 1, 3, 780, 1061, 8226, 1696, 21, 446, 3, 884, 3830, 1, 117, 245, 60, 1, 89, 2, 434, 2, 159, 1370, 4, 114, 45, 492, 491, 3070, 3, 3168, 884, 404, 1, 3413, 22, 1027, 20, 3, 1544, 1956, 341, 2533, 947, 1, 57, 37158, 1628, 364, 4, 127, 635, 441, 11, 44, 656, 21, 108, 167, 7, 5, 8, 52, 89, 1, 576, 60, 184, 245, 6, 790, 2627, 803, 1, 3, 57, 11, 1, 5239, 784, 3629, 66, 18, 2, 3631, 14, 1, 3, 1844, 39, 57, 18, 11, 1, 5641, 9263, 2, 18, 1, 4581, 14, 2330, 14, 884, 875, 3, 686, 842, 1, 46, 7, 917, 5, 1325, 34, 2, 42, 152, 22, 136, 86, 788, 803, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 2, 34, 112, 25, 10, 83, 53, 48, 307, 268, 58, 14, 259, 2, 239, 53, 48, 58, 213, 339, 106, 3, 33, 111, 34, 112, 25, 10, 158, 462, 125, 10, 8, 93, 523, 4, 300, 59, 140, 1, 5239, 72, 6, 140, 5, 56097, 784, 326, 105, 27, 2035, 106, 19, 13, 755, 780, 3413, 1, 1512, 1938, 2740, 5, 1325, 34, 2, 96, 32, 6204, 288, 6, 815, 3413, 137, 780, 3413, 16771, 80, 8503, 5, 639, 63, 25, 192, 16, 1200, 317, 46, 8332, 123, 32, 3, 757, 1, 362, 4, 38, 284, 15, 408, 46, 57, 32, 2665, 834]",1718.0,"['rms', 'common', 'soft', 'tissue', 'child', 'rms', 'child', 'originate', 'genital', 'tract', 'making', 'second', 'common', 'site', 'rms', 'gynecologic', 'origin', 'adult', 'le', 'common', 'purpose', 'wa', 'clinical', 'pathologic', 'feature', 'rms', 'adult', 'female', 'genital', 'tract', 'reviewed', 'histologic', 'slide', 'woman', 'year', 'age', 'older', 'included', 'contained', 'classic', 'histologic', 'feature', 'rms', 'described', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'classification', 'component', 'present', 'established', 'malignancy', 'studied', 'identified', 'patient', 'median', 'age', 'year', 'range', 'embryonal', 'histology', 'cervix', 'uterus', 'ovary', 'remaining', 'alveolar', 'vulva', 'pleomorphic', 'uterus', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'histologic', 'subtype', 'majority', 'patient', 'presented', 'locoregional', 'disease', 'surgery', 'primary', 'intervention', 'median', 'progression', 'free', 'survival', 'pfs', 'disease', 'specific', 'survival', 'wa', 'month', 'confidence', 'interval', 'ci', 'month', 'ci', 'respectively', 'year', 'disease', 'specific', 'survival', 'wa', 'wa', 'significant', 'difference', 'pfs', 'case', 'embryonal', 'compared', 'case', 'nonembryonal', 'histology', 'mo', 'respectively', 'adult', 'rms', 'gynecologic', 'origin', 'present', 'locoregional', 'disease', 'morphologically', 'similar', 'pediatric', 'rms', 'adult', 'rms', 'behaves', 'aggressively', 'worse', 'overall', 'survival', 'unclear', 'divergent', 'outcome', 'difference', 'clinical', 'management', 'biologically', 'distinct']",17325479,12,0.06976744186046512
Long-term survivors using intraoperative radiotherapy for recurrent gynecologic malignancies.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2007-06-08,"To analyze the outcomes of therapy and identify prognostic factors for patients treated with surgery followed by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for gynecologic malignancies at a single institution. We performed a retrospective review of 36 consecutive patients treated with IORT to 44 sites with mean follow-up of 50 months. The primary site was the cervix in 47%, endometrium in 31%, vulva in 14%, vagina in 6%, and fallopian tubes in 3%. Previous RT had failed in 72% of patients, and 89% had recurrent disease. Of 38 IORT sessions, 84% included maximal cytoreductive surgery, including 18% exenterations. The mean age was 52 years (range, 30-74), mean tumor size was 5 cm (range, 0.5-12), previous disease-free interval was 32 months (range, 0-177), and mean IORT dose was 1,152 cGy (range, 600-1,750). RT and systemic therapy after IORT were given to 53% and 24% of the cohort, respectively. The outcomes measured were locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and treatment-related complications. The Kaplan-Meier 5-year LRC, DMFS, and DSS probability for the whole group was 44%, 51%, and 47%, respectively. For cervical cancer patients, the Kaplan-Meier 5-year LRC, DMFS, and DSS estimate was 45%, 60%, and 46%, respectively. The prognostic factors found on multivariate analysis (p <or= 0.05) were the disease-free interval for LRC, tumor size for DMFS, and cervical primary, previous surgery, and locoregional relapse for DSS.

"Effect of perioperative venous thromboembolism on survival in ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-07-05,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects 15% of cancer patients and is the second leading cause of death in hospitalized cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to describe the overall survival of patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers treated for VTE within 30 days of initial surgery. We reviewed the medical records of all patients who developed VTE within 30 days of primary surgery for stage I-IV epithelial ovarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer at our institution from 1/99 to 4/05. Standard statistical tests were used. Fifty-seven (10%) of 559 patients developed VTE within 30 days of initial surgery. There were no deaths from VTE within 30 days of surgery. With a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.11-7.3 years), the median overall survival for the entire cohort was 5.9 years (95% CI, 4.6-NR). The proportion of advanced-stage (III-IV) patients within the VTE group compared to the group with no VTE was higher (90% versus 72%; P=0.0078), as was the proportion of patients with ascites compared to those with none (74% versus 54%; P=0.0045), and the proportion of patients with residual disease >1 cm compared to those with <or=1 cm (37% versus 19%; P=0.0021). On multivariate analysis, advanced stage (P<0.0001), the presence of ascites (P=0.0210), and residual disease>1 cm (P<0.0001) were significant predictors of poorer overall survival. VTE within 30 days of surgery was not found to be independently associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.71-1.7); P=0.65).

Phase III randomized trial of intravenous cisplatin plus a 24- or 96-hour infusion of paclitaxel in epithelial ovarian cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-10-01,"This study was undertaken to assess if prolonged paclitaxel administration in combination with cisplatin improves overall survival (OS) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Eligible patients with suboptimal stage III or IV EOC, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer were randomly allocated to receive six cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and either paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 during 24 hours (arm 1) or paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 during 96 hours (arm 2). Planned accrual was 324 patients; 293 were enrolled before the study was closed as a result of a scheduled interim futility analysis. There were 13 ineligible patients; thus, 140 patients in each arm were assessable. In arm 1, 80% of patients completed all six cycles compared with 83% of patients in arm 2. Grade 4 granulocytopenia was more common in arm 1 (79% v 54%; P < .001) whereas grade 3 or worse anemia was more severe in arm 2 (6% v 18%; P < .003). The median progression-free survival was 1.03 years for arm 1 versus 1.05 years for arm 2. The median OS was 2.49 and 2.54 years for arms 1 and 2, respectively. There have been 237 reported deaths. The relative death rate was approximately 12% greater in arm 2 (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.860 to 1.45). Patients with advanced EOC have a relatively poor prognosis. The results of treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel are not significantly improved by prolonging the paclitaxel infusion from 24 to 96 hours.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",4495.0,46.0,This study was undertaken to assess if prolonged paclitaxel administration in combination with cisplatin improves overall survival OS in epithelial cancer EOC Eligible patients with suboptimal stage III or IV EOC tube or primary peritoneal cancer were randomly allocated to receive six cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and either paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 during 24 hours arm 1 or paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 during 96 hours arm 2 Planned accrual was 324 patients 293 were enrolled before the study was closed as a result of a scheduled interim futility analysis There were 13 ineligible patients thus 140 patients in each arm were assessable In arm 1 80 of patients completed all six cycles compared with 83 of patients in arm 2 Grade 4 granulocytopenia was more common in arm 1 79 v 54 P .001 whereas grade 3 or worse anemia was more severe in arm 2 6 v 18 P .003 The median progression-free survival was 1.03 years for arm 1 versus 1.05 years for arm 2 The median OS was 2.49 and 2.54 years for arms 1 and 2 respectively There have been 237 reported deaths The relative death rate was approximately 12 greater in arm 2 hazard ratio 1.12 95 CI 0.860 to 1.45 Patients with advanced EOC have a relatively poor prognosis The results of treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel are not significantly improved by prolonging the paclitaxel infusion from 24 to 96 hours,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 10, 2789, 6, 423, 492, 1069, 490, 634, 4, 150, 5, 540, 1804, 63, 25, 118, 4, 701, 12, 2249, 625, 7, 5, 3291, 82, 316, 15, 478, 2249, 2330, 15, 86, 1639, 12, 11, 1108, 6682, 6, 560, 437, 410, 1, 540, 481, 81, 821, 2, 361, 490, 3978, 81, 821, 190, 259, 1459, 475, 14, 15, 490, 2031, 81, 821, 190, 921, 1459, 475, 18, 1465, 2262, 10, 8393, 7, 7541, 11, 346, 348, 3, 45, 10, 3745, 22, 8, 757, 1, 8, 4394, 2914, 7566, 65, 125, 11, 233, 3773, 7, 631, 3304, 7, 4, 296, 475, 11, 3120, 4, 475, 14, 493, 1, 7, 781, 62, 437, 410, 72, 5, 852, 1, 7, 4, 475, 18, 88, 39, 10552, 10, 80, 186, 4, 475, 14, 842, 603, 667, 19, 144, 547, 88, 27, 15, 639, 1545, 10, 80, 905, 4, 475, 18, 49, 603, 203, 19, 1421, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 10, 14, 680, 60, 9, 475, 14, 185, 14, 474, 60, 9, 475, 18, 3, 52, 118, 10, 18, 739, 2, 18, 667, 60, 9, 1335, 14, 2, 18, 106, 125, 47, 85, 7296, 210, 1043, 3, 580, 273, 116, 10, 705, 133, 378, 4, 475, 18, 360, 197, 14, 133, 48, 58, 13, 14857, 6, 14, 512, 7, 5, 131, 2249, 47, 8, 1352, 334, 356, 3, 99, 1, 24, 5, 540, 2, 490, 32, 44, 97, 231, 20, 5559, 3, 490, 904, 29, 259, 6, 921, 1459]",1347.0,"['wa', 'undertaken', 'ass', 'prolonged', 'paclitaxel', 'administration', 'combination', 'cisplatin', 'improves', 'overall', 'survival', 'epithelial', 'ovarian', 'eoc', 'eligible', 'patient', 'suboptimal', 'stage', 'iii', 'iv', 'eoc', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'randomly', 'allocated', 'receive', 'cycle', 'cisplatin', 'mg', 'paclitaxel', 'mg', 'hour', 'arm', 'paclitaxel', 'mg', 'hour', 'arm', 'planned', 'accrual', 'wa', 'patient', 'enrolled', 'wa', 'closed', 'scheduled', 'interim', 'futility', 'ineligible', 'patient', 'patient', 'arm', 'assessable', 'arm', 'patient', 'completed', 'cycle', 'compared', 'patient', 'arm', 'grade', 'wa', 'common', 'arm', 'grade', 'worse', 'anemia', 'wa', 'severe', 'arm', 'median', 'progression', 'free', 'survival', 'wa', 'year', 'arm', 'versus', 'year', 'arm', 'median', 'wa', 'year', 'arm', 'respectively', 'reported', 'death', 'relative', 'death', 'rate', 'wa', 'approximately', 'greater', 'arm', 'hazard', 'ratio', 'ci', 'patient', 'advanced', 'eoc', 'relatively', 'poor', 'prognosis', 'treatment', 'cisplatin', 'paclitaxel', 'significantly', 'improved', 'prolonging', 'paclitaxel', 'infusion', 'hour']",17906207,22,0.12790697674418605
"The impact of bulky upper abdominal disease cephalad to the greater omentum on surgical outcome for stage IIIC epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-11-13,"To analyze the impact of bulky upper abdominal disease (UAD) cephalad to the greater omentum on surgical outcomes for patients with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal carcinoma. All patients with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal carcinoma who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery at our institution from 1989 to 2005 were eligible for the study. UAD cephalad to the greater omentum was defined as cancerous lesions involving the diaphragm, liver, porta hepatis, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and lesser sac. The study group was divided into three groups based on the presence and size of UAD cephalad to the greater omentum at the beginning of surgery-group 1, no disease; group 2, < or = 1 cm disease; and group 3, bulky disease > 1 cm. These three groups were further divided into two subsets based on the routine use of extensive upper abdominal surgery after January 1, 2001. Standard statistical analyses were utilized. We identified 490 patients who met study inclusion criteria. Their median age was 61 years (range, 25-88). UAD status was recorded in 474 patients as follows: group 1 (no UAD), 116 (24%); group 2 (< or = 1 cm UAD), 161 (34%); and group 3 (bulky UAD > 1 cm), 197 (42%). Bulky UAD was associated with ascites volume (P<0.001). Among the patients with ascites volumes > 500 ml, 54% had bulky UAD cephalad to the greater omentum, 37% had minimal UAD, and 9% had no evidence of UAD. Optimal surgical outcome (< or = 1 cm residual disease) was achieved in 81%, 63%, and 39% of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P<0.001). A significant increase in optimal cytoreduction was observed after 2001 (40% before 2001 vs. 78% after 2001; P<0.001). This effect was more pronounced in patients with bulky UAD (11%, before 2001 vs. 70% after 2001) than in patients with no or minimal UAD (P<0.001). The upper abdomen cephalad to the greater omentum is frequently involved in patients with stage IIIC ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma. This disease site is significantly associated with large-volume ascites and suboptimal cytoreduction. Over the course of 17 years, however, the significant improvement in optimal cytoreduction rates has been most apparent in patients with bulky UAD. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive training, preparation, and referral when appropriate to centers that specialize in the surgical management of patients with advanced ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinoma.",Journal Article,4452.0,85.0,To analyze the impact of bulky upper abdominal disease UAD cephalad to the greater omentum on surgical outcomes for patients with stage

"Serous fallopian tube carcinoma: a retrospective, multi-institutional case-control comparison to serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2007-11-07,"Primary carcinoma of the fallopian tube (PCFT) is a rare malignancy comprising 1% of genital tract cancers. We sought to compare survival trends between PCFT and ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients (pts) in a matched, case-control comparison. Patients with PCFT were identified from five academic centers. Two OC controls were identified for each PCFT pt based on age, stage, and residual disease. All pts were surgically staged and treated with platinum based chemotherapy (CT) if indicated. PFS and OS were then compared with Kaplan-Meier analysis. 96 PCFT cases and 189 OC controls were identified. 50 early stage PCFT were matched with 97 OC pts. The most common CT regimen was carboplatinum and paclitaxel in 84 and 86% respectively. Median follow-up was 57 and 42 months for the PCFT and OC groups and 5-year overall survival (OS) differed at 95% and 76% (p=0.02). 46 Stage III/IV PCFT pts were matched with 92 OC controls. 88.5% were optimally debulked. Median follow-up was 33 and 35 months for PCFT and OC pts and 3-year overall survival was 59% for both groups. This is the first study to compare outcomes for PCFT and OC in a matched, case-control comparison. Our study demonstrates that, for advanced stage PCFT, a similar survival outcome is obtained compared to OC patients.

Participants received 5 class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted synthetic peptides derived from multiple ovarian cancer-associated proteins plus a class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted synthetic helper peptide derived from tetanus toxoid protein. The vaccines were administered with granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant over a 7-week period. All vaccine-related toxicities were grade 1 to 2, the most common being injection site reaction (grade 2, 100%), fatigue (grade 1, 78%), and headache (grade 1, 67%). Lymphocytes from the peripheral blood and a node draining a secondary vaccine site (sentinel immunized node) were harvested during the course of vaccination and T-cell responses to the peptides were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. CD8 T-cell responses were detected in 1 participant ex vivo and in 8 of 9 participants (89%) after in vitro stimulation. All 4 HLA-A2 and HLA-A3-restricted peptides were immunogenic. This includes 2 peptides, folate binding protein (FBP191-199) and Her-2/neu754-762, which had not previously been evaluated in vaccines in humans. Responding T cells required over 200 nM for half-maximal reactivity.

"Efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus erlotinib for patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer: a trial of the Chicago, PMH, and California Phase II Consortia.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2008-04-18,"The objectives of this phase II trial were to assess the activity and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. This was a single arm, multicenter phase II trial with overall objective response as the primary endpoint. Eligible patients had two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or refractory disease and no prior anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents. Bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg, was administered intravenously every 21 days and erlotinib, 150 mg orally, was given daily. Between July and October 2005, 13 patients were enrolled. There were two major objective responses, one complete response of 16+ month duration and one partial response of 11 month duration, for a response rate of 15% (95% CI 1.9% to 45.4%). Seven patients had a best response of stable disease. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities included anemia (n=1), nausea (n=2), vomiting (n=1), hypertension (n=1), and diarrhea (n=2). One patient with an ileostomy was removed from the study secondary to grade 3 diarrhea. Two patients had fatal gastrointestinal perforations. There was no strong suggestion that this combination was superior to single agent bevacizumab, and the rate of gastrointestinal perforation was of concern. The study was therefore stopped. Identification of risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation will be of importance for the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of ovarian cancer.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4295.0,124.0,The objectives of this phase II trial were to assess the activity and tolerability of the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib in patients with recurrent primary peritoneal or tube cancer This was a single arm multicenter phase II trial with overall objective response as the primary endpoint Eligible patients had two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or refractory disease and no prior anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously every 21 days and erlotinib 150 mg orally was given daily Between July and October 2005 13 patients were enrolled There were two major objective responses one complete response of 16+ month duration and one partial response of 11 month duration for a response rate of 15 95 CI 1.9 to 45.4 Seven patients had a best response of stable disease The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities included anemia n=1 nausea n=2 vomiting n=1 hypertension n=1 and diarrhea n=2 One patient with an ileostomy was removed from the study secondary to grade 3 diarrhea Two patients had fatal perforations There was no strong suggestion that this combination was superior to single agent bevacizumab and the rate of perforation was of concern The study was therefore stopped Identification of risk factors for perforation will be of importance for the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of cancer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 2409, 1, 26, 124, 215, 160, 11, 6, 423, 3, 128, 2, 1543, 1, 3, 150, 1, 599, 2, 962, 4, 7, 5, 387, 86, 1639, 15, 2330, 12, 26, 10, 8, 226, 475, 1570, 124, 215, 160, 5, 63, 461, 51, 22, 3, 86, 1138, 625, 7, 42, 100, 15, 1497, 324, 56, 472, 9, 387, 15, 430, 34, 2, 77, 324, 312, 618, 15, 312, 227, 183, 599, 167, 81, 503, 10, 468, 1672, 454, 239, 162, 2, 962, 1577, 81, 1428, 10, 447, 391, 59, 2066, 2, 2551, 1242, 233, 7, 11, 346, 125, 11, 100, 458, 461, 253, 104, 236, 51, 1, 245, 811, 654, 2, 104, 450, 51, 1, 175, 811, 654, 9, 8, 51, 116, 1, 167, 48, 58, 14, 83, 6, 512, 39, 648, 7, 42, 8, 824, 51, 1, 585, 34, 3, 96, 186, 88, 27, 15, 39, 385, 159, 1545, 78, 14, 1218, 78, 18, 1966, 78, 14, 1824, 78, 14, 2, 1172, 78, 18, 104, 69, 5, 35, 12879, 10, 2264, 29, 3, 45, 568, 6, 88, 27, 1172, 100, 7, 42, 3034, 13041, 125, 10, 77, 1082, 8634, 17, 26, 150, 10, 1123, 6, 226, 420, 599, 2, 3, 116, 1, 4854, 10, 1, 2893, 3, 45, 10, 673, 4403, 911, 1, 43, 130, 9, 4854, 303, 40, 1, 1187, 9, 3, 119, 1, 599, 4, 3, 24, 1, 12]",1365.0,"['objective', 'phase', 'ii', 'trial', 'ass', 'activity', 'tolerability', 'combination', 'bevacizumab', 'erlotinib', 'patient', 'recurrent', 'ovarian', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'wa', 'single', 'arm', 'multicenter', 'phase', 'ii', 'trial', 'overall', 'objective', 'response', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'eligible', 'patient', 'fewer', 'prior', 'chemotherapy', 'regimen', 'recurrent', 'refractory', 'disease', 'prior', 'anti', 'vegf', 'anti', 'egfr', 'agent', 'bevacizumab', 'mg', 'wa', 'administered', 'intravenously', 'day', 'erlotinib', 'mg', 'orally', 'wa', 'given', 'daily', 'july', 'october', 'patient', 'enrolled', 'major', 'objective', 'response', 'complete', 'response', 'month', 'duration', 'partial', 'response', 'month', 'duration', 'response', 'rate', 'ci', 'seven', 'patient', 'best', 'response', 'stable', 'disease', 'common', 'grade', 'toxicity', 'included', 'anemia', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'hypertension', 'diarrhea', 'patient', 'ileostomy', 'wa', 'removed', 'secondary', 'grade', 'diarrhea', 'patient', 'fatal', 'perforation', 'wa', 'strong', 'suggestion', 'combination', 'wa', 'superior', 'single', 'agent', 'bevacizumab', 'rate', 'perforation', 'wa', 'concern', 'wa', 'stopped', 'identification', 'risk', 'factor', 'perforation', 'importance', 'use', 'bevacizumab', 'treatment', 'ovarian']",18423560,20,0.11627906976744186
The multifunctional protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is both regulated and controls colony-stimulating factor-1 messenger RNA stability in ovarian cancer.,Molecular cancer research : MCR,Mol. Cancer Res.,2008-08-01,"Although glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase's (GAPDH) predilection for AU-rich elements has long been known, the expected connection between GAPDH and control of mRNA stability has never been made. Recently, we described GAPDH binding the AU-rich terminal 144 nt of the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) 3' untranslated region (UTR), which we showed to be an mRNA decay element in ovarian cancer cells. CSF-1 is strongly correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. We investigated the functional significance of GAPDH's association with CSF-1 mRNA and found that GAPDH small interfering RNA reduces both CSF-1 mRNA and protein levels by destabilizing CSF-1 mRNA. CSF-1 mRNA half-lives were decreased by 50% in the presence of GAPDH small interfering RNA. RNA footprinting analysis of the 144 nt CSF-1 sequence revealed that GAPDH associates with a large AU-rich-containing region. The effects of binding of GAPDH protein or ovarian extracts to mutations of the AU-rich regions within the footprint were consistent with this finding. In a tissue array containing 256 ovarian and fallopian tube cancer specimens, we found that GAPDH was regulated in these cancers, with almost 50% of specimens having no GAPDH staining. Furthermore, we found that low GAPDH staining was associated with a low CSF-1 score (P = 0.008). In summary, GAPDH, a multifunctional protein, now adds regulation of mRNA stability to its repertoire. We are the first to evaluate the clinical role of GAPDH protein in cancer. In ovarian cancers, we show that GAPDH expression is regulated, and we now recognize that one of the many functions of GAPDH is to promote mRNA stability of CSF-1, an important cytokine in tumor progression.",Journal Article,4190.0,74.0,Although glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 's GAPDH predilection for AU-rich elements has long been known the expected connection between GAPDH and control of mRNA stability has never been made Recently we described GAPDH binding the AU-rich terminal 144 nt of the colony-stimulating factor-1 CSF-1 3 untranslated region UTR which we showed to be an mRNA decay element in cancer cells CSF-1 is strongly correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with cancer We investigated the functional significance of GAPDH 's association with CSF-1 mRNA and found that GAPDH small interfering RNA reduces both CSF-1 mRNA and protein levels by destabilizing CSF-1 mRNA CSF-1 mRNA half-lives were decreased by 50 in the presence of GAPDH small interfering RNA RNA footprinting analysis of the 144 nt CSF-1 sequence revealed that GAPDH associates with a large AU-rich-containing region The effects of binding of GAPDH protein or extracts to mutations of the AU-rich regions within the footprint were consistent with this finding In a tissue array containing 256 and tube cancer specimens we found that GAPDH was regulated in these cancers with almost 50 of specimens having no GAPDH staining Furthermore we found that low GAPDH staining was associated with a low CSF-1 score P 0.008 In summary GAPDH a multifunctional protein now adds regulation of mRNA stability to its repertoire We are the first to evaluate the clinical role of GAPDH protein in cancer In cancers we show that GAPDH expression is regulated and we now recognize that one of the many functions of GAPDH is to promote mRNA stability of CSF-1 an important cytokine in tumor progression,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[242, 23095, 27, 4849, 2374, 292, 12271, 8904, 9, 9595, 3697, 2531, 71, 319, 85, 440, 3, 1336, 10158, 59, 12271, 2, 182, 1, 956, 2769, 71, 1737, 85, 1229, 761, 21, 1027, 12271, 791, 3, 9595, 3697, 2158, 4415, 5314, 1, 3, 1975, 2122, 161, 14, 1211, 14, 27, 7379, 1053, 8196, 92, 21, 224, 6, 40, 35, 956, 10960, 4467, 4, 12, 37, 1211, 14, 16, 1327, 438, 5, 3, 334, 356, 1, 7, 5, 12, 21, 565, 3, 583, 724, 1, 12271, 292, 248, 5, 1211, 14, 956, 2, 204, 17, 12271, 302, 3449, 893, 2389, 110, 1211, 14, 956, 2, 178, 148, 20, 19689, 1211, 14, 956, 1211, 14, 956, 1303, 6407, 11, 340, 20, 212, 4, 3, 463, 1, 12271, 302, 3449, 893, 893, 42873, 65, 1, 3, 4415, 5314, 1211, 14, 1532, 553, 17, 12271, 7326, 5, 8, 375, 9595, 3697, 1101, 1053, 3, 176, 1, 791, 1, 12271, 178, 15, 8162, 6, 138, 1, 3, 9595, 3697, 1374, 262, 3, 26736, 11, 925, 5, 26, 1567, 4, 8, 246, 1926, 1101, 7162, 2, 2330, 12, 623, 21, 204, 17, 12271, 10, 1065, 4, 46, 163, 5, 2214, 212, 1, 623, 1041, 77, 12271, 1029, 798, 21, 204, 17, 154, 12271, 1029, 10, 41, 5, 8, 154, 1211, 14, 368, 19, 13, 2155, 4, 1962, 12271, 8, 7354, 178, 1134, 6659, 863, 1, 956, 2769, 6, 211, 5306, 21, 32, 3, 157, 6, 376, 3, 38, 200, 1, 12271, 178, 4, 12, 4, 163, 21, 514, 17, 12271, 55, 16, 1065, 2, 21, 1134, 4237, 17, 104, 1, 3, 445, 1681, 1, 12271, 16, 6, 1617, 956, 2769, 1, 1211, 14, 35, 305, 1675, 4, 30, 91]",1647.0,"['glyceraldehyde', 'phosphate', 'dehydrogenase', 'gapdh', 'predilection', 'au', 'rich', 'element', 'ha', 'long', 'known', 'expected', 'connection', 'gapdh', 'control', 'mrna', 'stability', 'ha', 'recently', 'described', 'gapdh', 'binding', 'au', 'rich', 'terminal', 'nt', 'colony', 'stimulating', 'factor', 'csf', 'untranslated', 'region', 'utr', 'showed', 'mrna', 'decay', 'element', 'ovarian', 'csf', 'strongly', 'correlated', 'poor', 'prognosis', 'patient', 'ovarian', 'investigated', 'functional', 'significance', 'gapdh', 'association', 'csf', 'mrna', 'gapdh', 'small', 'interfering', 'rna', 'reduces', 'csf', 'mrna', 'level', 'destabilizing', 'csf', 'mrna', 'csf', 'mrna', 'half', 'life', 'decreased', 'presence', 'gapdh', 'small', 'interfering', 'rna', 'rna', 'footprinting', 'nt', 'csf', 'sequence', 'revealed', 'gapdh', 'associate', 'large', 'au', 'rich', 'containing', 'region', 'effect', 'binding', 'gapdh', 'ovarian', 'extract', 'au', 'rich', 'region', 'footprint', 'consistent', 'finding', 'tissue', 'array', 'containing', 'ovarian', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'specimen', 'gapdh', 'wa', 'regulated', 'specimen', 'gapdh', 'staining', 'furthermore', 'low', 'gapdh', 'staining', 'wa', 'associated', 'low', 'csf', 'score', 'summary', 'gapdh', 'multifunctional', 'add', 'regulation', 'mrna', 'stability', 'repertoire', 'evaluate', 'clinical', 'role', 'gapdh', 'ovarian', 'gapdh', 'expression', 'regulated', 'recognize', 'function', 'gapdh', 'promote', 'mrna', 'stability', 'csf', 'important', 'cytokine', 'progression']",18708368,70,0.4069767441860465

At a planned analysis following first stage accrual, the dose was reduced to 175 mg/m(2) Cohort 2) for additional accrual to 78 patients. RECIST and CTC toxicity criteria were used. Patients received PPX in the second line (15%) and third line (85%) setting. In cohort 2, 25 out of 47 determined cases (53%) were platinum resistant and 17 out of 43 determined cases (40%) were taxane-resistant. The overall response rates for cohort 2 were 0/49 (0%) CR, 8/49 (16%) PR, and 20/49 (41%) SD. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (95% CI 1.48-4.8 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.4 months.

Oncol.,2008-10-16,"The aim was to describe the rate of laparoscopic trocar-related subcutaneous tumor implants in women with underlying malignant disease. An analysis of a prospective database of all patients undergoing transperitoneal laparoscopic procedures for malignant conditions performed by the gynecologic oncology service. Between July 1991 and April 2007, laparoscopic procedures were performed in 1694 patients with a malignant intraabdominal condition and in 505 breast cancer patients undergoing risk-reducing, diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopic procedures without intraabdominal disease. Port-site metastases were documented in 20 of 1694 patients (1.18%) who underwent laparoscopic procedures for a malignant intraabdominal condition. Of these, 15 patients had a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube carcinoma, 2 had breast cancer, 2 had cervical cancer, and 1 had uterine cancer. Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) had simultaneous carcinomatosis or metastases to other sites at the time of port-site metastasis. Patients who developed port-site metastases within 7 months from the laparoscopic procedure had a median survival of 12 months whereas patients who developed port-site metastasis >7 months had a median survival of 37 months (P=0.004). No port-site recurrence was documented in patients undergoing risk-reducing, diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopic procedures for breast cancer without intraabdominal disease. The rate of port-site tumor implantation after laparoscopic procedures in women with malignant disease is low and almost always occurs in the setting of synchronous, advanced intraabdominal or distant metastatic disease.

In this phase II study, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer were treated with subcutaneous GM-CSF and rIFN-gamma1b before and after intravenous carboplatin until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients had measurable disease and a chemotherapy-free interval >6 months. Response was determined using RECIST criteria and CA 125 levels. Between 2003 and 2007, 59 patients received a median of 6 cycles of therapy (range, 1 to 13 cycles). Median age at enrollment was 61 years (range, 35 to 79 years). Median time to progression prior to enrollment was 11 months (range, 6 to 58 months). Of 54 patients evaluable for response, 9 (17%) had a complete response, 21 (39%) had a partial response, and 24 (44%) had progressive disease. The overall response rate was 56% (95% CI: 41% to 69%).

Nevertheless, its recognition is important because the prognosis and treatment differ from that of primary breast cancer. We report a unique case of primary peritoneal serous carcinoma that initially presented as inflammatory breast cancer. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and subsequently underwent bilateral total mastectomy and bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy. She was found to have extensive intralymphatic carcinoma in both breasts, with only focal minimal breast parenchymal involvement, and residual metastatic carcinoma in bilateral sentinel lymph nodes. Further work-up revealed pelvic ascites and omental nodularities. The patient underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which revealed high-grade serous carcinoma involving both ovaries and fallopian tubes. Molecular testing of tumor from the ovary and axillary lymph node showed an identical pattern of allelic loss, confirming a common origin for both tumors.

Clin. Oncol.,2009-10-13,"Angiogenesis is important for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) growth, and blocking angiogenesis can lead to EOC regression. Cediranib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) -1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and c-kit. We conducted a phase II study of cediranib for recurrent EOC or peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer; cediranib was administered as a daily oral dose, and the original dose was 45 mg daily. Because of toxicities observed in the first 11 patients, the dose was lowered to 30 mg. Eligibility included <or= two lines of chemotherapy for recurrence.

The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS): a model for the initiation of p53 signatures in the distal Fallopian tube.,The Journal of pathology,J. Pathol.,2010-01-01,"A candidate early precursor to pelvic serous cancer, the 'p53 signature', is commonly found in the benign mucosa of the distal Fallopian tube and harbours p53 mutations and evidence of DNA damage. We examined tubes from women with pre-existing (germ-line) mutations in p53 [Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)] for evidence of this precursor. Fallopian tubes from two cases of LFS were immunostained for p53, Ki-67 (proliferation) and H2AX (DNA damage response) and analysed for p53 mutations by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and p53 genomic sequencing (exons 2-11). A common single nucleotide repeat (snp) in exon 3 (rs1042522) and deletion sequencing chromatograms in exon 4 were examined in combination to estimate LOH in both LFS tubes and advanced serous carcinomas from the general population. LFS tubal epithelium contained abundant (10-20 per section) p53 signatures with evidence of DNA damage and low proliferative activity. Six of 11 LFS microdissected p53 signatures (55%) and 15 of 21 serous carcinomas (71%) revealed LOH at the p53 locus, relative to background epithelium. The LFS model confirms prior observations that the distal Fallopian tube is particularly prone to focal epithelial p53 gene inactivation-p53 mutation and LOH-in the absence of malignancy or increased epithelial proliferation. The fact that the LFS is not associated with ovarian cancers is consistent with the concept that loss of p53 function must be accompanied by at least one more genotoxic event (including BRCA1/2 functional inactivation) to produce the malignant phenotype. This is in keeping with a general model of carcinogenesis, in which different and often independent risk factors operate at multiple points in the serous carcinogenic spectrum.",Journal Article,3672.0,30.0,A candidate early precursor to pelvic serous cancer the 'p53 signature is commonly found in the benign mucosa of the distal tube and harbours p53 mutations and evidence of DNA damage We examined tubes from women with pre-existing germ-line mutations in p53 Li-Fraumeni syndrome LFS for evidence of this precursor tubes from two cases of LFS were immunostained for p53 Ki-67 proliferation and H2AX DNA damage response and analysed for p53 mutations by laser capture microdissection LCM and p53 genomic sequencing exons 2-11 A common single nucleotide repeat snp in exon 3 rs1042522 and deletion sequencing chromatograms in exon 4 were examined in combination to estimate LOH in both LFS tubes and advanced serous carcinomas from the general population LFS tubal epithelium contained abundant 10-20 per section p53 signatures with evidence of DNA damage and low proliferative activity Six of 11 LFS microdissected p53 signatures 55 and 15 of 21 serous carcinomas 71 revealed LOH at the p53 locus relative to background epithelium The LFS model confirms prior observations that the distal tube is particularly prone to focal epithelial p53 gene inactivation-p53 mutation and LOH-in the absence of malignancy or increased epithelial proliferation The fact that the LFS is not associated with cancers is consistent with the concept that loss of p53 function must be accompanied by at least one more genotoxic event including BRCA1/2 functional inactivation to produce the malignant phenotype This is in keeping with a general model of carcinogenesis in which different and often independent risk factors operate at multiple points in the serous carcinogenic spectrum,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 1609, 191, 2765, 6, 1110, 1744, 12, 3, 45725, 1651, 16, 841, 204, 4, 3, 1002, 2713, 1, 3, 2107, 2330, 2, 25058, 624, 138, 2, 241, 1, 261, 1350, 21, 409, 6193, 29, 117, 5, 671, 1692, 2280, 328, 138, 4, 624, 5066, 9130, 681, 5674, 9, 241, 1, 26, 2765, 6193, 29, 100, 140, 1, 5674, 11, 12173, 9, 624, 2311, 598, 457, 2, 6286, 261, 1350, 51, 2, 3141, 9, 624, 138, 20, 3555, 2891, 8338, 12376, 2, 624, 572, 615, 3885, 18, 175, 8, 186, 226, 1579, 2334, 1845, 4, 1725, 27, 58334, 2, 1528, 615, 43979, 4, 1725, 39, 11, 409, 4, 150, 6, 1191, 2594, 4, 110, 5674, 6193, 2, 131, 1744, 826, 29, 3, 1083, 266, 5674, 6674, 2781, 3070, 4834, 79, 179, 379, 2917, 624, 2210, 5, 241, 1, 261, 1350, 2, 154, 2441, 128, 437, 1, 175, 5674, 9418, 624, 2210, 614, 2, 167, 1, 239, 1744, 826, 792, 553, 2594, 28, 3, 624, 2474, 580, 6, 2426, 2781, 3, 5674, 202, 5120, 324, 2172, 17, 3, 2107, 2330, 16, 823, 7104, 6, 2137, 701, 624, 145, 2297, 624, 258, 2, 2594, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 710, 15, 101, 701, 457, 3, 1991, 17, 3, 5674, 16, 44, 41, 5, 163, 16, 925, 5, 3, 2545, 17, 407, 1, 624, 343, 1642, 40, 2756, 20, 28, 506, 104, 80, 7876, 774, 141, 766, 18, 583, 2297, 6, 2410, 3, 393, 1005, 26, 16, 4, 10991, 5, 8, 1083, 202, 1, 1719, 4, 92, 338, 2, 629, 306, 43, 130, 15680, 28, 232, 862, 4, 3, 1744, 7483, 1873]",1661.0,"['candidate', 'early', 'precursor', 'pelvic', 'serous', 'signature', 'commonly', 'benign', 'mucosa', 'distal', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'harbour', 'evidence', 'dna', 'damage', 'examined', 'tube', 'woman', 'pre', 'existing', 'germ', 'line', 'li', 'fraumeni', 'syndrome', 'lf', 'evidence', 'precursor', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'case', 'lf', 'immunostained', 'ki', 'proliferation', 'ax', 'dna', 'damage', 'response', 'analysed', 'laser', 'capture', 'microdissection', 'lcm', 'genomic', 'sequencing', 'exon', 'common', 'single', 'nucleotide', 'repeat', 'snp', 'exon', 'deletion', 'sequencing', 'chromatogram', 'exon', 'examined', 'combination', 'estimate', 'loh', 'lf', 'tube', 'advanced', 'serous', 'carcinoma', 'general', 'population', 'lf', 'tubal', 'epithelium', 'contained', 'abundant', 'section', 'signature', 'evidence', 'dna', 'damage', 'low', 'proliferative', 'activity', 'lf', 'microdissected', 'signature', 'serous', 'carcinoma', 'revealed', 'loh', 'locus', 'relative', 'background', 'epithelium', 'lf', 'model', 'confirms', 'prior', 'observation', 'distal', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'particularly', 'prone', 'focal', 'epithelial', 'inactivation', 'loh', 'absence', 'malignancy', 'increased', 'epithelial', 'proliferation', 'fact', 'lf', 'associated', 'ovarian', 'consistent', 'concept', 'loss', 'function', 'accompanied', 'genotoxic', 'event', 'including', 'brca', 'functional', 'inactivation', 'produce', 'malignant', 'phenotype', 'keeping', 'general', 'model', 'carcinogenesis', 'different', 'independent', 'risk', 'factor', 'operate', 'multiple', 'point', 'serous', 'carcinogenic', 'spectrum']",19834951,18,0.10465116279069768
"Clinical activity of gemcitabine plus pertuzumab in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-09,"Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) heterodimerization and has single-agent activity in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. The primary objective of this phase II study was to characterize the safety and estimate progression-free survival (PFS) of pertuzumab with gemcitabine in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Patients with advanced, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who had received a maximum of one prior treatment for recurrent cancer were randomly assigned to gemcitabine plus either pertuzumab or placebo. Collection of archival tissue was mandatory to permit exploration of biomarkers that would predict benefit from pertuzumab in this setting. One hundred thirty patients (65 per arm) were treated. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.43 to 1.03; P = .07) in favor of gemcitabine + pertuzumab. The objective response rate was 13.8% in patients who received gemcitabine + pertuzumab compared with 4.6% in patients who received gemcitabine + placebo. In patients whose tumors had low HER3 mRNA expression (< median, n = 61), an increased treatment benefit was observed in the gemcitabine + pertuzumab arm compared with the gemcitabine alone arm (PFS HR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.59; P = .0002). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, diarrhea, and back pain were increased in patients treated with gemcitabine + pertuzumab.

"Phase II study of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab with maintenance bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy for advanced mullerian tumors.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-11-16,"PURPOSE New strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor but is associated with GI perforations (GIPs) in patients with recurrent disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS An open-label, phase II clinical trial was conducted in newly diagnosed patients with stage > or = IC epithelial müllerian tumors. Patients received intravenous (IV) carboplatin (area under the curve = 5), paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) IV), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV) for six to eight cycles on day 1 every 21 days. Bevacizumab was omitted in the first cycle and continued as a single agent for 1 year. Results Sixty-two women participated in this study. Fifty-one patients (82%) were optimally surgically cytoreduced before treatment. The median age was 58 years (range, 18 to 77 years). Forty-five women (73%) had ovarian cancer, 10 (16%) had peritoneal cancer, four (6%) had fallopian tube cancers, and three (5%) had uterine papillary serous tumors. The majority of patients (90%) had stage III or IV disease. A median of 17 maintenance cycles (range, 0 to 25+ cycles) of bevacizumab (556 cycles) were administered with mild toxicity. Treatment was associated with two pulmonary embolisms and two GIPs, all occurring during the chemotherapy phase of treatment (364 total cycles). No grade 4 toxicities were seen during maintenance bevacizumab treatment. Radiographic responses were documented in 21 (75%) of 28 women with measurable disease (11 complete responses and 10 partial responses), with CA-125 responses in 76% of patients (11 complete responses, 21%; and 35 partial responses, 55%).

The prophylactic conversion to an extended infusion schedule and use of premedication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions in ovarian cancer patients during carboplatin retreatment.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2009-11-27,"Repeated exposure to carboplatin can lead to hypersensitivity reactions during retreatment with carboplatin. This may prevent its further use in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients. At our institution, an increasing proportion of patients are prophylactically converted to an extended schedule of infusion after 8 cycles of carboplatin. We sought to determine whether an incrementally increasing, extended 3-hour infusion of carboplatin with appropriate premedication was associated with a lower rate of hypersensitivity reactions compared to the standard 30-minute schedule in sequentially treated patients. We performed a retrospective electronic medical record review of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer retreated with carboplatin at our institution from January 1998 to December 2008. Seven hundred and seventy-seven patients with relapsed ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer were retreated with carboplatin and met study inclusion criteria. Of these, 117 (17%) developed hypersensitivity reactions during second-line or greater carboplatin-based treatment for recurrent disease. Only 6 (3.4%) of the 174 patients who received the extended schedule developed hypersensitivity reactions (0% grade 4; 50% grade 3) compared to 111 (21%) of 533 patients in the standard schedule group (13% grade 4; 77% grade 3). The first hypersensitivity episode occurred after a median of 16 platinum (carboplatin and cisplatin) treatments in the extended group compared to 9 in the standard group. Using the Fisher exact test, there was an association with a reduced incidence of hypersensitivity reactions with the extended infusion schedule (P<0.001).

Occult ovarian cancers identified at risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in a prospective cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2010-02-24,"Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is widely used for cancer risk reduction in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation carriers. Occult ovarian/fallopian tube cancers (OOC) detected at the time of RRSO have been reported in several studies with wide variability in reported prevalence. We estimated the prevalence of OOC in a prospective cohort of 647 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from 18 centers (PROSE consortium) who underwent RRSO between 2001 and 2008. OOC was detected in 16 of 647 women (2.5%). The mean age at RRSO was 51.7 in those with OOC versus 46.6 in those without OOC (P = 0.017). Twelve of the 16 OOCs (75%) were diagnosed in women with BRCA1 mutations. Thirty-eight percent of women with OOC had stage 1 cancer versus none of the women in the PROSE database diagnosed with ovarian cancer outside of screening. Among 385 women (60%) in whom pathology reports were available for central review, 246 (64%) RRSOs were performed at participating PROSE centers while 139 (36%) were performed at local sites. Ovarian and fallopian tube tissues removed at major genetics referral centers were significantly more likely to have been examined in toto compared to specimens obtained at non-referral centers (75% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). Our results confirm that OOC may be found at the time of RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and suggest that OOC are of a more favorable stage than cancers found outside RRSO.

Evaluation of EVI1 and EVI1s (Delta324) as potential therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-05-11,"The MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus (MECOM) at 3q26 gives rise to several alternatively spliced transcripts implicated in leukemic oncogenesis. Overexpression of EVI1 in ovarian cancer has led to a proposed oncogenic role. Our objective was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of EVI1 and EVI1s (also known as Delta324) in ovarian cancer. Expression of EVI1 mRNA and protein isoforms was evaluated in ovarian cancers, normal ovaries, benign ovarian neoplasms, and fallopian tube fimbria. Effects of EVI1 isoform overexpression and knockdown on proliferation, cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and double stranded DNA breaks were investigated. EVI1 and EVI1s mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in ovarian cancers and benign gynecologic tissues examined, with highest expression of both isoforms noted in the cancer samples. The EVI1s to total EVI1 mRNA ratio was uniform among the examined tissues. In contrast, EVI1 protein isoform levels were undetectable in normal ovarian tissues, and highest in serous ovarian cancers. EVI1 protein expression patterns were similar between serous ovarian cancer samples, fallopian tube fimbria, and benign neoplasms. Expression of EVI1 or EVI1s did not increase proliferation in EVI1-null OVCAR8 cells. Total and isoform selective knockdown of EVI1 isoforms in EVI1 expressing ovarian cancer cells had no effect on proliferation, cisplatin-induced apoptosis, or gamma-H2AX levels in ovarian cancer cells. Our data do not support a role for EVI1 or EVI1s in ovarian cancer cell proliferation or response to DNA damage.

Erlotinib added to carboplatin and paclitaxel as first-line treatment of ovarian cancer: a phase II study based on surgical reassessment.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2010-09-15,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether adding the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib to carboplatin/paclitaxel improved pathologic complete response (pCR) at reassessment surgery in epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers (OFPC). Patients with stage III-IV OFPC initiated treatment within 12 weeks of initial cytoreductive surgery or, after histologic confirmation of diagnosis, neoadjuvantly. Treatment included paclitaxel (175 mg/m²) and carboplatin (AUC 6) every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, plus oral erlotinib 150 mg daily. The primary objective was to determine whether the pCR rate at reassessment surgery was at least 60% after optimal cytoreduction at initial surgery (< 1cm residual disease), or at least 40% after suboptimal cytoreduction (at least 1cm residual disease) using a two-stage design (alpha=0.10, beta=0.10). The study population included 56 patients with stage III-IV OFPC. EGFR gene amplification was present in 15% of the 20 tumors evaluated.

Oncol.,2010-12-01,"We sought to determine if patient age influenced chemotherapy completion rate, complication rate, or progression free survival (PFS) among patients who received intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers. Charts for patients receiving IP chemotherapy between January 2006 and September 2009 were reviewed at three institutions. Primary outcomes included completion rate of planned IP chemotherapy, complication rate, and PFS. Completion rates were categorized as 0-49%, 50-99%, or 100% of planned treatments were delivered. The tolerability of IP versus intravenous (IV) chemotherapy was also compared among patients ≥ 70 years. One hundred nine patients receiving IP chemotherapy were identified, 86 were < 70 years and 23 were ≥ 70 years. All patients received IP cisplatin and paclitaxel in combination with IV paclitaxel or docetaxel. Patients ≥ 70 years old were less likely to complete all planned cycles of IP chemotherapy than the younger cohort (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.83, p = 0.01), but there was no significant association between age and complication rate or PFS (p = 0.82 and p = 0.68, respectively).

Oncol.,2010-11-05,"To evaluate clinical activity of weekly topotecan plus carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. An open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I/II study. Phase II was the activity assessment phase, with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Eligible patients (females aged ≥18 years) received study treatment at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) identified in Phase I: intravenous topotecan 2.5mg/m(2) (Days 1 and 8), followed by carboplatin AUC 5 (Day 1), every 21 days. A two-stage Green-Dahlberg design was used to assess efficacy of treatment. An ORR of ≤30% was required to conclude that treatment was ineffective. Twenty-two patients in Phase I permitted identification of the MTD. In Phase II, 55 patients (median age 64.0 years) were enrolled and included in the intent-to-treat population. There were six complete responses (10.9%) and 11 partial responses (20.0%), giving an ORR of 30.9% (17 patients; 95% CI: 18.7%, 43.1%). Median time to response and progression-free survival were 6.57 weeks (95% CI: 5.86, 12.57) and 44.29 weeks (95% CI: 36.14, 52.14), respectively.

Low-dose abdominal radiation as a docetaxel chemosensitizer for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer: a phase I study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-02-01,"The aim of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of whole abdomen radiation as a chemosensitizer of weekly docetaxel for women with recurrent epithelial ovarian fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers. Women were enrolled on one of three dose levels of docetaxel (20, 25, or 30 mg/m(2)) administered weekly with concurrent low-dose whole abdominal radiation given as 60 cGy bid 2 days weekly for a total of 6 weeks. Thirteen women were enrolled and received 70 weekly treatments of docetaxel in combination with radiation therapy. At the first dose level, docetaxel 25mg/m(2), grade 3 fatigue and thrombocytopenia were observed. At the next dose level, docetaxel 30 mg/m(2), grade 3 febrile neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia with epistaxis, and grade 3 diarrhea were observed. Given these dose-limiting toxicities, a lower dose of docetaxel 20mg/m(2) was administered and found to be tolerable. No objective responses were observed among the 10 patients with measurable disease; however, the median progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients was 3.3 months, and 3 of the patients with measurable disease were free of tumor progression after 6 months (30%; 90% confidence interval 8.7-61%). Twice weekly low-dose whole abdomen radiation during weekly docetaxel 20 mg/m(2) was well-tolerated. Given the PFS demonstrated in these women with resistant ovarian cancer, further study of whole abdominal radiation and concurrent chemotherapy may be warranted.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3276.0,30.0,The aim of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity DLT of whole abdomen radiation as a chemosensitizer of weekly docetaxel for women with recurrent epithelial tube or peritoneal cancers Women were enrolled on one of three dose levels of docetaxel 20 25 or 30 mg/m 2 administered weekly with concurrent low-dose whole abdominal radiation given as 60 cGy bid 2 days weekly for a total of 6 weeks Thirteen women were enrolled and received 70 weekly treatments of docetaxel in combination with radiation therapy At the first dose level docetaxel 25mg/m 2 grade 3 fatigue and thrombocytopenia were observed At the next dose level docetaxel 30 mg/m 2 grade 3 febrile neutropenia grade 4 thrombocytopenia with epistaxis and grade 3 diarrhea were observed Given these dose-limiting toxicities a lower dose of docetaxel 20mg/m 2 was administered and found to be tolerable No objective responses were observed among the 10 patients with measurable disease however the median progression-free survival PFS in all patients was 3.3 months and 3 of the patients with measurable disease were free of tumor progression after 6 months 30 90 confidence interval 8.7-61 Twice weekly low-dose whole abdomen radiation during weekly docetaxel 20 mg/m 2 was well-tolerated Given the PFS demonstrated in these women with resistant cancer further study of whole abdominal radiation and concurrent chemotherapy may be warranted,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 1130, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 689, 421, 61, 2, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 1, 902, 4036, 121, 22, 8, 23796, 1, 709, 621, 9, 117, 5, 387, 701, 2330, 15, 1639, 163, 117, 11, 346, 23, 104, 1, 169, 61, 148, 1, 621, 179, 243, 15, 201, 81, 188, 18, 468, 709, 5, 750, 154, 61, 902, 1467, 121, 447, 22, 335, 3071, 2793, 18, 162, 709, 9, 8, 181, 1, 49, 244, 3170, 117, 11, 346, 2, 103, 431, 709, 640, 1, 621, 4, 150, 5, 121, 36, 28, 3, 157, 61, 301, 621, 15905, 188, 18, 88, 27, 613, 2, 1340, 11, 164, 28, 3, 1305, 61, 301, 621, 201, 81, 188, 18, 88, 27, 2498, 778, 88, 39, 1340, 5, 12575, 2, 88, 27, 1172, 11, 164, 447, 46, 61, 817, 385, 8, 280, 61, 1, 621, 16403, 188, 18, 10, 468, 2, 204, 6, 40, 2668, 77, 461, 253, 11, 164, 107, 3, 79, 7, 5, 1884, 34, 137, 3, 52, 91, 115, 25, 300, 4, 62, 7, 10, 27, 27, 53, 2, 27, 1, 3, 7, 5, 1884, 34, 11, 115, 1, 30, 91, 50, 49, 53, 201, 424, 307, 268, 66, 67, 713, 936, 709, 154, 61, 902, 4036, 121, 190, 709, 621, 179, 81, 188, 18, 10, 149, 421, 447, 3, 300, 264, 4, 46, 117, 5, 436, 12, 195, 45, 1, 902, 1467, 121, 2, 750, 56, 68, 40, 1197]",1443.0,"['aim', 'wa', 'determine', 'maximum', 'tolerated', 'dose', 'dose', 'limiting', 'toxicity', 'dlt', 'abdomen', 'radiation', 'chemosensitizer', 'weekly', 'docetaxel', 'woman', 'recurrent', 'epithelial', 'ovarian', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'peritoneal', 'woman', 'enrolled', 'dose', 'level', 'docetaxel', 'mg', 'administered', 'weekly', 'concurrent', 'low', 'dose', 'abdominal', 'radiation', 'given', 'cgy', 'bid', 'day', 'weekly', 'total', 'week', 'thirteen', 'woman', 'enrolled', 'received', 'weekly', 'treatment', 'docetaxel', 'combination', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'dose', 'level', 'docetaxel', 'mg', 'grade', 'fatigue', 'observed', 'dose', 'level', 'docetaxel', 'mg', 'grade', 'febrile', 'neutropenia', 'grade', 'epistaxis', 'grade', 'diarrhea', 'observed', 'given', 'dose', 'limiting', 'toxicity', 'lower', 'dose', 'docetaxel', 'mg', 'wa', 'administered', 'tolerable', 'objective', 'response', 'observed', 'patient', 'measurable', 'disease', 'median', 'progression', 'free', 'survival', 'pfs', 'patient', 'wa', 'month', 'patient', 'measurable', 'disease', 'free', 'progression', 'month', 'confidence', 'interval', 'twice', 'weekly', 'low', 'dose', 'abdomen', 'radiation', 'weekly', 'docetaxel', 'mg', 'wa', 'tolerated', 'given', 'pfs', 'demonstrated', 'woman', 'resistant', 'ovarian', 'abdominal', 'radiation', 'concurrent', 'chemotherapy', 'warranted']",21075438,2,0.011627906976744186

All patients were treated until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or patient refusal. Insufficient accrual related to regimen I resulted in a redesign of the study as a single arm phase II trial assessing only regimen II. More complete efficacy data is presented for regimen II as enrollment on regimen I was insufficient for some analyses. A total of 81 patients were enrolled. One patient was ineligible. Fifteen patients received regimen I, while 65 patients were treated with regimen II. The response rate on regimen I (daily×5) was 27% (90% CI: 10-51%) and 12% (90% CI: 6-21%) on regimen II (weekly). The median PFS and OS were 4.8 and 27.8 months, respectively, for regimen II. Grade 3/4 neutropenia rate was 93% with daily×5 dosing and 28% for weekly treatment.

Microscopic and early-stage ovarian cancers in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: building a model for early BRCA-associated tumorigenesis.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2011-01-28,"Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is the cornerstone of ovarian cancer prevention in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Occult fallopian tube and ovarian cancers have been reported in a small percentage of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers undergoing RRSO. Here, we review our single-institution experience with RRSO in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers to characterize cases of microscopic cancers in these patients. At the time of RRSO, 7.9% of BRCA1 mutation carriers were diagnosed with microscopic fallopian tube or ovarian cancers and no cases were diagnosed in BRCA2 mutation carriers. The majority of the microscopic cancers include cases that were confined to the fallopian tubes, although there were also cases involving ovaries only or peritoneal washings only. This suggests that the site of origin may be in the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum for BRCA-associated serous cancers. However, an analysis of early-stage (stages I and II) ovarian and fallopian tube cancers diagnosed in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers confirms that the ovary is a preferred site for tumor growth with 11 of 14 early-stage cancers having a dominant ovarian mass. Overall, these data suggest that cancer initiation may occur in the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum, but tumor growth and progression are favored in the ovary.

Tubal origin of 'ovarian' low-grade serous carcinoma.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2011-06-24,"Ovarian low-grade serous carcinomas are thought to evolve in a stepwise fashion from ovarian epithelial inclusions, cystadenomas, and borderline tumors. The current study was designed to gain insight into the origins of low-grade serous carcinomas (tubal versus ovarian) by comparatively evaluating the morphologic (secretory and ciliated cell distribution) and immunophenotypic (using antibodies to PAX8, tubulin, calretinin, and Ki67) attributes of its putative precursor lesions, the normal tubal epithelium, and the overt malignancy. A total of 226 adnexal tissues from 178 patients were studied, including 98 adnexae removed for non-neoplastic indications, 48 serous cystadenomas, 42 serous borderline tumors, and 38 low-grade serous carcinomas. Normal distal tubal epithelium comprised an admixture of PAX8+/tubulin- secretory cells and PAX8-/tubulin+ ciliated cells with a proliferative index of ∼3%. The vast majority of ovarian surface epithelia displayed a mesothelial phenotype (calretinin+/PAX8-/tubulin-) and low proliferative index (0% (12 per 1000)), although 4% of cases also displayed foci with tubal phenotype (calretinin-/PAX8+/tubulin+). In contrast, most (78%) of the ovarian epithelial inclusions displayed a tubal phenotype and had a significantly higher proliferative index (1%) than ovarian surface epithelium, indicating that in most cases, the ovarian surface epithelium and ovarian epithelial inclusions are of different lineages. There was a progressive decrease in the population of ciliated cells, as evidenced by increasing secretory/ciliated cell ratio, from ovarian epithelial inclusions/cystadenomas to borderline tumors to low-grade serous carcinoma, indicating that the latter is a clonal expansion of secretory cells. Overall, the findings make a strong argument that the ovarian epithelial inclusions with a tubal phenotype is likely derived from fallopian tube through an intraovarian endosalpingiosis rather than through Mullerian metaplasia from ovarian surface epithelium. Genetic and molecular studies are needed to further confirm this finding as tubal origination of ovarian serous cancers will have a significant impact on ovarian cancer prevention and

Female patients of any age, at a single institution, undergoing laparoscopically-assisted intraperitoneal port placement after initial surgery for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer from January 2001 through December 2009. Laparoscopically assisted intra-peritoneal port placement. Thirty-three ports were successfully placed, with no conversions to laparotomy. Only 2 patients were unable to receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and there was 1 major complication (enterotomy) related to port placement. There were 6 cases of port dysfunction (17%); however, in 3 cases the port was replaced and subsequently functioned well. There were 2 cases of port infection necessitating port removal. The majority (81.8%) of patients were able to complete all planned cycles of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

"Combined weekly topotecan and biweekly bevacizumab in women with platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer: results of a phase 2 study.",Cancer,Cancer,2011-02-24,"A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the toxicity and efficacy of combined weekly topotecan and biweekly bevacizumab in patients with primary or secondary platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer (OC). Patients were treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 and topotecan 4 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until progressive disease (PD) or excessive toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), objective response, and toxicity. Patients (N = 40) received a median of 8 treatment cycles. Toxicity was generally mild or moderate, with neutropenia (18%), hypertension (20%), gastrointestinal toxicity (18%), pain (13%), metabolic toxicity (15%), bowel obstruction (10%), and cardiotoxicity (8%) being the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events. No bowel perforations, febrile neutropenia, or treatment-related deaths occurred. Median PFS and OS were 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-9.4) and 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.8-22.9), with 22 (55%) patients progression-free for ≥6 months. Ten (25%) patients had partial response (PR), 14 (35%) had stable disease (SD), and 16 (40%) had PD. Patients treated with 2 prior regimens received greater benefit than patients treated with 1: PR/SD, 78.9% versus 42.9% (P = .03); median PFS, 10.9 versus 2.8 months (P = .08); median OS, 22.9 versus 12.8 months (P = .02).

Oncol.,2011-08-05,"Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has shown a survival advantage over intravenous chemotherapy for women with newly diagnosed optimally debulked epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. However, significant toxicity has limited its acceptance. In an effort to reduce toxicity, the Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted a Phase I study to evaluate the feasibility of day 1 intravenous (IV) paclitaxel and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by day 8 IP paclitaxel on an every 21-day cycle. Patients with Stage IIB-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal carcinomas or carcinosarcoma received paclitaxel 135mg/m(2) IV over 3h followed by cisplatin 75mg/m(2) IP on day 1 and paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2) IP on day 8 of a 21 day cycle with 6 cycles planned. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as febrile neutropenia or dose-delay of greater than 2 weeks due to failure to recover counts, or Grade 3-5 non-hematologic toxicity occurring within the first 4 cycles of treatment. Twenty of 23 patients enrolled were evaluable and nineteen (95%) completed all six cycles of therapy. Three patients experienced a DLT consisting of infection with normal absolute neutrophil count, grade 3 hyperglycemia, and grade 4 abdominal pain.

It's not just for laparoscopy anymore: use of insufflation under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance by Interventional Radiologists for percutaneous placement of intraperitoneal chemotherapy catheters.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-08-15,"While intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy has shown significant survival benefits, the ability to successfully deliver IP chemotherapy has been limited. In GOG 172, surgically-placed IP catheters had a reported complication rate of 34%. In addition, IP catheters have to be placed surgically. We have developed a novel percutaneous placement technique for IP catheters in patients without ascites. This study was a retrospective analysis of all patients receiving percutaneously-placed IP catheters from 12/2008 to present. Catheters were placed using a two-step technique under conscious sedation. IP access was gained using ultrasound-guided peritoneal puncture over the right lobe of the liver. A 5 Fr catheter was placed into the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen insufflated with carbon dioxide (CO(2)). Access was gained in the RLQ once distention separated the bowel from the abdominal wall. A 14.5 Fr multi-side hole catheter was coiled in the pelvis, and a reservoir tunneled onto the lower anterior chest wall. For this analysis, abstracted data included patient demographics, indication for catheter placement, complications (procedural and with chemotherapy delivery), fluoroscopy time, and timing/indication of catheter removal. Eleven patients received IP catheters. The mean age was 58 years, mean body mass index was 27.1, and mean number of days from surgical debulking was 38. There were two stage 2, and eight stage 3 patients. Two patients had fallopian tube, and nine patients had ovarian cancer. All patients had an optimal debulking procedure. Seven of 11 patients also obtained central intravenous access when the IP port was placed. Follow-up data were as follows: Average fluoroscopy time was 9 min. One patient (9%) had an intra-procedural complication but the catheter was successfully placed. Zero patients had catheter-related complications in the course of receiving chemotherapy. Five of the 11 patients (45%) completed the planned IP chemotherapy treatments, with three additional patients (27%) currently receiving therapy. The remaining three patients (27%) discontinued chemotherapy for reasons unrelated to IP catheter function: two due to chemotherapy side effects, and one with sepsis from a perforated diverticulum. Thus far, our experience with percutaneous placement of IP catheters is associated with a low risk of catheter-related complications and high technical success rates. CO(2) insufflation may make peritoneal puncture easier and potentially safer.

"Topotecan in patients with BRCA-associated and sporadic platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-08-19,"To evaluate the efficacy of topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan, in patients with recurrent BRCA+ versus BRCA- ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal carcinomas. A single-institution retrospective analysis of platinum-resistant patients characterized for the presence or absence of known deleterious BRCA mutations. Patients received topotecan at a dose and schedule determined by their treating physician (five day or weekly). Response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed. A total of 50 patients (9 BRCA+, 41 BRCA-) were treated with topotecan. Both groups were well balanced in terms of age, stage, grade, and number of prior therapies. All patients had high-grade serous carcinoma. The clinical benefit rate in BRCA+ and BRCA- patients was 0% and 26.8% (6 PRs, 6 SDs), respectively (p=0.18). Median PFS in BRCA+ and BRCA- pts was 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.0-2.8 months) and 2.5 months (95%CI: 1.9-2.8 months), respectively (p=0.057).

"Phase 1-2 study of docetaxel plus aflibercept in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2011-10-10,"Biologically targeted therapies have been postulated as a viable strategy to improve outcomes for women with ovarian cancer. We assessed the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, relevant circulating and image-derived biomarkers, and clinical activity of combination aflibercept and docetaxel in this population. For the phase 1 (pharmacokinetic) study, eligible patients had measurable, recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma with a maximum of two prior chemotherapy regimens. Aflibercept was administered intravenously over three dose levels (2, 4, or 6 mg/kg; one dose every 21 days) to identify the maximum tolerated dose for the phase 2 study. Pharmacokinetics were assessed and dynamic imaging was done during a lead-in phase with single-agent aflibercept (cycle 0) and during combination therapy with intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)). Eligibility for the phase 2 study was the same as for phase 1. Patients were enrolled in a two-stage design and given aflibercept 6 mg/kg intravenously and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously, every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0. The trial has completed enrolment and all patients are now off study. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00436501. From the phase 1 study, the recommended phase 2 doses of aflibercept and docetaxel were found to be 6 mg/kg and 75 mg/m(2), respectively. Log-linear pharmacokinetics (for unbound aflibercept) were observed for the three dose levels. No dose-limiting toxicities were noted. 46 evaluable patients were enrolled in the phase 2 trial; 33 were platinum resistant (15 refractory) and 13 were platinum sensitive. The confirmed ORR was 54% (25 of 46; 11 patients had a complete response and 14 had a partial response). Grade 3-4 toxicities observed in more than two patients (5%) were: neutropenia in 37 patients (80%); leucopenia in 25 patients (54%); fatigue in 23 patients (50%); dyspnoea in ten patients (22%); and stomatitis in three patients (7%). Adverse events specifically associated with aflibercept were grade 1-2 hypertension in five patients (11%), and grade 2 proteinuria in one patient (2%). Combination aflibercept plus docetaxel can be safely administered at the dose and schedule reported here, and is associated with substantial antitumour activity. These findings suggest that further clinical development of this combination in ovarian cancer is warranted.

Molecular requirements for transformation of fallopian tube epithelial cells into serous carcinoma.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2011-10-01,"Although controversial, recent studies suggest that serous ovarian carcinomas may arise from fallopian tube fimbria rather than ovarian surface epithelium. We developed an in vitro model for serous carcinogenesis in which primary human fallopian tube epithelial cells (FTECs) were exposed to potentially oncogenic molecular alterations delivered by retroviral vectors. To more closely mirror in vivo conditions, transformation of FTECs was driven by the positive selection of growth-promoting alterations rather antibiotic selection. Injection of the transformed FTEC lines in SCID mice resulted in xenografts with histologic and immunohistochemical features indistinguishable from poorly differentiated serous carcinomas. Transcriptional profiling revealed high similarity among the transformed and control FTEC lines and patient-derived serous ovarian carcinoma cells and was used to define a malignancy-related transcriptional signature. Oncogene-treated FTEC lines were serially analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis to identify oncogenes whose expression was subject to positive selection. The combination of p53 and Rb inactivation (mediated by SV40 T antigen), hTERT expression, and oncogenic C-MYC and HRAS accumulation showed positive selection during transformation. Knockdown of each of these selected components resulted in significant growth inhibition of the transformed cell lines that correlated with p27 accumulation. The combination of SV40 T antigen and hTERT expression resulted in immortalized cells that were nontumorigenic in mice, whereas forced expression of a dominant-negative p53 isoform (p53DD) and hTERT resulted in senescence.

Improved survival for BRCA2-associated serous ovarian cancer compared with both BRCA-negative and BRCA1-associated serous ovarian cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-12-02,"Multiple observational studies have suggested that breast cancer gene (BRCA)-associated ovarian cancers have improved survival compared with BRCA-negative ovarian cancers. However, most of those studies combined BRCA1 and BRCA2 patients or evaluated only BRCA1 patients. The objective of the current study was to examine whether BRCA1-associated and BRCA2-associated ovarian cancers were associated with different outcomes. This was a single-institution, retrospective analysis of patients who had a new diagnosis of histologically confirmed stage III or IV serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer between January 1, 1996 and February 1, 2011 and who underwent BRCA mutation testing on 1 of 2 institutional review board-approved follow-up studies. Patients who had been tested for BRCA mutations beyond 24 months of diagnosis were excluded from analysis to minimize selection bias from including patients who were referred for genetic testing because of long survival. Data from 190 patients (143 BRCA-negative patients, 30 BRCA1-positive patients, and 17 BRCA2-positive patients) were analyzed. During the study period, 73 deaths were observed (60 BRCA-negative patients, 10 BRCA1-positive patients, 3 BRCA2-positive patients). The median follow-up for the remaining 117 survivors was 2.5 years. At 3 years, 69.4%, 90.7%, and 100% of BRCA-negative patients, BRCA1-positive patients, and BRCA2-positive patients were alive, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, BRCA2 mutations, debulking status, and type of first-line therapy (intravenous or intraperitoneal) were significant predictors of overall survival. On multivariate analysis, BRCA2 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.65; P = .007), but not BRCA1 mutations (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.38; P = .31), predicted for improved overall survival compared with BRCA-negative patients. When carriers of BRCA2 mutations were directly compared with carriers of BRCA1 mutations, BRCA2 mutations appeared to confer improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-1.05; P = .060), although this finding did not reach significance. The current data suggests that BRCA2 mutations confer an overall survival advantage compared with either being BRCA-negative or having a BRCA1 mutation in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. This finding may have important implications for clinical trial design.",Comparative Study,2972.0,50.0,Multiple observational studies have suggested that cancer gene BRCA -associated cancers have

"A phase I study with an expanded cohort to assess the feasibility of intravenous paclitaxel, intraperitoneal carboplatin and intraperitoneal paclitaxel in patients with untreated ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2011-12-11,"To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the feasibility of intravenous (IV) paclitaxel, intraperitoneal (IP) carboplatin, and IP paclitaxel in women with newly diagnosed Stages II-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Patients received escalating doses of paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IP on day 1 and paclitaxel IP 60 mg/m(2) on day 8. A standard 3+3 design was used in the escalation phase. A two-stage group sequential design with 20 patients at the MTD was used in the feasibility phase. Patient-reported neurotoxicity was assessed pre and post treatment. Patients were treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) IV and carboplatin IP from AUC 5-7 on day 1 and paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2) IP on day 8. The MTD was estimated at carboplatin AUC 6 IP and 25 patients enrolled at this dose level. Within the first 4 cycles, seven (35%) of twenty evaluable patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) including grade 4 thrombocytopenia (1), grade 3 neutropenic fever (3), >2 week delay due to ANC recovery (1), grade 3 LFT (1), and grade 3 infection (1). De-escalation to paclitaxel 135 mg/m(2) IV was given to improve the safety.

Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-19,"To estimate the efficacy and toxicity of AMG 386, an investigational peptide-Fc fusion protein that neutralizes the interaction between the Tie2 receptor and angiopoietin-1/2, plus weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) once weekly [QW], 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus intravenous AMG 386 10 mg/kg QW (arm A), AMG 386 3 mg/kg QW (arm B), or placebo QW (arm C). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, objective response, CA-125 response, safety, and pharmacokinetics. One hundred sixty-one patients were randomly assigned. Median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.1 months) in arm A, 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 8.0 months) in arm B, and 4.6 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 6.7 months) in arm C. The hazard ratio for arms A and B combined versus arm C was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.12; P = .165). Further analyses suggested an exploratory dose-response effect for PFS across arms (Tarone's test, P = .037). Objective response rates for arms A, B, and C were 37%, 19%, and 27%, respectively. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) in arms A, B, and C was 65%, 55%, and 64%, respectively. Frequent AEs included hypertension (8%, 6%, and 5% in arms A, B, and C, respectively), peripheral edema (71%, 51%, and 22% in arms A, B, and C, respectively), and hypokalemia (21%, 15%, and 5% in arms A, B, and C, respectively). AMG 386 exhibited linear pharmacokinetic properties at the tested doses. AMG 386 combined with weekly paclitaxel was tolerable, with a manageable and distinct toxicity profile.

Morphologic patterns associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotype in ovarian carcinoma.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2011-12-23,"This study was undertaken with the hypothesis that certain common morphologic features of ovarian carcinomas are predictably associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiencies. We selected 43 high-grade serous carcinomas diagnosed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center that were studied as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas pilot project. In addition to 12 randomly selected nonfamilial BRCA-unassociated cases, all 31 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center cases with BRCA1 or BRCA2 abnormality were included (n=43). Slides were examined to assess tumor architecture, mitotic index, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, and involvement of fallopian tube epithelium. Comparing BRCA1-associated cases (BRCA1 germline mutation, n=4, BRCA1 somatic mutation, n=6, BRCA1 promoter methylation, n=13) with unassociated cases (n=12) identified statistically significant differences in morphology. BRCA1-associated high-grade serous carcinomas had more frequent Solid, pseudoEndometrioid, and Transitional cell carcinoma-like morphology (SET features) (P=0.0045), higher mitotic indexes (P=0.012), more TILs (P=0.034), and either geographic or comedo necrosis (P=0.034). BRCA2-associated cases (germline mutation, n=4 and somatic mutation, n=4) tended to show SET features, but they were relatively deficient in TILs and necrosis. Two algorithms incorporating tumor architecture, necrosis, and either mitotic indexes or TILs separated cases that showed 2 of 3 features (BRCA1 associated) from those with 0 of 3 features (BRCA unassociated; P=0.0016 and P=0.0033). A test set comprising 9 BRCA1 germline mutants and 14 high-grade serous carcinoma controls lacking BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation was used to validate the algorithms, with specific emphasis on the ability to detect cases with BRCA1 germline mutation. Best results were obtained with the algorithm that incorporated SET features, necrosis, and mitotic index (P=0.0072; sensitivity of 1.0 (95% CI, 0.66-1.0); specificity of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.29-0.82); positive predictive value of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.32-0.84) and a negative predictive value of 1.0 (95% CI, 0.63-1.0)).

An orthotopic model of platinum-sensitive high grade serous fallopian tube carcinoma.,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,2011-01-01,"Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTCA) is a very rare cancer type, but may be a useful platform for investigating high grade serous tumors of the pelvis that originate from a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) precursor. Metastatic tumors from a patient diagnosed with Stage IIIC high grade serous FTCA (P0) were transplanted via intraperitoneal (IP) injection into a small cohort of mice (passage, P1). Patient information was obtained from the medical record. Tumors were grown, harvested and re-implanted or archived through P3. The P3 cohort was treated with saline (n=8) or cisplatin, 5 mg/kg (n=8), weekly for 4 weeks. After sacrifice, tumors from each passage and treatment group were passaged further, frozen or paraffin embedded. The patient underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery for Stage IIIC high grade serous FTCA in the presence of a STIC. The FTCA, areas of STIC and normal appearing FT stained positive for p53, PAX8, pH2AX and mib-1. The patient remained in remission 9 months after platinum-based chemotherapy. IP tumor propagation was readily achieved up to P3 in the mice. Similar to the patient, orthotopic tumors were identified along peritoneal and mesenteric surfaces. Tumor histopathological and molecular features were confirmed and maintained through P3. The P3 cisplatin-treated mice had fewer tumor implants, higher levels of pH2AX and lower levels of mib-1 expression compared to controls.

Imatinib (600 mg) was administered daily for one 6-week course and continued in the absence of toxicity and disease progression. Thirteen patients were enrolled; 12 were evaluable for toxicity, and 11 were evaluable for response. A total of 17 courses were administered (median, 1 course; range, 1-5 courses). Complete or partial responses were not observed. One patient had stable disease for 7.3 months. c-Kit, bcr-abl, or PDGFR-β were present in 48%, 77%, and 100% of patients, respectively. No correlation between best response (stable disease) and the presence of imatinib-targeted biomarkers was observed. Adverse events included grade 3 skin rash in one patient leading to discontinuation of the drug, and grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 2 weight gain in two patients leading to dose reductions.

"Minireview: human ovarian cancer: biology, current management, and paths to personalizing therapy.",Endocrinology,Endocrinology,2012-03-13,"More than 90% of ovarian cancers have been thought to arise from epithelial cells that cover the ovarian surface or, more frequently, line subserosal cysts. Recent studies suggest that histologically similar cancers can arise from the fimbriae of Fallopian tubes and from deposits of endometriosis. Different histotypes are observed that resemble epithelial cells from the normal Fallopian tube (serous), endometrium (endometrioid), cervical glands (mucinous), and vaginal rests (clear cell) and that share expression of relevant HOX genes which drive normal gynecological differentiation. Two groups of epithelial ovarian cancers have been distinguished: type I low-grade cancers that present in early stage, grow slowly, and resist conventional chemotherapy but may respond to hormonal manipulation; and type II high-grade cancers that are generally diagnosed in advanced stage and grow aggressively but respond to chemotherapy. Type I cancers have wild-type p53 and BRCA1/2, but have frequent mutations of Ras and Raf as well as expression of IGFR and activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Virtually all type II cancers have mutations of p53, and almost half have mutation or dysfunction of BRCA1/2, but other mutations are rare, and oncogenesis appears to be driven by amplification of several growth-regulatory genes that activate the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy with platinum compounds and taxanes have improved 5-yr survival, but less than 40% of all stages can be cured. Novel therapies are being developed that target high-grade serous cancer cells with PI3Kness or BRCAness as well as the tumor vasculature.

Does significant medical comorbidity negate the benefit of up-front cytoreduction in advanced ovarian cancer?,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2012-06-01,"The objective of the study was to determine if initial surgery (IS) or initial chemotherapy (IC) affects rates of optimal surgery and survival in a population with significant medical comorbidities. Data of all patients with stage III-IV ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers diagnosed from 1995 to 2008 were reviewed. Clinical and pathologic data were abstracted. There were 551 cases for review: 255 (46.3%) received IS, and 296 (53.7%) received IC. Patients who received IC had higher stage (P < 0.001), higher-grade cancers (P < 0.001), higher mean CA-125 (P = 0.015), higher rates of diabetes (P = 0.006), hypertension (P = 0.008), and presurgical embolism (P < 0.022) and were older (P = 0.043). There was no difference with respect to body mass index, albumin, extent of surgery, or intensive care use. Rates of optimal cytoreduction were higher with IC compared with IS (72.7% vs 56.1%, P < 0.001). IS was associated with more blood loss (P = 0.005) and higher rates of postsurgical venous thrombosis (P < 0.001). Optimal cytoreduction predicted survival in both groups. Among optimal patients, IS improved median survival: progression-free survival of 14 months (IS) versus 12 months (IC), P = 0.004; overall survival of 58 months (IS) versus 34 months (IC), P = 0.002. Factors influencing this difference were receipt of IC and history of diabetes; both predictors of mortality: hazard ratios, 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.8; P < 0.001) and 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.1; P = 0.042), respectively. The achievement of optimal cytoreduction continues to be a significant predictor of survival, regardless of treatment approach. Patients selected for IS and in whom optimal cytoreduction was achieved had improvements in both progression-free survival and overall survival. However, the differences could not be explained by surgical effort alone as diabetes was independently associated with mortality.",Journal Article,2790.0,7.0,The objective of the study was to

"Progression-free and overall survival of a modified outpatient regimen of primary intravenous/intraperitoneal paclitaxel and intraperitoneal cisplatin in ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2012-03-21,"GOG study 172 demonstrated improved progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival for patients with stage III optimally debulked ovarian and peritoneal carcinoma treated with IV/IP paclitaxel and IP cisplatin compared to standard IV therapy. The inpatient administration, toxicity profile, and limited completion rate have been blamed for the lack of acceptance and widespread use of this regimen. We sought to evaluate the PFS, OS, toxicity, and completion rate of a modified outpatient IP regimen. Using a prospectively maintained database, we evaluated the outcomes of patients who underwent primary optimal cytoreduction for stage III ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal carcinoma followed by IV/IP chemotherapy from 1/05-3/09. Our modified regimen was as follows: IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2)) over 3h on day 1, IP cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) on day 2, and IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m(2)) on day 8, given every 21 days for 6 cycles. We identified 102 patients who initiated the modified IV/IP regimen and completed chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 43 months. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 23-76). Primary disease site was: ovary, 77 (75%); fallopian tube, 13 (13%); peritoneum, 12 (12%). FIGO stage was: IIIA, 8 (8%); IIIB, 4 (4%); IIIC, 90 (88%). Residual disease after cytoreduction was: none, 58 (57%); ≤ 1 cm, 44 (43%). The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia, 12 (12%); gastrointestinal, 8 (8%); neurologic, 6 (6%).

Validation of an algorithm for the diagnosis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma.,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2012-05-01,"It has been reported that the diagnosis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) is not optimally reproducible on the basis of only histologic assessment. Recently, we reported that the use of a diagnostic algorithm that combines histologic features and coordinate immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Ki-67 substantially improves reproducibility of the diagnosis. The goal of the current study was to validate this algorithm by testing a group of 6 gynecologic pathologists who had not participated in the development of the algorithm (3 faculty and 3 fellows) but who were trained in its use by referring to a website designed for the purpose. They then reviewed a set of microscopic slides, which contained 41 mucosal lesions of the fallopian tube. Overall consensus (≥4 of 6 pathologists) for the 4 categories of STIC, serous tubal intraepithelial lesion (our atypical intermediate category), p53 signature, and normal/reactive was achieved in 76% of the lesions, with no consensus in 24%. Combining diagnoses into 2 categories (STIC versus non-STIC) resulted in an overall consensus of 93% and no consensus in 7%. The κ value for STIC versus non-STIC among all 6 observers was also high at 0.67 and did not significantly differ, whether for faculty (κ=0.66) or fellows (κ=0.60). These findings confirm the reproducibility of this algorithm by a group of gynecologic pathologists who were trained on a website for that purpose. Accordingly, we recommend its use in research studies. Before applying it to routine clinical practice, the algorithm should be evaluated by general surgical pathologists in a community setting.",Comparative Study,2821.0,77.0,It has been reported that the diagnosis of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma STIC is not optimally reproducible on the basis of only histologic assessment Recently we reported that the use of a diagnostic algorithm that combines histologic features and coordinate immunohistochemical expression of p53 and Ki-67 substantially improves reproducibility of the diagnosis The goal of the current study was to validate this algorithm by testing a group of 6 gynecologic pathologists who had not participated in the development of the algorithm 3 faculty and 3 fellows but who were trained in its use by referring to a website designed for the purpose They then reviewed a set of microscopic slides which contained 41 mucosal lesions of the tube Overall consensus ≥4 of 6 pathologists for the 4 categories of STIC serous tubal intraepithelial lesion our atypical intermediate category p53 signature and normal/reactive was achieved in 76 of the lesions with no consensus in 24 Combining diagnoses into 2 categories STIC versus non-STIC resulted in an overall consensus of 93 and no consensus in 7 The κ value for STIC versus non-STIC among all 6 observers was also high at 0.67 and did not significantly differ whether for faculty κ=0.66 or fellows κ=0.60 These findings confirm the reproducibility of this algorithm by a group of gynecologic pathologists who were trained on a website for that purpose Accordingly we recommend its use in research studies Before applying it to routine clinical practice the algorithm should be evaluated by general surgical pathologists in a community setting,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[192, 71, 85, 210, 17, 3, 147, 1, 1744, 6674, 4153, 134, 14034, 16, 44, 5074, 4172, 23, 3, 877, 1, 158, 884, 455, 761, 21, 210, 17, 3, 119, 1, 8, 752, 2124, 17, 6705, 884, 404, 2, 9767, 1382, 55, 1, 624, 2, 2311, 598, 2109, 1804, 4688, 1, 3, 147, 3, 1326, 1, 3, 291, 45, 10, 6, 2183, 26, 2124, 20, 471, 8, 87, 1, 49, 1512, 3354, 54, 42, 44, 3025, 4, 3, 193, 1, 3, 2124, 27, 11137, 2, 27, 7813, 84, 54, 11, 5946, 4, 211, 119, 20, 8636, 6, 8, 8262, 1114, 9, 3, 743, 491, 818, 446, 8, 916, 1, 2984, 3830, 92, 3070, 605, 3068, 406, 1, 3, 2330, 63, 1391, 5915, 1, 49, 3354, 9, 3, 39, 1996, 1, 14034, 1744, 6674, 4153, 1180, 114, 1973, 919, 2169, 624, 1651, 2, 295, 2163, 10, 513, 4, 846, 1, 3, 406, 5, 77, 1391, 4, 259, 1525, 2403, 237, 18, 1996, 14034, 185, 220, 14034, 627, 4, 35, 63, 1391, 1, 966, 2, 77, 1391, 4, 67, 3, 4627, 549, 9, 14034, 185, 220, 14034, 107, 62, 49, 8803, 10, 120, 64, 28, 13, 598, 2, 205, 44, 97, 1505, 317, 9, 11137, 4627, 13, 700, 15, 7813, 4627, 13, 335, 46, 272, 1843, 3, 4688, 1, 26, 2124, 20, 8, 87, 1, 1512, 3354, 54, 11, 5946, 23, 8, 8262, 9, 17, 743, 4705, 21, 2237, 211, 119, 4, 389, 94, 348, 4798, 192, 6, 1311, 38, 758, 3, 2124, 257, 40, 194, 20, 1083, 221, 3354, 4, 8, 1714, 546]",1592.0,"['ha', 'reported', 'diagnosis', 'serous', 'tubal', 'intraepithelial', 'carcinoma', 'stic', 'optimally', 'reproducible', 'basis', 'histologic', 'assessment', 'recently', 'reported', 'use', 'diagnostic', 'algorithm', 'combine', 'histologic', 'feature', 'coordinate', 'expression', 'ki', 'substantially', 'improves', 'reproducibility', 'diagnosis', 'goal', 'current', 'wa', 'validate', 'algorithm', 'testing', 'group', 'gynecologic', 'pathologist', 'participated', 'development', 'algorithm', 'faculty', 'fellow', 'trained', 'use', 'referring', 'website', 'designed', 'purpose', 'reviewed', 'set', 'microscopic', 'slide', 'contained', 'mucosal', 'lesion', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'overall', 'consensus', 'pathologist', 'category', 'stic', 'serous', 'tubal', 'intraepithelial', 'lesion', 'atypical', 'intermediate', 'category', 'signature', 'normal', 'reactive', 'wa', 'achieved', 'lesion', 'consensus', 'combining', 'diagnosis', 'category', 'stic', 'versus', 'non', 'stic', 'resulted', 'overall', 'consensus', 'consensus', 'value', 'stic', 'versus', 'non', 'stic', 'observer', 'wa', 'high', 'significantly', 'differ', 'faculty', 'fellow', 'finding', 'confirm', 'reproducibility', 'algorithm', 'group', 'gynecologic', 'pathologist', 'trained', 'website', 'purpose', 'accordingly', 'recommend', 'use', 'research', 'applying', 'routine', 'clinical', 'practice', 'algorithm', 'evaluated', 'general', 'surgical', 'pathologist', 'community', 'setting']",22498942,14,0.08139534883720931

Patients with platinum-sensitive ROC (recurrence ≥ 6 months after front-line platinum-based therapy) and measurable disease were randomly assigned to GC plus either BV or placebo (PL) for six to 10 cycles. BV or PL, respectively, was then continued until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST; secondary end points were objective response rate, duration of response (DOR), overall survival, and safety. Overall, 484 patients were randomly assigned. PFS for the BV arm was superior to that for the PL arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.484; 95% CI, 0.388 to 0.605; log-rank P < .0001); median PFS was 12.4 v 8.4 months, respectively.

Oncol.,2012-07-05,"Aurora A kinase (AAK), a key mitotic regulator, is implicated in the pathogenesis of several tumors, including ovarian cancer. This single-arm phase II study assessed single-agent efficacy and safety of the investigational AAK inhibitor MLN8237 (alisertib), in patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Adult women with malignant, platinum-treated disease received MLN8237 50mg orally twice daily for 7 days plus 14 days' rest (21-day cycles). The primary endpoint was combined objective tumor response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and/or CA-125 criteria. Secondary endpoints included response duration, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression (TTP), and safety. Thirty-one patients with epithelial ovarian (n=25), primary peritoneal (n=5), and fallopian tube carcinomas (n=1) were enrolled. Responses of 6.9-11.1 month duration were observed in 3 (10%) patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Sixteen (52%) patients achieved stable disease with a mean duration of response of 2.86 months and which was durable for ≥3 months in 6 (19%). Median PFS and TTP were 1.9 months. Most common drug-related grade≥3 adverse events were neutropenia (42%), leukopenia (23%), stomatitis, and thrombocytopenia (each 19%); 6% reported febrile neutropenia.

Risk of rash with the anti-HER2 dimerization antibody pertuzumab: a meta-analysis.,Breast cancer research and treatment,Breast Cancer Res. Treat.,2012-07-11,"Pertuzumab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) dimerization. It was recently approved by the US FDA for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Rash is inconsistently reported as a common adverse event in most clinical trials of pertuzumab, at varying incidences. In this study, we have investigated the overall incidence and risk of rash with pertuzumab. Relevant studies were identified from the PubMed database (1966-2012), abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual conference (2004-2011), and Web of Science database (1998-2012). Eligible studies were prospective phase II-III clinical trials using pertuzumab in cancer patients. Incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of included studies. Data from a total of 1,726 patients (pertuzumab, n = 1,157; controls, n = 569) with breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers from eight clinical trials were included for analysis. The incidence of all-grade and high-grade rash with pertuzumab were 24.6 % (95 % CI 19.3-30.8 %) and 1.1 % (95 % CI 0.5-2.2 %), respectively. The risk varied with tumor types, as patients with prostate cancer had a lower incidence of rash (13.2 %; 95 % CI 8.0-21.1 %) than those with breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer (P = 0.001). Overall, pertuzumab significantly increased the risk of rash in comparison with controls (RR 1.53; 95 % CI 1.12-2.09; P = 0.007).

Oncol.,2012-08-09,"Ovarian cancer is a highly angiogenic tumor and a model for antiangiogenic research. The tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors target several receptors allowing for the pharmacological disruption of several independent pathways. Sunitinib malate is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A phase II study utilizing a modified dosing schedule was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Sunitinib in recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinoma. A nonrandomized phase II study was modeled as a two-stage Simon design initially enrolling 17 evaluable participants in stage one and 18 patients in stage two. Patients received the study drug at 37.5mg every day over a 28 day treatment cycle until clinical or radiological evidence of progressive disease. Disease was evaluated radiographically and best overall response was defined using the RECIST 1.0 criteria. The primary objective of this study was to define the response rate (defined as complete response and partial response) while the secondary objectives included both the progression free rate as well as the safety of this agent in this patient population. The response rate (PR+CR) was 8.3% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%, 22.5%). The 16-week and 24 week progression-free survival estimate was 36% (95% confidence interval and 19.2%), respectively. The median progression-free survival estimate was 9.9 weeks. Hypertension and gastrointestional events were the most common toxicities noted.

Archival tumour tissue was obtained for correlative analyses. This was an open-label single-arm Phase II study of single agent ENMD-2076 taken daily orally (PO). The primary objective was to determine the progression free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months of ENMD-2076 in platinum-resistant cancer based on RECIST v1.1. Secondary objectives included response rate (RR), duration of response, overall survival (OS) and safety. An exploratory analysis of archival tissue for mitotic index and angiogenesis was conducted in an attempt to identify a sensitive or resistant patient phenotype. 64 patients were enrolled, and the PFS rate at 6 months was 22% with a median time to progression of 3.6 months. The median number of prior regimens was 2. The most common adverse events were fatigue, hypertension and diarrhoea with the most common Grade 3/4 events being hypertension and fatigue. None of the markers of mitotic index or angiogenesis evaluated in the archival tissue samples were predictive of greater benefit or resistance to ENMD-2076 treatment. ENMD-2076 has activity in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and observed toxicities were similar to other PO kinase inhibitors. Additional studies with ENMD-2076 are warranted, especially in combination with active chemotherapeutic agents in platinum-resistant patients. Further work to determine appropriate biomarkers for ENMD-2076 should be incorporated into new clinical studies.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2709.0,28.0,The purpose was to assess the activity and side effect profile of ENMD-2076 an oral anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative kinase inhibitor in platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial cancer EOC tube or peritoneal cancer Archival tumour tissue was obtained for correlative analyses This was an open-label single-arm Phase II study of single agent ENMD-2076 taken daily orally PO The primary objective was to determine the progression free survival PFS rate at 6 months of ENMD-2076 in platinum-resistant cancer based on RECIST v1.1 Secondary objectives included response rate RR duration of response overall survival OS and safety An exploratory analysis of archival tissue for mitotic index and angiogenesis was conducted in an attempt to identify a sensitive or resistant patient phenotype 64 patients were enrolled and the PFS rate at 6 months was 22 with a median time to progression of 3.6 months The median number of prior regimens was 2 The most common adverse events were fatigue hypertension and diarrhoea with the most common Grade 3/4 events being hypertension and fatigue None of the markers of mitotic index or angiogenesis evaluated in the archival tissue samples were predictive of greater benefit or resistance to ENMD-2076 treatment ENMD-2076 has activity in platinum-resistant cancer and observed toxicities were similar to other PO kinase inhibitors Additional studies with ENMD-2076 are warranted especially in combination with active chemotherapeutic agents in platinum-resistant patients Further work to determine appropriate biomarkers for ENMD-2076 should be incorporated into new clinical studies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 743, 10, 6, 423, 3, 128, 2, 1152, 254, 800, 1, 10371, 11360, 35, 518, 312, 2068, 2, 312, 2441, 216, 230, 4, 828, 436, 387, 701, 12, 2249, 2330, 15, 1639, 12, 3967, 770, 246, 10, 683, 9, 3679, 318, 26, 10, 35, 1020, 1756, 226, 475, 124, 215, 45, 1, 226, 420, 10371, 11360, 1633, 391, 1428, 4826, 3, 86, 461, 10, 6, 223, 3, 91, 115, 25, 300, 116, 28, 49, 53, 1, 10371, 11360, 4, 828, 436, 12, 90, 23, 1834, 7673, 14, 568, 2409, 159, 51, 116, 861, 654, 1, 51, 63, 25, 118, 2, 367, 35, 2386, 65, 1, 3967, 246, 9, 2346, 558, 2, 1056, 10, 426, 4, 35, 3448, 6, 255, 8, 745, 15, 436, 69, 1005, 660, 7, 11, 346, 2, 3, 300, 116, 28, 49, 53, 10, 350, 5, 8, 52, 98, 6, 91, 1, 27, 49, 53, 3, 52, 207, 1, 324, 472, 10, 18, 3, 96, 186, 290, 281, 11, 613, 1824, 2, 4959, 5, 3, 96, 186, 88, 27, 39, 281, 486, 1824, 2, 613, 1292, 1, 3, 525, 1, 2346, 558, 15, 1056, 194, 4, 3, 3967, 246, 347, 11, 464, 1, 378, 247, 15, 251, 6, 10371, 11360, 24, 10371, 11360, 71, 128, 4, 828, 436, 12, 2, 164, 385, 11, 288, 6, 127, 4826, 216, 222, 402, 94, 5, 10371, 11360, 32, 1197, 1093, 4, 150, 5, 544, 1573, 183, 4, 828, 436, 7, 195, 1357, 6, 223, 870, 582, 9, 10371, 11360, 257, 40, 2449, 237, 217, 38, 94]",1620.0,"['purpose', 'wa', 'ass', 'activity', 'effect', 'profile', 'enmd', 'oral', 'anti', 'angiogenic', 'anti', 'proliferative', 'kinase', 'inhibitor', 'platinum', 'resistant', 'recurrent', 'epithelial', 'ovarian', 'eoc', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'peritoneal', 'archival', 'tumour', 'tissue', 'wa', 'obtained', 'correlative', 'wa', 'open', 'label', 'single', 'arm', 'phase', 'ii', 'single', 'agent', 'enmd', 'taken', 'daily', 'orally', 'po', 'primary', 'objective', 'wa', 'determine', 'progression', 'free', 'survival', 'pfs', 'rate', 'month', 'enmd', 'platinum', 'resistant', 'based', 'recist', 'secondary', 'objective', 'included', 'response', 'rate', 'rr', 'duration', 'response', 'overall', 'survival', 'safety', 'exploratory', 'archival', 'tissue', 'mitotic', 'index', 'angiogenesis', 'wa', 'conducted', 'attempt', 'identify', 'sensitive', 'resistant', 'patient', 'phenotype', 'patient', 'enrolled', 'pfs', 'rate', 'month', 'wa', 'median', 'time', 'progression', 'month', 'median', 'number', 'prior', 'regimen', 'wa', 'common', 'adverse', 'event', 'fatigue', 'hypertension', 'diarrhoea', 'common', 'grade', 'event', 'hypertension', 'fatigue', 'marker', 'mitotic', 'index', 'angiogenesis', 'evaluated', 'archival', 'tissue', 'predictive', 'greater', 'benefit', 'resistance', 'enmd', 'treatment', 'enmd', 'ha', 'activity', 'platinum', 'resistant', 'ovarian', 'observed', 'toxicity', 'similar', 'po', 'kinase', 'inhibitor', 'additional', 'enmd', 'warranted', 'especially', 'combination', 'active', 'agent', 'platinum', 'resistant', 'patient', 'work', 'determine', 'appropriate', 'biomarkers', 'enmd', 'incorporated', 'new', 'clinical']",22921155,19,0.11046511627906977

Cancer Res.,2012-10-02,"Hedgehog pathway inhibition has been suggested as a potential maintenance treatment approach in ovarian cancer through disruption of tumor-stromal interactions. Vismodegib is an orally available Hedgehog pathway inhibitor with clinical activity in advanced basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. This phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to provide a preliminary estimate of efficacy in patients with ovarian cancer in second or third complete remission (CR). Patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in second or third CR were randomized 1:1 to vismodegib (GDC-0449; 150 mg daily) or placebo three to 14 weeks after completing chemotherapy. Treatment continued until radiographic progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). One hundred four patients were randomized to vismodegib (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52); median PFS was 7.5 months and 5.8 months, respectively [HR 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-1.35]. The HR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.36-1.20) for second CR patients (n = 84) and 1.79 (95% CI, 0.50-6.48) for third CR patients (n = 20). The most common adverse events in the vismodegib arm were dysgeusia/ageusia, muscle spasms, and alopecia.

Salpingo-oophorectomy specimens for endometrial cancer staging: a comparative analysis of representative sampling versus whole tissue processing.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2012-10-16,"Involvement of the ovary and/or fallopian tube by an endometrial cancer is uncommon but clinically significant because this is one of the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy. The authors evaluated whether the routine microscopic evaluation of the adnexal organs in this setting should be of the entire specimen or of representative sections. Slides and reports were reviewed for 105 consecutive patients who underwent a staging salpingo-oophorectomy (205 ovaries, 210 tubes) for endometrial carcinoma/carcinosarcoma. The study period encompassed the periods before and after an institutional policy change from discretionary (predominantly representative) adnexal sampling to obligatory total processing. Ninety-four and 111 ovaries (and 92 and 118 tubes) were entirely and representatively processed, respectively. Even when using the most expansive definition of ovarian gross abnormality (definition with the highest sensitivity and lowest specificity for microscopically confirmed cancer), we still identified 4 (of 148; 2.7%) grossly normal ovaries and 3 (of 187; 1.6%) grossly normal tubes that were found to harbor microscopic cancers. There was no significant increase in the number of grossly occult cancers detected after the policy change, and 5 (71%) of the 7 grossly occult cancers were in the representatively sampled group. Approximately 3.76 more blocks per patient were required for total overrepresentative processing, and the total cost of these additional sections was estimated to be $25.57 per patient. In conclusion, the 1.6% to 2.7% of grossly normal adnexa that proved to be cancerous represents, at least theoretically, the risk for misdiagnosis and understaging that is associated with representative sampling, at relatively modest savings. However, the findings in this study do not provide direct evidentiary support for routine complete processing.",Journal Article,2653.0,3.0,Involvement of the ovary and/or tube by an cancer is uncommon but clinically significant because this is one of the indications for adjuvant chemotherapy The authors evaluated whether the routine microscopic evaluation of the adnexal organs in this setting should be of the entire specimen or of representative sections Slides and reports were reviewed for 105 consecutive patients who underwent a staging salpingo-oophorectomy 205 ovaries 210 tubes for carcinoma/carcinosarcoma The study period encompassed the periods before and after an institutional policy change from discretionary predominantly representative adnexal sampling to obligatory total processing Ninety-four and 111 ovaries and 92 and 118 tubes were entirely and representatively processed respectively Even when using the most expansive definition of gross abnormality definition with the highest sensitivity and lowest specificity for microscopically confirmed cancer we still identified 4 of 148 2.7 grossly normal ovaries and 3 of 187 1.6 grossly normal tubes that were found to harbor microscopic cancers There was no significant increase in the number of grossly occult cancers detected after the policy change and 5 71 of the 7 grossly occult cancers were in the representatively sampled group Approximately 3.76 more blocks per patient were required for total overrepresentative processing and the total cost of these additional sections was estimated to be 25.57 per patient In conclusion the 1.6 to 2.7 of grossly normal adnexa that proved to be cancerous represents at least theoretically the risk for misdiagnosis and understaging that is associated with representative sampling at relatively modest savings However the findings in this study do not provide direct evidentiary support for routine complete processing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[799, 1, 3, 3631, 2, 15, 2330, 20, 35, 12, 16, 2052, 84, 505, 93, 408, 26, 16, 104, 1, 3, 2406, 9, 249, 56, 3, 738, 194, 317, 3, 1311, 2984, 451, 1, 3, 6462, 2285, 4, 26, 546, 257, 40, 1, 3, 1797, 2360, 15, 1, 3724, 3013, 3830, 2, 1198, 11, 446, 9, 3263, 935, 7, 54, 208, 8, 632, 5690, 3470, 5286, 7262, 5376, 6193, 9, 134, 5623, 3, 45, 727, 9226, 3, 3338, 348, 2, 50, 35, 1115, 4196, 707, 29, 29272, 2117, 3724, 6462, 2874, 6, 23107, 181, 3325, 2493, 294, 2, 3167, 7262, 2, 937, 2, 4002, 6193, 11, 6848, 2, 47457, 5232, 106, 871, 198, 75, 3, 96, 26834, 2470, 1, 1789, 3698, 2470, 5, 3, 1076, 485, 2, 2101, 1121, 9, 7187, 557, 12, 21, 1234, 108, 39, 1, 4647, 18, 67, 7185, 295, 7262, 2, 27, 1, 5568, 14, 49, 7185, 295, 6193, 17, 11, 204, 6, 2760, 2984, 163, 125, 10, 77, 93, 344, 4, 3, 207, 1, 7185, 2879, 163, 530, 50, 3, 4196, 707, 2, 33, 792, 1, 3, 67, 7185, 2879, 163, 11, 4, 3, 47457, 5919, 87, 705, 27, 846, 80, 2860, 379, 69, 11, 616, 9, 181, 62038, 3325, 2, 3, 181, 835, 1, 46, 402, 3013, 10, 661, 6, 40, 243, 696, 379, 69, 4, 1221, 3, 14, 49, 6, 18, 67, 1, 7185, 295, 17778, 17, 4328, 6, 40, 5483, 1449, 28, 506, 9662, 3, 43, 9, 13470, 2, 18228, 17, 16, 41, 5, 3724, 2874, 28, 1352, 1721, 7003, 137, 3, 272, 4, 26, 45, 1022, 44, 377, 1196, 19488, 538, 9, 1311, 236, 3325]",1796.0,"['involvement', 'ovary', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'endometrial', 'uncommon', 'clinically', 'significant', 'indication', 'adjuvant', 'chemotherapy', 'evaluated', 'routine', 'microscopic', 'evaluation', 'adnexal', 'organ', 'setting', 'entire', 'specimen', 'representative', 'section', 'slide', 'report', 'reviewed', 'consecutive', 'patient', 'underwent', 'staging', 'salpingo', 'oophorectomy', 'ovary', 'tube', 'endometrial', 'carcinoma', 'carcinosarcoma', 'period', 'encompassed', 'period', 'institutional', 'policy', 'change', 'discretionary', 'predominantly', 'representative', 'adnexal', 'sampling', 'obligatory', 'total', 'processing', 'ninety', 'ovary', 'tube', 'entirely', 'processed', 'respectively', 'expansive', 'definition', 'ovarian', 'gross', 'abnormality', 'definition', 'highest', 'sensitivity', 'lowest', 'specificity', 'microscopically', 'confirmed', 'identified', 'grossly', 'normal', 'ovary', 'grossly', 'normal', 'tube', 'harbor', 'microscopic', 'wa', 'significant', 'increase', 'number', 'grossly', 'occult', 'detected', 'policy', 'change', 'grossly', 'occult', 'sampled', 'group', 'approximately', 'block', 'patient', 'required', 'total', 'processing', 'total', 'cost', 'additional', 'section', 'wa', 'estimated', 'patient', 'grossly', 'normal', 'adnexa', 'proved', 'cancerous', 'represents', 'theoretically', 'risk', 'misdiagnosis', 'understaging', 'associated', 'representative', 'sampling', 'relatively', 'modest', 'saving', 'finding', 'provide', 'direct', 'evidentiary', 'support', 'routine', 'complete', 'processing']",23084582,3,0.01744186046511628
Tumoral displacement into fallopian tubes in patients undergoing robotically assisted hysterectomy for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer.,International journal of gynecological pathology : official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists,Int. J. Gynecol. Pathol.,2013-03-01,"Robotic surgery is increasingly being performed for endometrial cancer. Robotic hysterectomies (RH), like traditional laparoscopic hysterectomies (LH), involve a significant amount of uterine manipulation. The use of a manipulator is thought to possibly increase the incidence of artifactual tumor displacement beyond the endometrium, including the fallopian tube. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between RH and tumor present in the fallopian tube lumina. All RH and LH cases performed for endometrial cancer from May 2007 to August 2009 were reviewed. Of the cases not converted to laparotomy, 137 RH and 184 LH were identified. Age, body mass index, operative and hysterectomy time, type and grade of tumor, stage, pelvic wash results, and the presence of detached tumor fragments (contaminants) in the lumina of the fallopian tubes were recorded. Appropriate statistical tests were applied. Of the 184 LH, 4 (2.2%) were reported to have detached fragments of tumor in the lumina of the fallopian tubes compared with 16 of the 137 (11.7%) RH cases (P<0.001). The majority of the patients with RH and tumor present in the tubes had Stage I disease (9/16, 56.2%) and Grade 1 tumors (9/16, 56.2%). Four (4/16, 25%) patients had Stage IIIa disease detected by a pelvic wash. Patients with contaminants had a higher body mass index, but the difference was not statistically significant and was possibly due to small numbers.

Farletuzumab (a monoclonal antibody against folate receptor alpha) in relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-03-06,"Farletuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to folate receptor-α, which is over-expressed in most epithelial ovarian cancers but largely absent on normal tissue. We evaluated clinical activity of farletuzumab, alone and combined with chemotherapy, in women with first-relapse, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. Fifty-four eligible subjects received open-label farletuzumab weekly, single agent or combined with carboplatin (AUC5-6) and taxane (paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2)), every 21 days for 6 cycles, followed by farletuzumab maintenance until progression. Twenty-eight subjects with asymptomatic CA125 relapse received single-agent farletuzumab and could receive platinum/taxane chemotherapy plus farletuzumab after single-agent progression. Twenty-six subjects with symptomatic relapse entered the combination arm directly; 21 subjects entered after single agent. Primary endpoints included normalized CA125 and Overall Response Rate (ORR). Duration of each subject's second progression-free interval (PFI2) was compared with her own first response interval (PFI1). Farletuzumab was well-tolerated as single agent, without additive toxicity when administered with chemotherapy. Of 47 subjects who received farletuzumab with chemotherapy, 38 (80.9%) normalized CA125. In 9/42 (21%) evaluable subjects, PFI2 was≥PFI1, better than the historical rate (3%). There was a high response rate among subjects with PFI1 <12 months (75%), comparable to that in subjects with PFI1 ≥12 months (84%). Complete or partial ORR was 75% with combination therapy.

Validating the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) for use in patients with ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-05-15,"The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) captures the severity of common cancer symptoms from the patient's perspective. We describe the validity and sensitivity of a module of the MDASI to be used with patients having ovarian cancer (MDASI-OC). Ovarian cancer-specific module items were developed from 14 qualitative patient interviews. 128 patients with invasive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian-tube cancer treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were recruited. Patients completed the MDASI-OC, socio-demographic questionnaires, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovary (FACT-O), and a global quality-of-life (QOL) item. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach α, and sensitivity using a known group was assessed. Construct validity was tested using exploratory factor analysis. The sample was primarily white (85.2%), had a mean age of 57.5 years (±12.7 years), and had previously been treated with chemotherapy (75.0%) and/or surgery (93.8%). Approximately 30% of patients reported disturbed sleep, fatigue, or numbness/tingling of at least moderate severity (≥5 on a 0-10 scale). On the ovarian-cancer-specific symptoms, approximately 20% reported back pain, feeling bloated, or constipation of at least moderate severity. Factor analysis revealed six underlying constructs (pain/sleep; cognitive; disease-related and numbness; treatment-related; affective; gastrointestinal-specific). MDASI-OC symptom and interference items had Cronbach α values of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. The MDASI-OC was sensitive to symptom severity by performance status (p=0.009), QOL (p=0.002), and FACT-O scores (p<0.001).

Intraoperative hypothermia during primary surgical cytoreduction for advanced ovarian cancer: risk factors and associations with postoperative morbidity.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-09-07,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors and potential morbidity associated with intraoperative hypothermia (IH) during cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for advanced ovarian cancer. Demographic and perioperative data were collected for all patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal carcinoma who underwent primary CRS at our institution from 2001 to 2010. Only patients with carcinomatosis and/or bulky upper abdominal disease and residual disease of <1cm were included. Intraoperative hypothermia was defined as temperature of <36.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Associations with 21 perioperative factors, 12 systems-based complications, and specific complications including but not limited to venous thromboembolism and surgical site infection were evaluated. Two hundred ninety-seven patients met the inclusion criteria.

Secretory cell expansion with aging: risk for pelvic serous carcinogenesis.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2013-09-20,"Recent advances suggest that precancerous lesions of pelvic serous carcinoma (PSC) originate from tubal secretory cells. The purpose of our study was to determine if increased number of secretory cells shows difference in age and location and to examine their association with serous neoplasia. Three groups (benign control, high-risk, and PSC) of patients with matched ages were studied. The age data was stratified into 10-year intervals ranging from age 20 to older than 80. The number of secretory and ciliated cells from both tubal fimbria and ampulla segments was counted by microscopy and immunohistochemical staining methods. The data was analyzed by standard contingency table and Poisson distribution methods after age justification. We found that the absolute number of tubal secretory cells increased significantly with age within each age group. Age remained a significant risk factor for serous neoplasia after age adjustment. In addition, a dramatic increase of secretory cells was observed in high-risk and PSC patients. Further, secretory cell expansion (SCE) was more prevalent than secretory cell outgrowth in both fimbria and ampulla tubal segments and was significantly associated with serous neoplasia (p<0.001). These findings suggest that SCE could potentially serve as a sensitive biomarker for early serous carcinogenesis within the fallopian tube. Findings support a relationship between serous neoplasia and increased secretory to ciliated cell ratios. Findings also support a relationship between frequency of SCE and increasing age, presence of high-risk factors and co-existing serous cancers.",Journal Article,2314.0,17.0,Recent advances suggest that precancerous lesions of pelvic serous carcinoma PSC originate from tubal secretory cells The purpose of our study was to determine if increased number of secretory cells shows difference in age and location and to examine their association with serous neoplasia Three groups benign control high-risk and PSC of patients with matched ages were studied The age data was stratified into 10-year intervals ranging from age 20 to older than 80 The number of secretory and ciliated cells from both tubal fimbria and ampulla segments was counted by microscopy and immunohistochemical staining methods The data was analyzed by standard contingency table and Poisson distribution methods after age justification We found that the absolute number of tubal secretory cells increased significantly with age within each age group Age remained a significant risk factor for serous neoplasia after age adjustment In addition a dramatic increase of secretory cells was observed in high-risk and PSC patients Further secretory cell expansion SCE was more prevalent than secretory cell outgrowth in both fimbria and ampulla tubal segments and was significantly associated with serous neoplasia p 0.001 These findings suggest that SCE could potentially serve as a sensitive biomarker for early serous carcinogenesis within the tube Findings support a relationship between serous neoplasia and increased secretory to ciliated cell ratios Findings also support a relationship between frequency of SCE and increasing age presence of high-risk factors and co-existing serous cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[435, 954, 309, 17, 6605, 406, 1, 1110, 1744, 134, 5417, 8838, 29, 6674, 7106, 37, 3, 743, 1, 114, 45, 10, 6, 223, 492, 101, 207, 1, 7106, 37, 1949, 523, 4, 89, 2, 1147, 2, 6, 1004, 136, 248, 5, 1744, 2298, 169, 271, 1002, 182, 64, 43, 2, 5417, 1, 7, 5, 655, 2165, 11, 656, 3, 89, 74, 10, 1173, 237, 79, 111, 1582, 2223, 29, 89, 179, 6, 434, 76, 493, 3, 207, 1, 7106, 2, 21664, 37, 29, 110, 6674, 25257, 2, 12837, 5138, 10, 12252, 20, 3804, 2, 1382, 1029, 636, 3, 74, 10, 311, 20, 260, 30361, 7016, 2, 7668, 1395, 636, 50, 89, 12611, 21, 204, 17, 3, 1766, 207, 1, 6674, 7106, 37, 101, 97, 5, 89, 262, 296, 89, 87, 89, 958, 8, 93, 43, 161, 9, 1744, 2298, 50, 89, 1852, 4, 352, 8, 3079, 344, 1, 7106, 37, 10, 164, 4, 64, 43, 2, 5417, 7, 195, 7106, 31, 1422, 40489, 10, 80, 2485, 76, 7106, 31, 7201, 4, 110, 25257, 2, 12837, 6674, 5138, 2, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1744, 2298, 19, 13, 144, 46, 272, 309, 17, 40489, 359, 751, 1833, 22, 8, 745, 901, 9, 191, 1744, 1719, 262, 3, 2330, 272, 538, 8, 858, 59, 1744, 2298, 2, 101, 7106, 6, 21664, 31, 1137, 272, 120, 538, 8, 858, 59, 675, 1, 40489, 2, 602, 89, 463, 1, 64, 43, 130, 2, 1269, 1692, 1744, 163]",1588.0,"['recent', 'advance', 'suggest', 'precancerous', 'lesion', 'pelvic', 'serous', 'carcinoma', 'psc', 'originate', 'tubal', 'secretory', 'purpose', 'wa', 'determine', 'increased', 'number', 'secretory', 'difference', 'age', 'location', 'examine', 'association', 'serous', 'neoplasia', 'group', 'benign', 'control', 'high', 'risk', 'psc', 'patient', 'matched', 'age', 'studied', 'age', 'wa', 'stratified', 'year', 'interval', 'ranging', 'age', 'older', 'number', 'secretory', 'ciliated', 'tubal', 'fimbria', 'ampulla', 'segment', 'wa', 'counted', 'microscopy', 'staining', 'wa', 'standard', 'contingency', 'poisson', 'distribution', 'age', 'justification', 'absolute', 'number', 'tubal', 'secretory', 'increased', 'significantly', 'age', 'age', 'group', 'age', 'remained', 'significant', 'risk', 'factor', 'serous', 'neoplasia', 'age', 'adjustment', 'addition', 'dramatic', 'increase', 'secretory', 'wa', 'observed', 'high', 'risk', 'psc', 'patient', 'secretory', 'expansion', 'sce', 'wa', 'prevalent', 'secretory', 'outgrowth', 'fimbria', 'ampulla', 'tubal', 'segment', 'wa', 'significantly', 'associated', 'serous', 'neoplasia', 'finding', 'suggest', 'sce', 'potentially', 'serve', 'sensitive', 'biomarker', 'early', 'serous', 'carcinogenesis', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'finding', 'support', 'relationship', 'serous', 'neoplasia', 'increased', 'secretory', 'ciliated', 'ratio', 'finding', 'support', 'relationship', 'frequency', 'sce', 'increasing', 'age', 'presence', 'high', 'risk', 'factor', 'existing', 'serous']",24060413,24,0.13953488372093023
"Intravenous aflibercept in patients with platinum-resistant, advanced ovarian cancer: results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2, parallel-arm study.",Cancer,Cancer,2013-10-11,"In this randomized phase 2 study, the authors assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous aflibercept at 2 different doses (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who developed disease progression after receiving topotecan and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous aflibercept at a dose of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks until they developed disease progression or significant toxicity. The primary endpoint was to evaluate Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor response rates (overall response rate [ORR] = complete responses plus partial responses) and to test the null hypothesis (ORR, >5%). Secondary endpoints included time to tumor progression, safety, progression-free survival/overall survival, drug pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. In total, 67 evaluable patients per cohort were planned based on a Simon 2-stage design, and, if those patients responded, then enrollment could extend to 200 patients. Tumor radiographic response was assessed by investigators and by an independent review committee. After the first 84 evaluable patients, 8 unconfirmed partial responders were noted (ORR, 10%) across both arms; the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended continuing blinded accrual. At study completion, 215 evaluable patients were accrued, including 1 responder of 106 patients (0.9%) in the 2-mg/kg cohort and 5 responders of 109 patients (4.6%) in the 4-mg/kg cohort according to the independent review committee. The clinical benefit rate (ORR plus stable disease >6 months) was 12.3% and 11% in the 2-mg/kg and 4-mg/kg cohorts, respectively.

Identification of ribonucleotide reductase M2 as a potential target for pro-senescence therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",Cell Cycle,2013-10-29,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecological-related cancer deaths in the United States. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease. Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell growth arrest that acts as an important tumor suppression mechanism. Ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) plays a key role in regulating the senescence-associated cell growth arrest by controlling biogenesis of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates (dNTPs). The role of RRM2 in EOC remains poorly understood. Here we show that RRM2 is expressed at higher levels in EOCs compared with either normal ovarian surface epithelium (P<0.001) or fallopian tube epithelium (P<0.001). RRM2 expression significantly correlates with the expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation (P<0.001). Moreover, RRM2 expression positively correlates with tumor grade and stage, and high RRM2 expression independently predicts a shorter overall survival in EOC patients (P<0.001). To delineate the functional role of RRM2 in EOC, we knocked down RRM2 expression in a panel of EOC cell lines. Knockdown of RRM2 expression inhibits the growth of human EOC cells. Mechanistically, RRM2 knockdown triggers cellular senescence in these cells. Notably, this correlates with the induction of the DNA damage response, a known mediator of cellular senescence. These data suggest that targeting RRM2 in EOCs by suppressing its activity is a novel pro-senescence therapeutic strategy that has the potential to improve survival of EOC patients.

Women were eligible for treatment with rilotumumab if they had measurable disease, a performance status of 0, 1 or 2, previously received platinum-based therapy with a progression-free interval of <12 months or a second recurrence, and adequate bone marrow and organ function. Patients received rilotumumab 20mg/kg IV every 14 days until evidence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The study utilized co-dual primary endpoints of tumor response and six-month PFS to assess the efficacy of rilotumumab. Secondary endpoints included the frequency and severity of adverse events and the duration of progression-free and overall survival. Thirty-one women enrolled and received rilotumumab. All were eligible for analysis. One patient achieved a complete response (3.2%; 90% CI 0.2-14%), and two women had 6-month PFS (6.5%; 90% CI 1.1-19%). Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2, with no grade 4 adverse events. Grade 3 adverse events were gastrointestinal (4), metabolic (3) anemia (3), a thromboembolic event (1), ventricular tachycardia (1), hypotension during infusion (1) and fatigue (1).

Tumorgrafts as in vivo surrogates for women with ovarian cancer.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2014-01-07,"Ovarian cancer has a high recurrence and mortality rate. A barrier to improved outcomes includes a lack of accurate models for preclinical testing of novel therapeutics. Clinically relevant, patient-derived tumorgraft models were generated from sequential patients and the first 168 engrafted models are described. Fresh ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinomas were collected at the time of debulking surgery and injected intraperitoneally into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumorgrafts demonstrated a 74% engraftment rate with microscopic fidelity of primary tumor characteristics.

Eligible patients (stage IB-IV) were treated with 6 cycles of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m(2)), docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 3 weeks, followed by single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks to complete one year of therapy. The primary endpoint was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 132 patients (80 with measurable disease at baseline; 52 with non-measurable, evaluable disease at baseline) enrolled and received study treatment. At diagnosis, 76.5% of patients had stage III disease and 20% had stage IV. 62.9% were optimally cytoreduced. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (42.4%), leukopenia (13.6%), hypertension (8.3%), fatigue (6.1%), and nausea (6.1%). One patient (0.8%) had a fatal gastrointestinal perforation. The best overall confirmed response rate (complete response+partial response [measurable disease subgroup]) was 58.6% (95% CI 49%, 67%).

Cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.,"Women's health (London, England)",Womens Health (Lond),2014-03-01,"The amount of the largest diameter of visible residual tumor after cytoreductive surgery remains one of the strongest prognostic factors in advanced ovarian cancer. The implementation of a more aggressive surgical approach to increase the proportion of patients without visible residual tumor is, therefore, a rational concept. Thus, the surgical management of advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers now incorporates more comprehensive surgical procedures. However, these more extensive surgical procedures are associated with an increased risk of morbidity, which may have a negative impact on the oncologic outcome. In addition, it is unclear whether all patients benefit from a comprehensive surgical intervention in the same way or if there are patients whose disease course will not be influenced by this approach. The methodologic analysis of surgical effectiveness is complex and controversial owing to a lack of prospective surgical trials. This review acknowledges controversies and aims to discuss novel developments in the field of cytoreductive surgery for patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers.

"Randomized phase II trial of sorafenib alone or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in women with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.",Investigational new drugs,Invest New Drugs,2014-03-12,"This study was designed to evaluate the response and toxicity of sorafenib alone or when combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC). Patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC with no more than 2 prior courses of chemotherapy were randomized to single-agent sorafenib 400 mg twice daily or combination sorafenib 400 mg bid (days 2-19) with IV carboplatin (AUC 6) and IV paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) (S+C/T) every 3 weeks. Single agent sorafenib could cross over to combination upon progression. Patients were initially randomized to either arm, however, due to poor accrual, sorafenib arm was prematurely closed. A total of 13 patients were evaluable for response to sorafenib and 23 patients were evaluable for response to S+C/T. Objective response rate (RR) was 15 % for patients on sorafenib vs. 61 % for patients on S+C/T (p = 0.014); stable disease was seen in 62 % and 35 %, respectively. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 4 months (mos.) was 69 % for S and 65 % for S+C/T. The median progression free survival was 5.6 months on sorafenib vs. 16.8 months on S+C/T (p = 0.012) and there was no significant difference of overall survival between two arms (p = 0.974) with median overall survival 25.6 months under sorafenib vs. 25.9 months on S+C/T. Patients remained on trial for a median of 7.8 cycles on sorafenib and 5.4 cycles on S+C/T. Sorafenib, alone or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, has activity in patients with platinum-sensitive EOC.

Simultaneous multiplane imaging of human ovarian cancer by volume holographic imaging.,Journal of biomedical optics,J Biomed Opt,2014-03-01,"Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecologic cancer, a fact which is attributable to poor early detection and survival once the disease has reached advanced stages. Intraoperative laparoscopic volume holographic imaging has the potential to provide simultaneous visualization of surface and subsurface structures in ovarian tissues for improved assessment of developing ovarian cancer. In this ex vivo ovarian tissue study, we assembled a benchtop volume holographic imaging system (VHIS) to characterize the microarchitecture of 78 normal and 40 abnormal tissue specimens derived from ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, and peritoneal tissues, collected from 26 patients aged 22 to 73 undergoing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or abdominal cytoreductive surgery. All tissues were successfully imaged with the VHIS in both reflectance- and fluorescence-modes revealing morphological features which can be used to distinguish between normal, benign abnormalities, and cancerous tissues. We present the development and successful application of VHIS for imaging human ovarian tissue. Comparison of VHIS images with corresponding histopathology allowed for qualitatively distinguishing microstructural features unique to the studied tissue type and disease state.

What is the optimal treatment for obese patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma?,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.,2014-04-01,"The purpose of this study was to compare primary debulking surgery (PDS) vs neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS) among obese patients. Medical records of patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m(2) with ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma between January 2005 and December 2010 were reviewed. Patients were separated by PDS or NACT-IDS. Preoperative characteristics, surgical procedures, and postoperative and oncologic outcomes were compared. Of 117 patients, 95 women (81.2%) underwent PDS, and 22 women (18.8%) underwent NACT-IDS. Patients who underwent NACT-IDS were more likely to have stage IV disease (63.6% vs 26.3%; P = .001) and a low surgical complexity score (n = 14; 63.6%). There were no other differences between groups with respect to preoperative characteristics or postoperative morbidity. Compared with the NACT-IDS group, the PDS group had an improved progression-free survival (PFS; 15 vs 11 months; P = .006) and overall survival (OS; 53 vs 32 months; P = .036). Seventy-eight patients (66.7%) had a BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m(2). Within this subset of obese patients, the PDS group had an improved PFS (15 vs 10 months; P = .011) and OS (58 vs 32 months; P = .033), compared with the NACT-IDS group. Among patients with a BMI of ≥35 kg/m(2), there was no difference in PFS (14 vs 12 months; P = .316) or OS (38 vs 32 months; P = .640) when the PDS and NACT-IDS groups were compared.

Key clinical questions to be addressed in this evidence-based guideline on endometrial cancer were identified. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify studies that included no adjuvant therapy, or pelvic radiation or vaginal brachytherapy with or without systemic chemotherapy. Outcomes included local control, survival rates, and overall assessment of quality of life. Patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with either no invasion or <50% myometrial invasion (MI), especially when no other high risk features are present, can be safely observed after hysterectomy. Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence for patients with grade 1 or 2 cancers with ≥50% MI or grade 3 tumors with <50% MI. Patients with grade 3 cancer with ≥50% MI or cervical stroma invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence. There is limited evidence for a benefit to vaginal cuff brachytherapy following pelvic radiation.

Flutamide and biomarkers in women at high risk for ovarian cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2014-06-20,"We hypothesized that (i) preclinical biologic evidence exists for the role of androgens in ovarian cancer development and (ii) flutamide treatment of women at high risk for ovarian cancer may identify meaningful tissue biomarkers of androgen action and of ovarian cancer initiation. We showed that androgen ablation of male mice led to a 24-fold decrease in tumor burden from serous ovarian cells. In a phase II study, we studied the effect of preoperative flutamide treatment (125 mg/day × 6 weeks) in 12 women versus 47 controls, 47% with BRCA mutation. We analyzed immunohistochemical scores of candidate proteins CSF-1, CSF-1R, and ErbB4 in the epithelium and stroma of fallopian tube, ovary, and ovarian endosalpingiosis. Flutamide decreased the levels, notably, of CSF-1 and ErbB4 in ovarian stroma (P ≤ 0.0006) and ovarian endosalpingiosis (P ≤ 0.01), ErbB4 in ovarian epithelium (P = 0.006), and CSF-1R in ovarian endosalpingiosis (P = 0.009). Our logistic regression model clearly distinguished the flutamide patients from controls (P ≤ 0.0001). Our analysis of the precision of this model of CSF-1 and ErbB4 expression in ovarian stroma achieved 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity (AUC = 0.99). Thus, our data suggest that a short 6-week exposure of flutamide reversed elevated levels of CSF-1 and ErbB4 (both of which we had previously found correlated with high risk status). CSF-1 and ErbB4 in ovarian stroma led to a model with high predictive value for flutamide sensitivity. The effect of flutamide on marker expression in ovarian endosalpingiosis, previously associated with BRCA carrier status, suggests that ovarian endosalpingiosis may be a latent precursor to pelvic serous cancers.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2041.0,7.0,We hypothesized that i preclinical biologic evidence exists for the role of androgens in cancer development and ii flutamide treatment of women at high risk for cancer may identify meaningful tissue biomarkers of androgen action and of cancer initiation We showed that androgen ablation of male mice led to a 24-fold decrease in tumor burden from serous cells In a phase II study we studied the effect of preoperative flutamide treatment 125 mg/day 6 weeks in 12 women versus 47 controls 47 with BRCA mutation We analyzed immunohistochemical scores of candidate proteins CSF-1 CSF-1R and ErbB4 in the epithelium and stroma of tube ovary and endosalpingiosis Flutamide decreased the levels notably of CSF-1 and ErbB4 in stroma P ≤ 0.0006 and endosalpingiosis P ≤ 0.01 ErbB4 in epithelium P 0.006 and CSF-1R in endosalpingiosis P 0.009 Our logistic regression model clearly distinguished the flutamide patients from controls P ≤ 0.0001 Our analysis of the precision of this model of CSF-1 and ErbB4 expression in stroma achieved 100 sensitivity and 97 specificity AUC 0.99 Thus our data suggest that a short 6-week exposure of flutamide reversed elevated levels of CSF-1 and ErbB4 both of which we had previously found correlated with high risk status CSF-1 and ErbB4 in stroma led to a model with high predictive value for flutamide sensitivity The effect of flutamide on marker expression in endosalpingiosis previously associated with BRCA carrier status suggests that endosalpingiosis may be a latent precursor to pelvic serous cancers,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 1237, 17, 70, 693, 1283, 241, 2481, 9, 3, 200, 1, 5488, 4, 12, 193, 2, 215, 11115, 24, 1, 117, 28, 64, 43, 9, 12, 68, 255, 2538, 246, 582, 1, 687, 1578, 2, 1, 12, 1118, 21, 224, 17, 687, 1650, 1, 1045, 399, 836, 6, 8, 259, 1116, 775, 4, 30, 892, 29, 1744, 37, 4, 8, 124, 215, 45, 21, 656, 3, 254, 1, 498, 11115, 24, 1731, 81, 218, 49, 244, 4, 133, 117, 185, 662, 535, 662, 5, 1555, 258, 21, 311, 1382, 703, 1, 1609, 652, 1211, 14, 1211, 2994, 2, 12750, 4, 3, 2781, 2, 2477, 1, 2330, 3631, 2, 27072, 11115, 340, 3, 148, 2552, 1, 1211, 14, 2, 12750, 4, 2477, 19, 1552, 13, 6013, 2, 27072, 19, 1552, 13, 355, 12750, 4, 2781, 19, 13, 1861, 2, 1211, 2994, 4, 27072, 19, 13, 2376, 114, 812, 320, 202, 2536, 4735, 3, 11115, 7, 29, 535, 19, 1552, 13, 488, 114, 65, 1, 3, 2720, 1, 26, 202, 1, 1211, 14, 2, 12750, 55, 4, 2477, 513, 394, 485, 2, 1015, 1121, 1376, 13, 1058, 631, 114, 74, 309, 17, 8, 978, 49, 647, 645, 1, 11115, 3682, 804, 148, 1, 1211, 14, 2, 12750, 110, 1, 92, 21, 42, 373, 204, 438, 5, 64, 43, 156, 1211, 14, 2, 12750, 4, 2477, 836, 6, 8, 202, 5, 64, 464, 549, 9, 11115, 485, 3, 254, 1, 11115, 23, 952, 55, 4, 27072, 373, 41, 5, 1555, 4715, 156, 844, 17, 27072, 68, 40, 8, 6011, 2765, 6, 1110, 1744, 163]",1537.0,"['hypothesized', 'preclinical', 'biologic', 'evidence', 'exists', 'role', 'androgen', 'ovarian', 'development', 'ii', 'flutamide', 'treatment', 'woman', 'high', 'risk', 'ovarian', 'identify', 'meaningful', 'tissue', 'biomarkers', 'androgen', 'action', 'ovarian', 'initiation', 'showed', 'androgen', 'ablation', 'male', 'mouse', 'led', 'fold', 'decrease', 'burden', 'serous', 'ovarian', 'phase', 'ii', 'studied', 'effect', 'preoperative', 'flutamide', 'treatment', 'mg', 'day', 'week', 'woman', 'versus', 'control', 'brca', 'score', 'candidate', 'csf', 'csf', 'erbb', 'epithelium', 'stroma', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'ovary', 'ovarian', 'flutamide', 'decreased', 'level', 'notably', 'csf', 'erbb', 'ovarian', 'stroma', 'ovarian', 'erbb', 'ovarian', 'epithelium', 'csf', 'ovarian', 'logistic', 'regression', 'model', 'clearly', 'distinguished', 'flutamide', 'patient', 'control', 'precision', 'model', 'csf', 'erbb', 'expression', 'ovarian', 'stroma', 'achieved', 'sensitivity', 'specificity', 'auc', 'suggest', 'short', 'week', 'exposure', 'flutamide', 'reversed', 'elevated', 'level', 'csf', 'erbb', 'previously', 'correlated', 'high', 'risk', 'status', 'csf', 'erbb', 'ovarian', 'stroma', 'led', 'model', 'high', 'predictive', 'value', 'flutamide', 'sensitivity', 'effect', 'flutamide', 'marker', 'expression', 'ovarian', 'previously', 'associated', 'brca', 'carrier', 'status', 'suggests', 'ovarian', 'latent', 'precursor', 'pelvic', 'serous']",24950779,99,0.5755813953488372
"A phase II study of ramucirumab (IMC-1121B) in the treatment of persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-07-10,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-mediated signaling contributes to ovarian cancer pathogenesis. Elevated VEGF expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We investigated ramucirumab, a fully human anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, in patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Women who received ≥ 1 platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen and had a platinum-free interval of <12 months with measurable disease were eligible. Patients received 8 mg/kg ramucirumab intravenously every 2 weeks. Sixty patients were treated; one patient remained on study as of September 2013. The median age was 62 years (range: 27-80), and median number of prior regimens was 3. Forty-five (75%) patients had platinum refractory/resistant disease. Thirty-nine patients (65.0%) had serous tumors. PFS-6 was 25.0% (n=15/60, 95% CI: 14.7-37.9%). Best overall response was: partial response 5.0% (n=3/60), stable disease 56.7% (n=34/60), and progressive disease 33.3% (n=20/60). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events possibly related to study drug were headache (65.0%; 10.0% Grade ≥ 3), fatigue (56.7%; 3.3% Grade ≥ 3), diarrhea (28.3%; 1.7% Grade ≥ 3), hypertension (25.0%; 3.3% Grade ≥ 3), and nausea (20.0%; no Grade ≥ 3).

Oncol.,2014-07-11,"To assess the ability of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and serum CA-125 to predict suboptimal (>1cm residual disease) primary cytoreduction in advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. This was a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter trial of patients who underwent primary cytoreduction for stage III-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis and serum CA-125 were obtained within 35 and 14 days before surgery, respectively. Four clinical and 20 radiologic criteria were assessed. From 7/2001 to 12/2012, 669 patients were enrolled; 350 met eligibility criteria. The optimal debulking rate was 75%. On multivariate analysis, three clinical and six radiologic criteria were significantly associated with suboptimal debulking: age ≥ 60 years (p=0.01); CA-125 ≥ 500 U/mL (p<0.001); ASA 3-4 (p<0.001); suprarenal retroperitoneal lymph nodes >1cm (p<0.001); diffuse small bowel adhesions/thickening (p<0.001); and lesions >1cm in the small bowel mesentery (p=0.03), root of the superior mesenteric artery (p=0.003), perisplenic area (p<0.001), and lesser sac (p<0.001). A 'predictive value score' was assigned for each criterion, and the suboptimal debulking rates of patients who had a total score of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and ≥ 9 were 5%, 10%, 17%, 34%, 52%, and 74%, respectively.

Analysis of serial ovarian volume measurements and incidence of ovarian cancer: implications for pathogenesis.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2014-09-13,"Accumulating evidence suggests that many ovarian cancers represent metastases from occult fallopian tube carcinomas or tumors arising within ovarian endometriosis. We hypothesized that small ovarian volumes, as reflected in nonvisualization by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), would be a marker of lower ovarian cancer risk, whereas enlargement on serial examinations would indicate higher risk. To address these hypotheses, we analyzed serial ovarian volume measurements determined by TVU for 29321 women (102787 scans) performed in the ovarian cancer screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial. Cox models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of association between TVU results and ovarian cancer. We assessed whether increasing ovarian volume preceded diagnosis of ovarian cancer in a nested case-control analysis comparing case patients and control patients matched on age, center, and screening year (1:4 ratio). All statistical tests were two-sided. Visualization of normal-appearing ovaries at the last TVU scan was associated with marginally higher ovarian cancer risk compared with nonvisualization of the ovaries (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.01). Ovarian volume increased statistically significantly in ovarian cancer case patients one to two years before diagnosis (P < .001), but not in matched control patients.

Combination cediranib and olaparib versus olaparib alone for women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer: a randomised phase 2 study.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2014-09-10,"Olaparib is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor and cediranib is an anti-angiogenic agent with activity against VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. Both oral agents have antitumour activity in women with recurrent ovarian cancer, and their combination was active and had manageable toxicities in a phase 1 trial. We investigated whether this combination could improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with olaparib monotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In our randomised, open-label, phase 2 study, we recruited women (aged ≥18 years) who had measurable platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, or those with deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations from nine participating US academic medical centres. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to permuted blocks, stratified by germline BRCA status and previous anti-angiogenic therapy, to receive olaparib capsules 400 mg twice daily or the combination at the recommended phase 2 dose of cediranib 30 mg daily and olaparib capsules 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. The phase 2 trial is no longer accruing patients. An interim analysis was conducted in November, 2013, after 50% of expected events had occurred and efficacy results were unmasked. The primary analysis was performed on March 31, 2014, after 47 events (66% of those expected). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01116648. Between Oct 26, 2011, and June 3, 2013, we randomly allocated 46 women to receive olaparib alone and 44 to receive the combination of olaparib and cediranib. Median PFS was 17·7 months (95% CI 14·7-not reached) for the women treated with cediranib plus olaparib compared with 9·0 months (95% CI 5·7-16·5) for those treated with olaparib monotherapy (hazard ratio 0·42, 95% CI 0·23-0·76; p=0·005). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were more common with combination therapy than with monotherapy, including fatigue (12 patients in the cediranib plus olaparib group vs five patients in the olaparib monotherapy group), diarrhoea (ten vs none), and hypertension (18 vs none). Cediranib plus olaparib seems to improve PFS in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, and warrants study in a phase 3 trial. The side-effect profile suggests such investigations should include assessments of quality of life and patient-reported outcomes to understand the effects of a continuing oral regimen with that of intermittent chemotherapy.

Preclinical and clinical studies support VEGFR and PDGFR as targets for advanced ovarian cancer treatment. This study evaluated the role of pazopanib maintenance therapy in patients with ovarian cancer whose disease did not progress during first-line chemotherapy. Nine hundred forty patients with histologically confirmed cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum, International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics (FIGO) stages II-IV, no evidence of progression after primary therapy consisting of surgery and at least five cycles of platinum-taxane chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive pazopanib 800 mg once per day or placebo for up to 24 months. The primary end point was progression-free survival by RECIST 1.0 assessed by the investigators. Maintenance pazopanib prolonged progression-free survival compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.91; P = .0021; median, 17.9 v 12.3 months, respectively). Interim survival analysis based on events in 35.6% of the population did not show any significant difference. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of hypertension (30.8%), neutropenia (9.9%), liver-related toxicity (9.4%), diarrhea (8.2%), fatigue (2.7%), thrombocytopenia (2.5%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (1.9%) were significantly higher in the pazopanib arm. Treatment discontinuation related to adverse events was higher among patients treated with pazopanib (33.3%) compared with placebo (5.6%). Pazopanib maintenance therapy provided a median improvement of 5.6 months (HR, 0.77) in progression-free survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have not progressed after first-line chemotherapy.

Progression-free survival by local investigator versus independent central review: comparative analysis of the AGO-OVAR16 Trial.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2014-11-28,"Analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint in advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer (AEOC) trials may be confounded by the difficulty of radiologic evaluation of disease progression and the potential for discrepancy between investigator and blinded independent central assessments. PFS as assessed by local investigator (INV) was the primary endpoint of AGO-OVAR16, a randomized, double-blind trial of pazopanib maintenance therapy in AEOC. To confirm the robustness of the primary analysis, PFS was also evaluated by blinded independent central review (BICR). Patients with histologically confirmed AEOC (N = 940) were randomized 1:1 to receive pazopanib 800 mg/day or placebo for up to 24 months. Tumor response in the intent-to-treat population was evaluated by CT/MRI every 6 months and analyzed per RECIST 1.0. Pazopanib prolonged PFS versus placebo by INV (median 17.9 vs 12.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.766, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.643-0.911; P = 0.0021). Results for PFS by BICR were similar (median 15.4 vs 11.8 months; HR = 0.802, 95% CI: 0.678-0.949; P = 0.0084). Progression events were recorded later by INV in 23% of pazopanib-treated patients and 17% of placebo-treated patients. The overall concordance between INV and BICR assessments was 84% and 86% in the pazopanib and placebo arms, respectively. By INV and BICR assessments, maintenance therapy with pazopanib in AEOC provided a significantly longer PFS than placebo. The good overall concordance between INV and BICR assessments, as well as HR and P value consistency, supports the reliability of investigator-assessed PFS as the primary endpoint in AGO-OVAR16.","Clinical Trial, Phase III",1880.0,14.0,Analysis of progression-free survival PFS as the primary endpoint in advanced epithelial tube and primary peritoneal cancer AEOC trials may be confounded by the difficulty of radiologic evaluation of disease progression and the potential for discrepancy between investigator and blinded independent central assessments PFS as assessed by local investigator INV was the primary endpoint of AGO-OVAR16 a randomized double-blind trial of pazopanib maintenance therapy in AEOC To confirm the robustness of the primary analysis PFS was also evaluated by blinded independent central review BICR Patients with histologically confirmed AEOC N 940 were randomized 1:1 to receive pazopanib 800 mg/day or placebo for up to 24 months Tumor response in the intent-to-treat population was evaluated by CT/MRI every 6 months and analyzed per RECIST 1.0 Pazopanib prolonged PFS versus placebo by INV median 17.9 vs 12.3 months hazard ratio HR 0.766 95 confidence interval CI 0.643-0.911 P 0.0021 Results for PFS by BICR were similar median 15.4 vs 11.8 months HR 0.802 95 CI 0.678-0.949 P 0.0084 Progression events were recorded later by INV in 23 of pazopanib-treated patients and 17 of placebo-treated patients The overall concordance between INV and BICR assessments was 84 and 86 in the pazopanib and placebo arms respectively By INV and BICR assessments maintenance therapy with pazopanib in AEOC provided a significantly longer PFS than placebo The good overall concordance between INV and BICR assessments as well as HR and P value consistency supports the reliability of investigator-assessed PFS as the primary endpoint in AGO-OVAR16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[65, 1, 91, 115, 25, 300, 22, 3, 86, 1138, 4, 131, 701, 2330, 2, 86, 1639, 12, 35929, 143, 68, 40, 8927, 20, 3, 4035, 1, 2812, 451, 1, 34, 91, 2, 3, 174, 9, 7916, 59, 3464, 2, 3288, 306, 854, 2182, 300, 22, 275, 20, 293, 3464, 6397, 10, 3, 86, 1138, 1, 5028, 40168, 8, 384, 1627, 3142, 160, 1, 2576, 1146, 36, 4, 35929, 6, 1843, 3, 7031, 1, 3, 86, 65, 300, 10, 120, 194, 20, 3288, 306, 854, 206, 32354, 7, 5, 2161, 557, 35929, 78, 11733, 11, 384, 14, 14, 6, 560, 2576, 2796, 81, 218, 15, 619, 9, 126, 6, 259, 53, 30, 51, 4, 3, 1697, 6, 943, 266, 10, 194, 20, 425, 704, 454, 49, 53, 2, 311, 379, 1834, 14, 13, 2576, 1069, 300, 185, 619, 20, 6397, 52, 269, 83, 105, 133, 27, 53, 360, 197, 168, 13, 15317, 48, 307, 268, 58, 13, 14810, 13, 14252, 19, 13, 15850, 99, 9, 300, 20, 32354, 11, 288, 52, 167, 39, 105, 175, 66, 53, 168, 13, 15135, 48, 58, 13, 14892, 13, 14916, 19, 13, 22283, 91, 281, 11, 1872, 1559, 20, 6397, 4, 382, 1, 2576, 73, 7, 2, 269, 1, 619, 73, 7, 3, 63, 1827, 59, 6397, 2, 32354, 2182, 10, 874, 2, 868, 4, 3, 2576, 2, 619, 1335, 106, 20, 6397, 2, 32354, 2182, 1146, 36, 5, 2576, 4, 35929, 1052, 8, 97, 589, 300, 76, 619, 3, 1178, 63, 1827, 59, 6397, 2, 32354, 2182, 22, 149, 22, 168, 2, 19, 549, 5358, 2304, 3, 4217, 1, 3464, 275, 300, 22, 3, 86, 1138, 4, 5028, 40168]",1626.0,"['progression', 'free', 'survival', 'pfs', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'advanced', 'epithelial', 'ovarian', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'aeoc', 'trial', 'confounded', 'difficulty', 'radiologic', 'evaluation', 'disease', 'progression', 'potential', 'discrepancy', 'investigator', 'blinded', 'independent', 'central', 'assessment', 'pfs', 'assessed', 'local', 'investigator', 'inv', 'wa', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'ago', 'ovar', 'randomized', 'double', 'blind', 'trial', 'pazopanib', 'maintenance', 'therapy', 'aeoc', 'confirm', 'robustness', 'primary', 'pfs', 'wa', 'evaluated', 'blinded', 'independent', 'central', 'review', 'bicr', 'patient', 'histologically', 'confirmed', 'aeoc', 'randomized', 'receive', 'pazopanib', 'mg', 'day', 'placebo', 'month', 'response', 'intent', 'treat', 'population', 'wa', 'evaluated', 'ct', 'mri', 'month', 'recist', 'pazopanib', 'prolonged', 'pfs', 'versus', 'placebo', 'inv', 'median', 'month', 'hazard', 'ratio', 'hr', 'confidence', 'interval', 'ci', 'pfs', 'bicr', 'similar', 'median', 'month', 'hr', 'ci', 'progression', 'event', 'recorded', 'later', 'inv', 'pazopanib', 'treated', 'patient', 'placebo', 'treated', 'patient', 'overall', 'concordance', 'inv', 'bicr', 'assessment', 'wa', 'pazopanib', 'placebo', 'arm', 'respectively', 'inv', 'bicr', 'assessment', 'maintenance', 'therapy', 'pazopanib', 'aeoc', 'provided', 'significantly', 'longer', 'pfs', 'placebo', 'good', 'overall', 'concordance', 'inv', 'bicr', 'assessment', 'hr', 'value', 'consistency', 'support', 'reliability', 'investigator', 'assessed', 'pfs', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'ago', 'ovar']",25434635,4,0.023255813953488372
Detection of somatic TP53 mutations in tampons of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2014-11-01,"To investigate whether tumor cells could be detected in the vagina of women with serous ovarian cancer through TP53 analysis of DNA samples collected by placement of a vaginal tampon. Women undergoing surgery for a pelvic mass were identified in the gynecologic oncology clinic. They placed a vaginal tampon before surgery, which was removed in the operating room. Cells were isolated and DNA was extracted from both the cells trapped within the tampon and the primary tumor. In patients with serous carcinoma, the DNA was interrogated for the presence of TP53 mutations using a method capable of detecting rare mutant alleles in a mixture of mutant and wild-type DNA. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. Eight patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer were included for analysis. Three had a prior tubal ligation. TP53 mutations were identified in all eight tumor samples. Analysis of the DNA from the tampons revealed mutations in three of the five patients with intact tubes (sensitivity 60%) and in none of the three patients with tubal ligation. In all three participants with mutation detected in the tampon specimen, the tumor and the vaginal DNA harbored the exact same TP53 mutation. The fraction of DNA derived from exfoliated tumor cells ranged from 0.01% to 0.07%. In this pilot study, DNA derived from tumor was detected in the vaginas of 60% of patients with ovarian cancer with intact fallopian tubes.

Targeting those with decreased meaning and peace: a supportive care opportunity.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Support Care Cancer,2014-12-18,"To evaluate if an individual's level of meaning/peace (M/P) predicts various quality of life (QOL) and mental well-being measures. To identify targets that might enhance the overall spiritual well-being and QOL of ovarian cancer patients. Multi-site analysis of women with newly diagnosed stages II-IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Patients completed the following surveys: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual (FACIT-Sp), Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS). Linear regression models were created to examine the effect of M/P (FACIT-Sp) upon QOL, symptoms, and other measures of mental well-being. These models adjusted for the effect of site, race, age, stage, anaphylaxis to chemotherapy, and partner status as potential confounders. This study enrolled 104 patients from three separate sites. After adjusting for potential confounders, it was found that higher M/P predicted better QOL (FACT-O) (p < 0.0001).

Elafin is downregulated during breast and ovarian  tumorigenesis but its residual expression predicts  recurrence.,Breast cancer research : BCR,Breast Cancer Res.,2014-01-01,"Elafin is an endogenous serine protease inhibitor. The majority of breast cancer cell lines lack elafin expression compared to human mammary epithelial cells. In this study, we hypothesized that elafin is downregulated during breast and ovarian tumorigenesis. We examined elafin expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in specimens of normal breast tissue (n = 24), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 54), and invasive breast cancer (n = 793). IHC analysis of elafin expression was also performed in normal fallopian tube tissue (n = 20), ovarian cystadenomas (n = 9), borderline ovarian tumors (n = 21), and invasive ovarian carcinomas (n = 216). To understand the significance of elafin in luminal breast cancer cell lines, wild-type or M25G elafin (lacking the protease inhibitory function) were exogenously expressed in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Elafin expression was downregulated in 24% of DCIS and 83% of invasive breast tumors when compared to elafin expression in the normal mammary epithelium. However, the presence of elafin-positive cells in invasive breast tumors, even at low frequency, correlated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), reduced overall survival (OS), and clinicopathological markers of aggressive tumor behavior. Elafin-positive cells were an especially strong and independent prognostic marker of reduced RFS in IHC-defined luminal A-like tumors. Elafin was also downregulated in 33% of ovarian cystadenomas, 43% of borderline ovarian tumors, and 86% of invasive ovarian carcinomas when compared to elafin expression in the normal fallopian tube. In ovarian tumors, elafin-positive cells were correlated with reduced RFS, OS and disease-specific survival (DSS) only in stage I/II patients and not in stage III/IV patients. Notably, exogenous expression of elafin or elafin M25G in the luminal breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D significantly decreased cell proliferation in a protease inhibitory domain-independent manner. Elafin predicts poor outcome in breast and ovarian cancer patients and delineates a subset of endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer patients susceptible to recurrence who could benefit from more aggressive intervention.

Salpingectomy as a means to reduce ovarian cancer risk.,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),2015-01-13,"Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) has become the standard-of-care for risk reduction in women at hereditary risk of ovarian cancer. Although this procedure significantly decreases both the incidence of and mortality from ovarian cancer, it affects quality of life, and the premature cessation of ovarian function may have long-term health hazards. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular pathways of ovarian cancer point to the fallopian tube epithelium as the origin of most high-grade serous cancers (HGSC). This evolving appreciation of the role of the fallopian tube in HGSC has led to the consideration of salpingectomy alone as an option for risk management, especially in premenopausal women. In addition, it is postulated that bilateral salpingectomy with ovarian retention (BSOR), may have a public health benefit for women undergoing benign gynecologic surgery.

"Randomized Trial of Oral Cyclophosphamide and Veliparib in High-Grade Serous Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal, or Fallopian Tube Cancers, or BRCA-Mutant Ovarian Cancer.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2015-01-14,"Veliparib, a PARP inhibitor, demonstrated clinical activity in combination with oral cyclophosphamide in patients with BRCA-mutant solid tumors in a phase I trial. To define the relative contribution of PARP inhibition to the observed clinical activity, we conducted a randomized phase II trial to determine the response rate of veliparib in combination with cyclophosphamide compared with cyclophosphamide alone in patients with pretreated BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer or in patients with pretreated primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, or high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). Adult patients were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide alone (50 mg orally once daily) or with veliparib (60 mg orally once daily) in 21-day cycles. Crossover to the combination was allowed at disease progression. Seventy-five patients were enrolled and 72 were evaluable for response; 38 received cyclophosphamide alone and 37 the combination as their initial treatment regimen. Treatment was well tolerated. One complete response was observed in each arm, with three partial responses (PR) in the combination arm and six PRs in the cyclophosphamide alone arm. Genetic sequence and expression analyses were performed for 211 genes involved in DNA repair; none of the detected genetic alterations were significantly associated with treatment benefit. This is the first trial that evaluated single-agent, low-dose cyclophosphamide in HGSOC, peritoneal, fallopian tube, and BRCA-mutant ovarian cancers.

Cell-type-specific enrichment of risk-associated regulatory elements at ovarian cancer susceptibility loci.,Human molecular genetics,Hum. Mol. Genet.,2015-03-24,"Understanding the regulatory landscape of the human genome is a central question in complex trait genetics. Most single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cancer risk lie in non-protein-coding regions, implicating regulatory DNA elements as functional targets of susceptibility variants. Here, we describe genome-wide annotation of regions of open chromatin and histone modification in fallopian tube and ovarian surface epithelial cells (FTSECs, OSECs), the debated cellular origins of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) and in endometriosis epithelial cells (EECs), the likely precursor of clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCOCs). The regulatory architecture of these cell types was compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We observed similar positional patterns of global enhancer signatures across the three different ovarian cancer precursor cell types, and evidence of tissue-specific regulatory signatures compared to non-gynecological cell types. We found significant enrichment for risk-associated SNPs intersecting regulatory biofeatures at 17 known HGSOC susceptibility loci in FTSECs (P = 3.8 × 10(-30)), OSECs (P = 2.4 × 10(-23)) and HMECs (P = 6.7 × 10(-15)) but not for EECs (P = 0.45) or LNCaP cells (P = 0.88). Hierarchical clustering of risk SNPs conditioned on the six different cell types indicates FTSECs and OSECs are highly related (96% of samples using multi-scale bootstrapping) suggesting both cell types may be precursors of HGSOC. These data represent the first description of regulatory catalogues of normal precursor cells for different ovarian cancer subtypes, and provide unique insights into the tissue specific regulatory variation with respect to the likely functional targets of germline genetic susceptibility variants for ovarian cancer.

Feeling powerless: Locus of control as a potential target for supportive care interventions to increase quality of life and decrease anxiety in ovarian cancer patients.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-05-16,"To evaluate if an individual's locus of control (LOC) predicts various quality of life (QOL) and mental well-being measures. To identify targets that might enhance the overall spiritual well-being and QOL of ovarian cancer patients. Multi-site analysis of women with newly diagnosed stages II-IV ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Patients completed the following surveys: Locus of Control Scale (LOC), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual (FACIT-Sp), Edmonton Symptom Assessment score (ESAS), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), and Herth Hope Index (HHI). Regression models were created to examine the effect of LOC upon QOL, symptoms, and other measures of mental well-being. These models adjusted for the effect of site of care, race, and partnership status as potential confounders. This study enrolled 104 patients from three separate treatment facilities. After adjusting for site, race and partnership status, higher levels of external LOC predicted decreased QOL (FACT-O) (p<0.05). Higher levels of external LOC also correlated with increased death anxiety and general anxiety (p≤0.05). Additionally, higher levels of external LOC predicted decreased hope (HHI) (p≤0.01).

Secondary objectives were safety and pharmacokinetics. In addition, we sought to determine the potential interaction of clinical benefit and patient characteristics. This two-stage, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial enrolled eligible patients to receive hu3S193 weekly at a dose of 20mg/m(2) intravenously for 8 weeks (1 cycle) to a maximum of 3 cycles. Efficacy was measured as clinical benefit rate (objective response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). 26 of 31 patients were eligible for efficacy analysis. No complete/partial responses were observed. Six patients had stable disease for 24+weeks [clinical benefit rate 23% (95% CI=9.77%-46.71%)]. Median PFS was 8.4 weeks (95% CI=6.0 to 16.1). Median PFS differed between patients with no ascites and no visceral disease and patients with ascites and/or visceral disease [16.1 vs. 8.1 weeks (p=0.0058)]. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (19.3%) and nausea (16.2%). Allergic reactions occurred in 6 patients (5 with Grade 1/2; 1 with Grade 3).

Relationships of Tubal Ligation to Endometrial Carcinoma Stage and Mortality in the NRG Oncology/ Gynecologic Oncology Group 210 Trial.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2015-06-18,"Stage is a critical determinant of treatment among endometrial carcinoma patients; understanding patterns of tumor spread may suggest approaches to improve staging. Specifically, the importance of exfoliation of endometrial carcinoma cells through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneum is ill defined. We assessed the hypothesis that tubal ligation (TL), which should impede transtubal passage of cells, is associated with lower endometrial carcinoma stage at presentation and, consequently, lower mortality. The NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 210 Trial included 4489 endometrial carcinoma patients who completed a risk factor questionnaire that included TL history. Pathology data were derived from clinical reports and central review. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between TL with stage and peritoneal metastasis, overall and by tumor subtype. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for TL and mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided. Compared with stage I, TL was inversely associated with stage III (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.78) and stage IV carcinomas (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.24) overall and among individual tumor subtypes. TL was inversely related to peritoneal metastasis overall (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.68) and among serous carcinomas (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.68). In multivariable models unadjusted for stage, TL was associated with lower endometrial carcinoma-specific mortality (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.91); however, adjustment for stage eliminated the survival advantage. Similar relationships with all-cause mortality were observed.

Radical trachelectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: A comparison of laparotomy and minimally invasive surgery.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2015-06-18,"Radical trachelectomy is considered standard of care in patients with early-stage cervical cancer interested in future fertility. The goal of this study was to compare operative, oncologic, and fertility outcomes in patients with early-stage cervical cancer undergoing open vs. minimally invasive radical trachelectomy. A retrospective review was performed of patients from four institutions who underwent radical trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer from June 2002 to July 2013. Perioperative, oncologic, and fertility outcomes were compared between patients undergoing open vs. minimally invasive surgery. A total of 100 patients were included in the analysis. Fifty-eight patients underwent open radical trachelectomy and 42 patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS=laparoscopic or robotic). There were no differences in patient age, body mass index, race, histology, lymph vascular space invasion, or stage between the two groups. The median surgical time for MIS was 272min [range, 130-441min] compared with 270min [range, 150-373min] for open surgery (p=0.78). Blood loss was significantly lower for MIS vs. laparotomy (50mL [range, 10-225mL] vs. 300mL [50-1100mL]) (p<0.0001). Nine patients required blood transfusion, all in the open surgery group (p=0.010). Length of hospitalization was shorter for MIS than for laparotomy (1day [1-3 days] vs. 4days [1-9 days]) (p<0.0001). Three intraoperative complications occurred (3%): 1 bladder injury, and 1 fallopian tube injury requiring unilateral salpingectomy in the MIS group and 1 vascular injury in the open surgery group. The median lymph node count was 17 (range, 5-47) for MIS vs. 22 (range, 7-48) for open surgery (p=0.03). There were no differences in the rate of postoperative complications (30% MIS vs. 31% open surgery). Among 83 patients who preserved their fertility (33 MIS vs. 50 open surgery), 34 (41%) patients attempted to get pregnant. Sixteen (47%) patients were able to do so (MIS: 2 vs. laparotomy: 14, p=0.01). The pregnancy rate was higher in the open surgery group when compared to the MIS group (51% vs. 28%, p=0.018). However, median follow-up was shorter is the MIS group compared with the open surgery group (25months [range, 10-69] vs. 66months [range, 11-147]).

Survivors of gynecologic malignancies: impact of treatment on health and well-being.,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2015-08-06,"While overall survival from gynecologic malignancies has greatly improved over the last three decades, required treatments can lead to multiple health issues for survivors. Our objective was to identify health concerns that gynecologic cancer survivors face. A systematic, stratified sample of women with gynecologic malignancies was surveyed for 18 health issues occurring before, during, or after treatment. The impact of clinical features and treatment modality on health issues was assessed through multivariate logistic regression models. Of 2,546 surveys mailed, 622 were not received by eligible subjects secondary to invalid address, incorrect diagnosis, or death. Thus, 1924 survivors potentially received surveys. Of the 1,029 surveys (53.5%) completed, median age was 59 years; diagnoses included 29% cervical, 26% endometrial, 26% ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube, 12.1% vulvar, and 5.4% vaginal cancers. The most frequently reported health issues included fatigue (60.6%), sleep disturbance (54.9%), urinary difficulties (50.9%), sexual dysfunction (48.4%), neurologic issues (45.4%), bowel complaints (42.0%), depression (41.3%), and memory problems (41.2%). These rankings were consistent with patients' self-reported rankings of ""highest impact"" personal issues. After controlling for demographic and clinical variables, multivariate analyses revealed that treatment modality impacted the odds of experiencing a given health issue. Our study demonstrates that gynecologic cancer survivors experience a high frequency of health conditions and highlights the association between treatment modality and specific health concerns.

Clinical impact of selective and nonselective beta-blockers on survival in patients with ovarian cancer.,Cancer,Cancer,2015-08-24,"Preclinical evidence has suggested that sustained adrenergic activation can promote ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. The authors examined the impact of beta-adrenergic blockade on the clinical outcome of women with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers (collectively, epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC]). A multicenter review of 1425 women with histopathologically confirmed EOC was performed. Comparisons were made between patients with documented beta-blocker use during chemotherapy and those without beta-blocker use. The median age of patients in the current study was 63 years (range, 21-93 years). The sample included 269 patients who received beta-blockers. Of those, 193 (71.7%) were receiving beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents, and the remaining patients were receiving nonselective beta antagonists. The primary indication for beta-blocker use was hypertension but also included arrhythmia and postmyocardial infarction management. For patients receiving any beta-blocker, the median overall survival (OS) was 47.8 months versus 42 months for nonusers (P =.04). The median OS based on beta-blocker receptor selectivity was 94.9 months for those receiving nonselective beta-blockers versus 38 months for those receiving beta-1-adrenergic receptor selective agents (P<.001). Hypertension was associated with decreased OS compared with no hypertension across all groups.

Staging Lymphadenectomy in Patients With Clear Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2016-01-01,"The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of lymph node (LN) metastasis in comprehensively staged ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) clinically confined to the ovary and determine factors associated with LN metastasis. We identified all cases of OCCC treated at 4 institutions from January 1994 through December 2011. We included cases with disease grossly confined to the ovary that had surgical staging performed, including at least 10 LNs sampled. Clinical and pathologic data were abstracted from electronic medical records, and a deidentified data set was compiled and processed at a single institution. Factors potentially associated with LN metastasis were tested. Appropriate statistical tests were performed. We identified 145 eligible cases that met the criteria for this analysis. Median age was 52.9 years (range, 30-81 years), and median total LN count was 19 (range, 10-74). Seven (4.8%) of 145 comprehensively staged cases had LN metastasis; 6 of these cases (4.1%) were isolated metastasis. Cytologic washings, peritoneal, omental, and fallopian tube involvement were not associated with nodal metastasis. Cases with ovarian surface involvement and positive cytology had a 37.5% incidence of LN positivity, which was statistically meaningful when compared with all other cases (P = 0.003). Women who underwent comprehensive staging for clinical stage I OCCC had an LN metastasis rate of 4.8%.

Downregulation of TRIM27 expression inhibits the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,Lab. Invest.,2015-11-16,"TRIM27 (tripartite motif-containing 27) was originally identified as a fusion partner with the RET (REarranged during transfection) proto-oncogene and is highly expressed in various tumor cells and tissues. However, the level of expression and function of TRIM27 in ovarian cancer remain unclear. Here we have measured the expression of TRIM27 in normal ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial cells and in ovarian serous carcinoma cells and correlated TRIM27 expression with clinical and pathological parameters. In addition, we detected the effect of TRIM27 knockdown on proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in cell culture and xenografts. The results demonstrated that TRIM27 was highly expressed in ovarian serous carcinoma cells, and TRIM27 expression was significantly correlated with metastasis and FIGO stage in ovarian serous carcinoma patients. Downregulation of TRIM27 expression suppressed the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells in cell culture and inhibited the growth of xenografts in nude mice. TRIM27 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells by upregulating the expression of p-P38 and downregulating the expression of p-AKT. Thus the present study suggests that TRIM27 could have important roles as an oncogene during the development of ovarian cancer and could serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.

Seventy-six patients with low-stage (FIGO I/II) sporadic ovarian carcinoma who underwent primary surgical management at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1980 to 2000 were included in the study. Histologic type was assigned using Gilks' criteria. Similar to the approach taken when distinguishing primary and metastatic mucinous or endometrioid carcinoma involving ovary, cases interpreted as showing a ""primary"" pattern of ovarian involvement had ≥3 of the following features: unilateral tumor, size >12 cm, no surface involvement, no multinodularity, and no destructive stromal invasion. All other cases were considered to show a ""metastatic"" pattern of ovarian involvement. Cases were evaluated for p53 and WT-1 expression, using standard techniques on a tissue microarray. TP53 gene sequencing was also performed. Cases comprised HGSC (n=22), endometrioid carcinoma (n=30), clear cell carcinoma (n=13), and mucinous carcinoma (n=11). HGSCs displayed substantially more ""metastatic features"" than the non-HGSC group and a mean overall size that was smaller (8.85 vs. 14.1 cm).

J. Gynecol. Cancer,2016-02-01,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity and tolerability of iniparib monotherapy in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2-associated advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Eligible patients had advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, measurable disease, and at least 1 previous treatment regimen of platinum/taxane chemotherapy. Patients received iniparib 8 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 4 weekly, with imaging every 8 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression or adverse events (AEs) prohibited further therapy. Common Terminology Criteria for AEs v3.0 was used to grade AEs. The primary endpoint was tumor response. The study was conducted with a Simon 2-stage design with 12 and 23 patients planned in the first and second stage, respectively. The study was designed to distinguish between 10% and 30% responding with types 1 and 2 error of 0.10. Twelve patients were treated on study, with median exposure to iniparib of 7.5 weeks. The median number of previous chemotherapeutic regimens was 7. Treatment-related AEs (≥10%) included asthenia (83.3%), constipation (25%), diarrhea (25%), nausea (25%), abdominal pain (16.7%), and decreased hemoglobin (16.7%). All treatment-related AEs were grades 1 or 2 with the following 2 exceptions: 1 grade 3 diarrhea and 1 grade 3 hypertension. One patient had stable disease lasting 2 cycles; the remaining 11 patients had progressive disease. The study did not proceed to second stage enrollment.

Characteristics of 10-year survivors of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-03-11,"High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) generally presents at an advanced stage with poor long-term (LT) survival. Here we describe clinical features found in women surviving HGSC for ten or more years. A multi-center research consortium was established between five participating academic centers. Patient selection criteria included high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma with at least ten years of follow up. Non-serous, borderline tumors and low-grade serous subtypes were excluded. The 203 identified LT ten-year survivors with HGSC were diagnosed at a median age of 57years (range 37-84years). The majority of patients had stage IIIC (72.4%) disease at presentation. Of those who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery, optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 143 (85.6%) patients. After a median follow up of 144months, 88 (46.8%) patients did not develop recurrent disease after initial treatment. Unexpected findings from this survey of LT survivors includes 14% of patients having had suboptimal cytoreduction, 11% of patients having an initial platinum free interval of <12months, and nearly 53% of patients having recurrent disease, yet still surviving more than ten years after diagnosis. LT survivors of HGSC of the ovary generally have favorable clinical features including optimal surgical cytoreduction and primary platinum sensitive disease. The majority of patients will develop recurrent disease, however many remained disease free for more than 10years.

Morphologic correlates of molecular alterations in extrauterine Müllerian carcinomas.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2016-05-06,"Extrauterine high-grade serous carcinomas can exhibit various histologic patterns including (1) classic architecture that is papillary, micropapillary and infiltrative and (2) solid, endometrioid, and transitional (ie, SET) patterns. Although the SET pattern has been associated with germline BRCA mutations, potential molecular underpinnings have not been fully investigated. DNA was isolated from 174 carcinomas of the fallopian tube, ovary, or peritoneum. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed and single-nucleotide and copy number variants were correlated with morphologic subtype. Overall, 79% of tumors were classified as high-grade serous carcinoma (n=138), and the most common mutations in high-grade serous carcinomas were TP53 (94%), BRCA1 (25%), BRCA2 (11%), and ATM (7%). Among chemotherapy-naive high-grade serous carcinomas, 40 cases exhibited classic morphology and 40 cases had non-classic morphology (SET or ambiguous features). Mutations in homologous recombination pathways were seen across all tumor histotypes. High-grade serous carcinomas with homologous recombination mutations were six times more likely to be associated with non-classic histology (P=0.002) and were significantly more likely to be platinum sensitive and have improved progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.007 and P=0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, homologous recombination mutation status and increased copy number variants were independently associated with improved PFS (P=0.008 and P=0.005, respectively).

Cited rationale for variance in the use of primary intraperitoneal chemotherapy following optimal cytoreduction for stage III ovarian carcinoma at a high intraperitoneal chemotherapy utilization center.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-05-21,"Studies have demonstrated improved ovarian cancer survival with the administration of a combination of intravenous (IV) and intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy following optimal cytoreduction. Despite this, IV/IP chemotherapy is not uniformly used. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed the documented reasons for giving IV-only chemotherapy. All patients who had optimal primary cytoreductive surgery for stage III ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma, met eligibility criteria for GOG-172, and received primary chemotherapy at our institution between 2006 and 2013 were identified. Patients who received at least one cycle of adjuvant IV/IP therapy were included in the IP group. Patient characteristics, treatment information, and reason cited for not administering IP therapy were collected. Of the patients evaluated, 330 met inclusion criteria. The majority (n=261, 79%) received at least one IV/IP cycle (median, 6; range, 1-6), and 62% completed 6cycles. The most common reason for giving IV-only therapy was postoperative status (i.e., delayed wound healing, performance status), accounting for 18 (26%) of the 69 IV-only patients (5% of the entire cohort). Other cited reasons were baseline comorbidities (15%) and IP port complications (12%). Receipt of ≥1cycle of IP chemotherapy (HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.80) and no gross residual disease (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.71) were associated with improved overall survival.

Multispectral fluorescence imaging of human ovarian and fallopian tube tissue for early-stage cancer detection.,Journal of biomedical optics,J Biomed Opt,2016-05-01,"With early detection, 5-year survival rates for ovarian cancer exceed 90%, yet no effective early screening method exists. Emerging consensus suggests over 50% of the most lethal form of the disease originates in the fallopian tube. Twenty-eight women undergoing oophorectomy or debulking surgery provided informed consent for the use of surgical discard tissue samples for multispectral fluorescence imaging. Using multiple ultraviolet and visible excitation wavelengths and emissions bands, 12 fluorescence and 6 reflectance images of 47 ovarian and 31 fallopian tube tissue samples were recorded. After imaging, each sample was fixed, sectioned, and stained for pathological evaluation. Univariate logistic regression showed cancerous tissue samples had significantly lower intensity than noncancerous tissue for 17 image types. The predictive power of multiple image types was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression (MLR) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). Two MLR models each using two image types had receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve exceeding 0.9.

Diverting ileostomy during primary debulking surgery for ovarian cancer: Associated factors and postoperative outcomes.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2016-06-04,"To examine the use, as well as postoperative and long-term oncologic outcomes of diverting loop ileostomy (DI) during primary debulking surgery (PDS) for ovarian cancer. Patients with stage II-IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma who underwent colon resection during PDS from 1/2005-1/2014 were identified. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Of 331 patients, 320 (97%) had stage III/IV disease and 278 (84%) had disease of high-grade serous histology. Forty-four (13%) underwent a DI. There were no significant differences in age, comorbidity index, smoking status, serum albumin, or attending surgeon between the DI and non-DI groups. Operative time (OR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.42; p=0.02) and length of rectosigmoid resection (OR=1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p=0.02) were predictors of DI on multivariable analysis. The overall anastomotic leak rate was 6%. A comparison of groups (DI vs non-DI) showed no significant differences in major complications (30% vs 23%; p=0.41), anastomotic leak rate (5% vs 7%; p=0.60), hospital length of stay (10 vs 9days; p=0.25), readmission rate (23% vs 17%; p=0.33), or interval to postoperative chemotherapy (41 vs 40days; p=0.20), respectively. Ileostomy reversal was successful in 89% of patients. Median follow-up was 52.6months.

"Phase 1 and 2 study of carboplatin and pralatrexate in patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.",Cancer,Cancer,2016-07-15,"The objective of this phase 1 and 2 trial was to identify the appropriate dose of combined carboplatin and pralatrexate for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer. In phase 1, patients received carboplatin (at an area under the curve of 5) and increasing doses of pralatrexate until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of pralatrexate was achieved. The primary endpoint was the response rate. Additional endpoints were safety, response duration, progression-free survival, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics. Thirty patients were enrolled in phase 1, and 20 were enrolled in phase 2. Of all 50 patients, 49 completed the study. The mean patient age was 59 years, and patients completed a median of 6 cycles. The MTD for pralatrexate was 105 mg/m<sup>2</sup> . The clinical benefit rate (complete responses plus partial responses plus stable disease) was 86%. Of 26 patients who received the MTD, 12 had a partial response, 11 had stable disease, and 2 had disease progression. The progression-free survival rate at 3 and 6 months was 87% and 79%, respectively; and the overall survival rate was 98% at 6 and 12 months and 66% at 24 months. Of 30 patients, 18 (60%) in phase 1 experienced an adverse event of any grade; and, of those, 4 patients (13%) had a grade 3 or greater adverse event. In phase 2, 12 patients (60%) had an adverse event of any grade, and 4 (20%) had grade 3 or greater toxicity. There was a significant reduction in the total body clearance of pralatrexate when it was received concurrently with carboplatin. Most patients responded to carboplatin-pralatrexate combination.

Premalignant SOX2 overexpression in the fallopian tubes of ovarian cancer patients: Discovery and validation studies.,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,2016-07-02,"Current screening methods for ovarian cancer can only detect advanced disease. Earlier detection has proved difficult because the molecular precursors involved in the natural history of the disease are unknown. To identify early driver mutations in ovarian cancer cells, we used dense whole genome sequencing of micrometastases and microscopic residual disease collected at three time points over three years from a single patient during treatment for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The functional and clinical significance of the identified mutations was examined using a combination of population-based whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, multi-center analysis of protein expression, loss of function experiments in an in-vivo reporter assay and mammalian models, and gain of function experiments in primary cultured fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells. We identified frequent mutations involving a 40kb distal repressor region for the key stem cell differentiation gene SOX2. In the apparently normal FTE, the region was also mutated. This was associated with a profound increase in SOX2 expression (p<2(-16)), which was not found in patients without cancer (n=108). Importantly, we show that SOX2 overexpression in FTE is nearly ubiquitous in patients with HGSOCs (n=100), and common in BRCA1-BRCA2 mutation carriers (n=71) who underwent prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. We propose that the finding of SOX2 overexpression in FTE could be exploited to develop biomarkers for detecting disease at a premalignant stage, which would reduce mortality from this devastating disease.

Thresholds and timing of pre-operative thrombocytosis and ovarian cancer survival: analysis of laboratory measures from electronic medical records.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2016-08-08,"Thrombocytosis has been associated with poor ovarian cancer prognosis. However, comparisons of thresholds to define thrombocytosis and evaluation of relevant timing of platelet measurement has not been previously conducted. We selected Tumor Registry confirmed ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer cases diagnosed between 1995-2013 from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Laboratory measured platelet values from electronic medical records (EMR) were used to determine thrombocytosis at three thresholds: a platelet count greater than 350, 400, or 450 × 10(9)/liter. Timing was evaluated with 5 intervals: on the date of diagnosis, and up to 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks prior to the date of diagnosis. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) for association with overall survival; adjustment included age, stage, grade, and histologic subtype of disease. Pre-diagnosis platelet measures were available for 136, 241, 280, 297, and 304 cases in the five intervals. The prevalence of thrombocytosis decreased with increasing thresholds and was generally consistent across the five time intervals, ranging from 44.8-53.2 %, 31.6-39.4 %, and 19.9-26.1 % across the three thresholds. Associations with higher grade and stage of disease gained significance as the threshold increased. With the exception of the lowest threshold on the date of diagnosis (HR350: 1.55, 95 % CI: 0.97-2.47), all other survival associations were significant, with the highest reaching twice the risk of death for thrombocytosis on the date of diagnosis (HR400: 2.01, 95 % CI: 1.25-3.23). Our EMR approach yielded associations comparable to published findings from medical record abstraction approaches.

Additional information is available at www.asco.org/NACT-ovarian-guideline and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki.",Journal Article,1261.0,75.0,To provide guidance to clinicians regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction among women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial cancer The Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature Four phase III clinical trials form the primary evidence base for the recommendations The published studies suggest that for selected women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction are non-inferior to primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy with respect to overall and progression-free survival and are associated with less perioperative morbidity and mortality All women with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive epithelial cancer should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist prior to initiation of therapy The primary clinical evaluation should include a CT of the abdomen and pelvis and chest imaging CT preferred Women with a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to 1cm of residual disease ideally to no visible disease should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy Women who are fit for primary cytoreductive surgery and with potentially resectable disease may receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or primary cytoreductive surgery However primary cytoreductive surgery is preferred if there is a high likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to 1cm ideally to no visible disease with acceptable morbidity Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy is delivered all patients should have confirmation of an invasive tube or

Randomized Phase II Trial of Seribantumab in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Platinum-Resistant or -Refractory Ovarian Cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2016-10-23,"Purpose Seribantumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 3 (ErbB3), blocking heregulin (HRG) -mediated ErbB3 signaling and inducing ErbB3 receptor downregulation. This open-label randomized phase II study evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) with seribantumab in combination with once-per-week paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer. A key secondary objective was to determine if any of five prespecified biomarkers predicted benefit from seribantumab. Patients and Methods Patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer were randomly assigned at a ratio of two to one to receive seribantumab plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone. Patients underwent pretreatment core needle biopsy; archival tumor samples were also obtained to support biomarker analyses. Results A total of 223 patients were randomly assigned (seribantumab plus paclitaxel, n = 140; paclitaxel alone, n = 83). Median PFS in the unselected intent-to-treat population was 3.75 months with seribantumab plus paclitaxel compared with 3.68 months with paclitaxel alone (hazard ratio [HR], 1.027; 95% CI, 0.741 to 1.425; P = .864). Among patients whose tumors had detectable HRG mRNA and low HER2 (n = 57 [38%] of 151 with available biomarker data), increased treatment benefit was observed in those receiving seribantumab plus paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone (PFS HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.76; P = .007). The HR in patients not meeting these criteria was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.98; P = .023). Conclusion The addition of seribantumab to paclitaxel did not result in improved PFS in unselected patients. Exploratory analyses suggest that detectable HRG and low HER2, biomarkers that link directly to the mechanism of action of seribantumab, identified patients who might benefit from this combination. Future clinical trials are needed to validate this finding and should preselect for HRG expression and focus on cancers with low HER2 levels.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1185.0,26.0,Purpose

Clin. Oncol.,2016-12-28,"Purpose This phase I expansion cohort study evaluated the safety and clinical activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853), an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized anti-folate receptor alpha (FRα) monoclonal antibody linked to the tubulin-disrupting maytansinoid DM4, in a population of patients with FRα-positive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Patients and Methods Patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer received IMGN853 at 6.0 mg/kg (adjusted ideal body weight) once every 3 weeks. Eligibility included a minimum requirement of FRα positivity by immunohistochemistry (≥ 25% of tumor cells with at least 2+ staining intensity). Adverse events, tumor response (via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1), and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined. Results Forty-six patients were enrolled. Adverse events were generally mild (≤ grade 2), with diarrhea (44%), blurred vision (41%), nausea (37%), and fatigue (30%) being the most commonly observed treatment-related toxicities. Grade 3 fatigue and hypotension were reported in two patients each (4%). For all evaluable patients, the confirmed objective response rate was 26%, including one complete and 11 partial responses, and the median PFS was 4.8 months. The median duration of response was 19.1 weeks. Notably, in the subset of patients who had received three or fewer prior lines of therapy (n = 23), an objective response rate of 39%, PFS of 6.7 months, and duration of response of 19.6 weeks were observed. Conclusion IMGN853 exhibited a manageable safety profile and was active in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with the strongest signals of efficacy observed in less heavily pretreated individuals. On the basis of these findings, the dose, schedule, and target population were identified for a phase III trial of IMGN853 monotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant disease.","Clinical Trial,

"Optimal primary management of bulky stage IIIC ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinoma: Are the only options complete gross resection at primary debulking surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy?",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-02-21,"To explore the impact of primary debulking surgery (PDS) to minimal but gross residual disease (RD) in women with bulky stage IIIC ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. We retrospectively reviewed all patients with the aforementioned diagnosis who underwent PDS at our institution from 01/2001-12/2010. Those with disease of non-epithelial histology or borderline tumors were excluded. Clinicopathologic data were abstracted, and appropriate statistical tests were used. We identified 496 eligible patients. Median age was 62years; 91% had disease of serous histology. Patients were grouped by RD status: no gross RD, 184 (37%); RD of 1-5mm, 127 (26%); RD of 6-10mm, 54 (11%); and RD >10mm, 131 (26%). With a median follow-up of 53months, the median progression-free survivals (PFS) were: 26.7, 20.7, 16.2, and 13.6months, respectively (p<0.001). The median overall survivals (OS) were 83.4, 54.5, 43.8, and 38.9months, respectively (p<0.001). Among patients with RD following PDS, those with RD of 1-10mm had improved PFS (p<0.001) and OS (p=0.001) compared with those with RD >10mm. Patients with RD 1-10mm who received intravenous/intraperitoneal (IV/IP) chemotherapy were younger and had prolonged OS compared with those solely exposed to IV chemotherapy (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). PDS to no gross RD was associated with the longest PFS and OS. However, cytoreduction to 1-10mm of RD was also associated with better survival outcomes compared with cytoreduction to >10mm of RD.

Risk-reducing salpingectomy: Let us be opportunistic.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-03-23,"Because there is no screening test for ovarian cancer, effective prevention strategies may be the best way to reduce the mortality of this most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that the fallopian tube is the site of origin for the vast majority of high-grade serous carcinomas. Our growing understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease offers a rare opportunity to explore new preventive measures, such as bilateral salpingectomy, which may provide great benefit without compromising ovarian function. If the tubal paradigm is accurate, then the impact of bilateral salpingectomy could extend to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, high-risk noncarriers, and average-risk women. The authors present a review of the literature on the role of risk-reducing salpingectomy in all women and in high-risk groups, with a focus on morbidity, ovarian function, potential clinical applicability, and epidemiological considerations.

Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-04-21,"Platinum-based chemotherapy doublets are a standard of care for women with ovarian cancer recurring 6 months after completion of initial therapy. In this study, we aimed to explore the roles of secondary surgical cytoreduction and bevacizumab in this population, and report the results of the bevacizumab component here. The multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 GOG-0213 trial was done in 67 predominantly academic centres in the USA (65 centres), Japan (one centre), and South Korea (one centre). Eligible patients were adult women (aged ≥18 years) with recurrent measurable or evaluable epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and a clinical complete response to primary platinum-based chemotherapy, who had been disease-free for at least 6 months following last infused cycle of platinum. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard chemotherapy (six 3-weekly cycles of paclitaxel [175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area] and carboplatin [area under the curve 5]) or the same chemotherapy regimen plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of bodyweight) every 3 weeks and continued as maintenance every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Individuals who participated in both the bevacizumab objective and surgical objective (which is ongoing) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either of these two chemotherapy regimens with or without prior secondary cytoreductive surgery. Randomisation for the bevacizumab objective was stratified by treatment-free interval and participation in the surgical objective. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00565851. Between Dec 10, 2007, and Aug 26, 2011, 674 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to standard chemotherapy (n=337) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (n=377). Median follow-up at the end of the trial on Nov 5, 2014, was 49·6 months in each treatment group (IQR 41·5-62·2 for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab; IQR 40·8-59·3 for chemotherapy), at which point 415 patients had died (214 in the chemotherapy group and 201 in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group). Based on pretreatment stratification data, median overall survival in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group was 42·2 months (95% CI 37·7-46·2) versus 37·3 months (32·6-39·7) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·829; 95% CI 0·683-1·005; p=0·056). We identified incorrect treatment-free interval stratification data for 45 (7%) patients (equally balanced between treatment groups); a sensitivity analysis of overall survival based on the audited treatment-free interval stratification data gave an adjusted HR of 0·823 (95% CI 0·680-0·996; p=0·0447). In the safety population (all patients who initiated treatment), 317 (96%) of 325 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group had at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event compared with 282 (86%) of 332 in the chemotherapy group; the most frequently reported of these in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group were hypertension (39 [12%] vs two [1%]), fatigue (27 [8%] vs eight [2%]), and proteinuria (27 [8%] vs none). Two (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the chemotherapy group (infection [n=1] and myelodysplastic syndrome [n=1]) compared with nine (3%) in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group (infection [n=1], febrile neutropenia [n=1], myelodysplastic syndrome [n=1], secondary malignancy [n=1]; deaths not classified with CTCAE terms: disease progression [n=3], sudden death [n=1], and not specified [n=1]). The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy, followed by maintenance therapy until progression, improved the median overall survival in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Although the intention-to-treat analysis for overall survival was not significant, our sensitivity analysis based on corrected treatment-free interval stratification indicates that this strategy might be an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in these patients.

Phase 2 trial of everolimus and letrozole in relapsed estrogen receptor-positive high-grade ovarian cancers.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-04-28,"We report the results of a phase 2 clinical trial of the combination of everolimus and letrozole in patients with relapsed estrogen receptor-positive high-grade ovarian cancer. The trial's primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and progression-free after 12weeks of therapy with the combination of everolimus and letrozole. A 12-week PFS of 45% or greater was considered a positive result. The feasibility of generating patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from biopsy specimens was also evaluated. Eligibility criteria included relapsed estrogen receptor-positive ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas with measurable disease, not previously treated with everolimus or AIs. Both platinum-resistant and sensitive tumors were included. Xenografts were created from image-guided tumor biopsies at baseline. Patients received oral everolimus 10mg daily and letrozole 2.5mg daily. Twenty patients were enrolled, 19 were evaluable. Nine out of 19 were alive, progression-free, and still on treatment at the 12week evaluation time-point (12-week PFS of 47%) with a median PFS of 3.9months (95% CI: 2.8-11.0). The median overall survival was 13.0months. Twelve patients (63%) experienced at least one grade 3 or worse adverse events. PDX tumor engraftment was feasible in the majority of patients (9 out of 17, 52.9%). The combination of everolimus and letrozole is associated with a promising 47% 12-week PFS rate in patients with ER-positive relapsed high-grade ovarian cancer with acceptable toxicity. PDX tumor models can be generated from biopsies of ovarian tumors.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",998.0,9.0,We report the results of a phase 2 clinical trial of the combination of everolimus and letrozole in patients with relapsed estrogen receptor-positive high-grade cancer The trial 's primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and progression-free after 12weeks of therapy with the combination of everolimus and letrozole A 12-week PFS of 45 or greater was considered a positive result The feasibility of generating patient-derived xenograft PDX models from biopsy specimens was also evaluated Eligibility criteria included relapsed estrogen receptor-positive tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas with measurable disease not previously treated with everolimus or AIs Both platinum-resistant and sensitive tumors were included Xenografts were created from image-guided tumor biopsies at baseline Patients received oral everolimus 10mg daily and letrozole 2.5mg daily Twenty patients were enrolled 19 were evaluable Nine out of 19 were alive progression-free and still on treatment at the 12week evaluation time-point 12-week PFS of 47 with a median PFS of 3.9months 95 CI 2.8-11.0 The median overall survival was 13.0months Twelve patients 63 experienced at least one grade 3 or worse adverse events PDX tumor engraftment was feasible in the majority of patients 9 out of 17 52.9 The combination of everolimus and letrozole is associated with a promising 47 12-week PFS rate in patients with ER-positive relapsed high-grade cancer with acceptable toxicity PDX tumor models can be generated from biopsies of tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[21, 414, 3, 99, 1, 8, 124, 18, 38, 160, 1, 3, 150, 1, 1400, 2, 2800, 4, 7, 5, 591, 808, 153, 109, 64, 88, 12, 3, 160, 292, 86, 1138, 10, 3, 920, 1, 7, 1701, 2, 91, 115, 50, 29889, 1, 36, 5, 3, 150, 1, 1400, 2, 2800, 8, 133, 647, 300, 1, 512, 15, 378, 10, 515, 8, 109, 757, 3, 1437, 1, 3997, 69, 526, 1330, 3250, 274, 29, 411, 623, 10, 120, 194, 2317, 371, 159, 591, 808, 153, 109, 2330, 15, 86, 1639, 826, 5, 1884, 34, 44, 373, 73, 5, 1400, 15, 3826, 110, 828, 436, 2, 745, 57, 11, 159, 1348, 11, 2466, 29, 1482, 1808, 30, 1154, 28, 330, 7, 103, 518, 1400, 12176, 391, 2, 2800, 18, 11356, 391, 737, 7, 11, 346, 326, 11, 859, 762, 1205, 1, 326, 11, 1701, 91, 115, 2, 1234, 23, 24, 28, 3, 50344, 451, 98, 741, 133, 647, 300, 1, 662, 5, 8, 52, 300, 1, 27, 16988, 48, 58, 18, 66, 175, 13, 3, 52, 63, 25, 10, 233, 20846, 2544, 7, 676, 592, 28, 506, 104, 88, 27, 15, 639, 290, 281, 3250, 30, 2881, 10, 1313, 4, 3, 686, 1, 7, 83, 1205, 1, 269, 653, 83, 3, 150, 1, 1400, 2, 2800, 16, 41, 5, 8, 721, 662, 133, 647, 300, 116, 4, 7, 5, 516, 109, 591, 64, 88, 12, 5, 1595, 155, 3250, 30, 274, 122, 40, 1419, 29, 1154, 1, 57]",1521.0,"['report', 'phase', 'clinical', 'trial', 'combination', 'everolimus', 'letrozole', 'patient', 'relapsed', 'estrogen', 'receptor', 'positive', 'high', 'grade', 'ovarian', 'trial', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'wa', 'proportion', 'patient', 'alive', 'progression', 'free', 'week', 'therapy', 'combination', 'everolimus', 'letrozole', 'week', 'pfs', 'greater', 'wa', 'considered', 'positive', 'feasibility', 'generating', 'patient', 'derived', 'xenograft', 'pdx', 'model', 'biopsy', 'specimen', 'wa', 'evaluated', 'eligibility', 'criterion', 'included', 'relapsed', 'estrogen', 'receptor', 'positive', 'ovarian', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'primary', 'peritoneal', 'carcinoma', 'measurable', 'disease', 'previously', 'treated', 'everolimus', 'ai', 'platinum', 'resistant', 'sensitive', 'included', 'xenograft', 'created', 'image', 'guided', 'biopsy', 'baseline', 'patient', 'received', 'oral', 'everolimus', 'mg', 'daily', 'letrozole', 'mg', 'daily', 'patient', 'enrolled', 'evaluable', 'alive', 'progression', 'free', 'treatment', 'week', 'evaluation', 'time', 'point', 'week', 'pfs', 'median', 'pfs', 'month', 'ci', 'median', 'overall', 'survival', 'wa', 'month', 'patient', 'experienced', 'grade', 'worse', 'adverse', 'event', 'pdx', 'engraftment', 'wa', 'feasible', 'majority', 'patient', 'combination', 'everolimus', 'letrozole', 'associated', 'promising', 'week', 'pfs', 'rate', 'patient', 'er', 'positive', 'relapsed', 'high', 'grade', 'ovarian', 'acceptable', 'toxicity', 'pdx', 'model', 'generated', 'biopsy', 'ovarian']",28461031,5,0.029069767441860465
Prognostic value of miliary versus non-miliary sub-staging in advanced ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2017-05-08,"The presence of miliary disease during initial ovarian cancer debulking may reflect a distinct mode of peritoneal spread independent from size-based tumor staging and may explain variation in response to treatment and survival outcomes. To infer the prevalence, presentation and clinical implications of miliary disease we reviewed existing surgical records. Reports were available for 1008 primary debulking surgeries for ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer between 2001 and 2015 (685 reports from 2005 to 2015). Clinical outcome data was available for 938 patients. We analyzed a high-stage sub-cohort for survival (N=436). Most records were evaluable for miliary disease (761/938); for these, the miliary phenotype was highly prevalent (249/761, 32.7%) and often accompanied by ascites (185/249, 74%). While optimal debulking rates were unaffected by miliary disease, total resection (R0) rates were poorer. Liver, stomach, spleen or bladder appeared to be sporadically involved while the omentum, mesentery, bowel, peritoneum and diaphragm were affected simultaneously (Spearman rho>0.5). Overall, miliary disease was associated with worse progression free survival, overall survival, and time from relapse to death independent of stage.

PRKCI promotes immune suppression in ovarian cancer.,Genes & development,Genes Dev.,2017-07-11,"A key feature of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is frequent amplification of the 3q26 locus harboring <i>PRKC-ι</i> (<i>PRKCI</i>). Here, we show that PRKCI is also expressed in early fallopian tube lesions, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma. Transgenic mouse studies establish <i>PRKCI</i> as an ovarian cancer-specific oncogene. Mechanistically, we show that the oncogenic activity of PRKCI relates in part to the up-regulation of TNFα to promote an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by an abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. Furthermore, system-level and functional analyses identify YAP1 as a downstream effector in tumor progression. In human ovarian cancers, high PRKCI expression also correlates with high expression of TNFα and YAP1 and low infiltration of cytotoxic T cells.

We aimed to confirm these findings in patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation using a tablet formulation of olaparib. This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated olaparib tablet maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation who had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or matching placebo tablets using an interactive voice and web response system. Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-free interval (6-12 months vs ≥12 months) and treatment assignment was masked for patients, those giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing study. The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874353, and is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients. Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to receive olaparib (n=196) or placebo (n=99). One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not receive study treatment. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib (19·1 months [95% CI 16·3-25·7]) than with placebo (5·5 months [5·2-5·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·30 [95% CI 0·22-0·41], p<0·0001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity were anaemia (38 [19%] of 195 patients in the olaparib group vs two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group), fatigue or asthenia (eight [4%] vs two [2%]), and neutropenia (ten [5%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group. The most common in the olaparib group were anaemia (seven [4%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] patients). The most common in the placebo group were constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction (two [2%] patients). One (1%) patient in the olaparib group had a treatment-related adverse event (acute myeloid leukaemia) with an outcome of death. Olaparib tablet maintenance treatment provided a significant progression-free survival improvement with no detrimental effect on quality of life in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation. Apart from anaemia, toxicities with olaparib were low grade and manageable.

BRCA1/2 mutation who had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1 and histologically confirmed relapsed high-grade serous cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer including primary peritoneal or tube cancer Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib 300 mg in two 150 mg tablets twice daily or matching placebo tablets using an interactive voice and web response system Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy complete vs partial and length of platinum-free interval 6-12 months vs ≥12 months and treatment assignment was masked for patients those giving the interventions data collectors and data analysers The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing study The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01874353 and is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients Between Sept 3 2013 and Nov 21 2014 we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to receive olaparib n=196 or placebo n=99 One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not receive study treatment Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib 19·1 months 95 CI 16·3-25·7 than with placebo 5·5 months 5·2-5·8 hazard

"Rucaparib maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian carcinoma after response to platinum therapy (ARIEL3): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.","Lancet (London, England)",Lancet,2017-09-12,"Rucaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a BRCA mutation or high percentage of genome-wide loss of heterozygosity. In this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 hospitals and cancer centres across 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, had received at least two previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, had achieved complete or partial response to their last platinum-based regimen, had a cancer antigen 125 concentration of less than the upper limit of normal, had a performance status of 0-1, and had adequate organ function. Patients were ineligible if they had symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases, had received anticancer therapy 14 days or fewer before starting the study, or had received previous treatment with a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. We randomly allocated patients 2:1 to receive oral rucaparib 600 mg twice daily or placebo in 28 day cycles using a computer-generated sequence (block size of six, stratified by homologous recombination repair gene mutation status, progression-free interval after the penultimate platinum-based regimen, and best response to the most recent platinum-based regimen). Patients, investigators, site staff, assessors, and the funder were masked to assignments. The primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival evaluated with use of an ordered step-down procedure for three nested cohorts: patients with BRCA mutations (carcinoma associated with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations), patients with homologous recombination deficiencies (BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and high loss of heterozygosity), and the intention-to-treat population, assessed at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01968213; enrolment is complete. Between April 7, 2014, and July 19, 2016, we randomly allocated 564 patients: 375 (66%) to rucaparib and 189 (34%) to placebo. Median progression-free survival in patients with a BRCA-mutant carcinoma was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·4-22·9; 130 [35%] patients) in the rucaparib group versus 5·4 months (3·4-6·7; 66 [35%] patients) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·23 [95% CI 0·16-0·34]; p<0·0001). In patients with a homologous recombination deficient carcinoma (236 [63%] vs 118 [62%]), it was 13·6 months (10·9-16·2) versus 5·4 months (5·1-5·6; 0·32 [0·24-0·42]; p<0·0001). In the intention-to-treat population, it was 10·8 months (8·3-11·4) versus 5·4 months (5·3-5·5; 0·36 [0·30-0·45]; p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the safety population (372 [99%] patients in the rucaparib group vs 189 [100%] in the placebo group) were reported in 209 (56%) patients in the rucaparib group versus 28 (15%) in the placebo group, the most common of which were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin concentration (70 [19%] vs one [1%]) and increased alanine or aspartate aminotransferase concentration (39 [10%] vs none). Across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. ARIEL3 provides further evidence that use of a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor in the maintenance treatment setting versus placebo could be considered a new standard of care for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer following a complete or partial response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy.

complete or partial response to their last platinum-based regimen had a cancer antigen 125 concentration of less than the upper limit of normal had a performance status of 0-1 and had adequate organ function Patients were ineligible if they had symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases had received anticancer therapy 14 days or fewer before starting the study or had received previous treatment with a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor We randomly allocated patients 2:1 to receive oral rucaparib 600 mg twice daily or placebo in 28 day cycles using a computer-generated sequence block size of six stratified by homologous recombination repair gene mutation status progression-free interval after the penultimate platinum-based regimen and best response to the most recent platinum-based regimen Patients investigators site staff assessors and the funder were masked to assignments The primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival evaluated with use of an ordered step-down procedure for three nested cohorts patients with BRCA mutations carcinoma associated with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations patients with homologous recombination deficiencies BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and high loss of heterozygosity and the intention-to-treat population assessed at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01968213 enrolment is complete Between April 7 2014 and July 19 2016 we randomly allocated 564 patients 375 66 to rucaparib and 189 34 to placebo Median progression-free survival in patients with a BRCA-mutant carcinoma was 16·6 months 95 CI 13·4-22·9 130 35 patients in the rucaparib group versus 5·4 months 3·4-6·7 66 35 patients in the placebo group

population 372 99 patients in the rucaparib group vs 189 100 in the placebo group were reported in 209 56 patients in the rucaparib group versus 28 15 in the placebo group the most common of which were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin concentration 70 19 vs one 1 and increased alanine or aspartate aminotransferase concentration 39 10 vs none Across all primary analysis groups rucaparib significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive cancer who had achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy ARIEL3 provides further evidence that use of a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor in the maintenance treatment setting versus placebo could be considered a new standard of care for women with platinum-sensitive cancer following a complete or partial response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy Clovis Oncology,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[10515, 8, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 230, 71, 1475, 128,

Paclitaxel With and Without Pazopanib for Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA oncology,JAMA Oncol,2018-02-01,"Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths in the United States. Pazopanib is an oral, multitarget kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β; and proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT). To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) hazard ratio (HR) of weekly paclitaxel and pazopanib compared with weekly paclitaxel and placebo in women with recurrent ovarian cancer. Secondary objectives included frequency and severity of adverse events, proportion responding, and overall survival (OS) in each arm. Translational research objectives included exploring the association between possible biomarkers and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor A, interleukin 8, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; and PFS, OS, and proportion responding. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2 study was conducted at 26 participating institutions. Patients were enrolled between December 12, 2011, and April 22, 2013. Data were frozen on August 11, 2014. Participants were patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma with 1 to 3 prior regimens and performance status of 0 to 2. One hundred six patients enrolled; 100 were evaluable for toxic effects. All patients received paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days and were randomized 1:1 to pazopanib 800 mg orally daily or placebo. The primary end point was PFS. The study was designed to detect a 37.5% reduction in the hazard with 80% power (α = 10%). A total of 106 women (median age [range], 61 [35-87] years; 88 [83%] white) were enrolled. Study arms were well balanced for age, performance status, measurable disease, and prior bevacizumab. Proportion responding was 14 of 44 (31.8%) vs 10 of 44 (22.7%) for pazopanib plus paclitaxel vs paclitaxel alone. Median PFS was 7.5 vs 6.2 months for pazopanib plus paclitaxel vs paclitaxel alone, respectively (HR, 0.84; 90% CI, 0.57-1.22; P = .20). Median OS was 20.7 vs 23.3 months for pazopanib plus paclitaxel vs paclitaxel alone (HR, 1.04; 90% CI, 0.60-1.79; P = .90). Severe hypertension was more common on the pazopanib plus paclitaxel arm (relative risk, 12.0; 95% CI, 1.62-88.84). More patients discontinued treatment on the paclitaxel arm for disease progression (34 of 52 [65.4%] vs 17 of 54 [31.5%]), and more on the pazopanib plus paclitaxel arm for adverse events (20 of 54 [37%] vs 5 of 52 [9.6%]). No association was found between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (interleukin 8 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) and OS and proportion responding. Patients with VEGFA CC genotype may be more resistant to weekly paclitaxel than those with the AC or AA genotype, with 1 of 14 (7%), 3 of 15 (20%), and 4 of 8 (50%) responding, respectively.

Cancer Res.,2018-03-02,"<b>Purpose:</b> Epigenetic changes are implicated in acquired resistance to platinum. Guadecitabine is a next-generation hypomethylating agent (HMA). Here, we report the clinical results, along with pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic analyses of the phase I study of guadecitabine and carboplatin in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC), or fallopian tube cancer (FTC).<b>Experimental Design:</b> Guadecitabine was administered once daily on days 1 to 5 followed by carboplatin i.v. on day 8 of a 28-day cycle. Patients had either measurable or detectable disease. Safety assessments used CTCAE v4.<b>Results:</b> Twenty patients were enrolled and treated. Median age was 56 years (38-72 years). The median number of prior regimens was 7 (1-14). In the first cohort (<i>N</i> = 6), the starting doses were guadecitabine 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and carboplatin AUC5. Four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), leading to dose deescalation of guadecitabine to 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and of carboplatin to AUC4. No DLTs were observed in the subsequent 14 patients. Grade ≥3 adverse events ≥10% were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, ascites, constipation, hypokalemia, pulmonary embolism, small-intestinal obstruction, and thrombocytopenia. Three patients had a partial response (PR), and 6 patients had stable disease (SD) >3 months, for an overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate of 15% and 45%, respectively.

Avelumab (anti-PD-L1) in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer: JAVELIN Ovarian 200 Phase III study design.,"Future oncology (London, England)",Future Oncol,2018-03-27,"Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor with clinical activity in multiple solid tumors. Here, we describe the rationale and design for JAVELIN Ovarian 200 (NCT02580058), the first randomized Phase III trial to evaluate the role of checkpoint inhibition in women with ovarian cancer.

Patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal tumors with at least 50% clear cell histomorphology, measurable disease, one or two prior regimens and ECOG performance status 0-2 received cabozantinib 60 mg orally once daily continuously, in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) at six months and complete or partial tumor response (as assessed by RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints included toxicity, PFS, and overall survival (OS). Over 19 months, 13 patients were accrued. Fifty-four percent of patients were ≥60 years of age. Performance statuses of 0 and 1 comprised 8 and 5 patients. No objective tumor responses were seen. Three (23% [95% CI: 5%, 54%]) of 13 patients had PFS ≥6 months, including one patient who received cabozantinib for 23 cycles and was still on treatment as of the data cut-off date. Median PFS and OS were 3.6 and 8.1 months, respectively. There was one patient with a grade 5 event: a thromboembolic event considered possibly related to study therapy; patient's cause of death was determined to be due to disease and protocol treatment. Four other patients had thromboembolic events (two grade 3 and one each grade 1 and grade 2).

"Safety and activity findings from a phase 1b escalation study of mirvetuximab soravtansine, a folate receptor alpha (FRα)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in combination with carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-08-06,"To evaluate the safety profile and preliminary antitumor activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine when administered in combination with carboplatin to relapsed ovarian cancer patients. Patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian or fallopian tube cancer were enrolled. Eligibility included a minimum requirement of tumor FRα positivity (≥25% of cells with ≥2+ staining intensity). Patients received escalating doses of mirvetuximab soravtansine and carboplatin on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (once every 3 weeks). Mirvetuximab soravtansine maintenance therapy was permitted, at the investigators discretion, following cessation of carboplatin treatment. Adverse events, tumor response, and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined. Eighteen patients were enrolled and dosed with combination therapy; thirteen continued with mirvetuximab soravtansine maintenance following carboplatin discontinuation. Mirvetuximab soravtansine dosing was escalated from 5 to 6 mg/kg (adjusted ideal body weight) and carboplatin from AUC4 to AUC5. Adverse events were generally mild (≤ grade 2) with nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, blurred vision, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent toxicities. For all evaluable patients (n = 17), the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 71%, including three complete responses and nine partial responses, and the median PFS was 15 months.

Perioperative epidural use and survival outcomes in patients undergoing primary debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-09-02,"Epidurals are associated with improved outcomes in some solid tumors, presumably due to their effect on surgical stress response. There are limited data on the prognostic significance of epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing primary debulking surgery (PDS) for advanced ovarian cancer. We sought to assess the impact of epidural anesthesia on the survival outcomes of patients undergoing PDS for advanced ovarian cancer. In this retrospective study, consecutive patients with stage IIIB-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma who underwent PDS at our institution from 01/2005-12/2013 were identified. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with regard to epidural use were analyzed. Of 648 patients, 435 received an epidural and 213 did not. Patients in the former group were more likely to have higher stage disease (stage IV disease, 26% vs. 16%, respectively; P = .005), carcinomatosis (87% vs. 80%, respectively; P = .027), and bulky upper abdominal disease (66% vs. 58%, respectively; P = .046). Complete gross resection was achieved in 48% and 32%, respectively (P < .001). For the epidural vs. non-epidural groups, median PFS was 20.8 months and 13.9 months, respectively (P = .021); median OS was 62.4 months and 41.9 months, respectively (P < .001). After controlling for confounding factors, including residual disease, epidural use was independently associated with a decreased risk of progression (HR = 1.327; 95% CI, 1.066-1.653) and death (HR = 1.588; 95% CI, 1.224-2.06).

The fallopian tubes and ovaries of 479 high-risk women ≥30 years of age who underwent bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy were reviewed for invasive cancer/STICs/STILs. Epidemiologic data was available for 400 of these women. In 105 women, extensive sampling of the tubes for STICs/STILs/p53 signatures were undertaken. Descriptive statistics were used to compare groups with and without lesions. The combined prevalence of unique tubal lesions [invasive serous cancer (<i>n</i> = 6) /STICs (<i>n</i> = 14)/STILs (<i>n</i> = 5)] was 6.3% and this was split equally among <i>BRCA1</i> (3.0%) and <i>BRCA2</i> mutation carriers (3.3%). A diagnosis of invasive cancer was associated with older age but no risk/protective factor was significantly associated with STICs/STILs. Extensive sampling identified double the number of STICs/STILs (11.9%), many p53 signatures (27.0%), and multiple lesions in 50% of the cases. Women with p53 signatures in the fimbria were older than women with signatures in the remaining tube (<i>P</i> = 0.03). STICs/STILs may not share the protective factors that are associated with HGSC. It is plausible that these factors are only associated with STICs that progress to HGSC. Having multiple lesions in the fimbria may be an important predictor of disease progression. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 11(11); 697-706. ©2018 AACR</i>.",Journal Article,489.0,10.0,The prognosis of women diagnosed with invasive high-grade serous carcinoma HGSC is poor More information about serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma STIC and serous tubal intraepithelial lesions STIL putative precursor lesions of HGSC could inform prevention efforts We conducted a multicenter study to identify risk/protective factors associated with STIC/STILs and characterize p53 signatures in the tube The tubes and ovaries of 479 high-risk women ≥30 years of age who underwent bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy were reviewed for invasive cancer/STICs/STILs Epidemiologic data was available for 400 of these women In 105 women extensive sampling of the tubes for STICs/STILs/p53 signatures were undertaken Descriptive statistics were used to compare groups with and without lesions The combined prevalence of unique tubal lesions invasive serous cancer i n /i 6 /STICs i n /i 14 /STILs i n /i 5 was 6.3 and this was split equally among i BRCA1 /i 3.0 and i BRCA2 /i mutation carriers 3.3 A diagnosis of invasive cancer was associated with older age but no risk/protective factor was significantly associated with STICs/STILs Extensive sampling identified double the number of STICs/STILs 11.9 many p53 signatures 27.0 and multiple lesions in 50 of the cases Women with p53 signatures in the fimbria were older than women with signatures in the remaining tube i P /i 0.03 STICs/STILs may not share the protective factors that are associated with HGSC It is plausible that these factors are only associated with STICs that progress to HGSC Having multiple lesions in the fimbria may be an important predictor of disease progression i Cancer Prev Res 11 11 697-706 ©2018 AACR /i,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 356, 1, 117, 265, 5, 416, 64, 88, 1744, 134, 9144, 16, 334, 80, 487, 545, 1744, 6674, 4153, 134, 14034, 2, 1744, 6674, 4153, 406, 22852, 2743, 2765, 406, 1, 9144, 359, 2295, 1070, 1413, 21, 426, 8, 1570, 45, 6, 255, 43, 2864, 130, 41, 5, 14034, 15073, 2, 1507, 624, 2210, 4, 3, 2330, 3, 6193, 2, 7262, 1, 10875, 64, 43, 117, 7783, 60, 1, 89, 54, 208, 1607, 43, 1818, 5690, 3470, 11, 446, 9, 416, 12, 22691, 15073, 3609, 74, 10, 390, 9, 1524, 1, 46, 117, 4, 3263, 117, 1344, 2874, 1, 3, 6193, 9, 22691, 15073, 624, 2210, 11, 2789, 3778, 3065, 11, 95, 6, 932, 271, 5, 2, 187, 406, 3, 397, 1078, 1, 991, 6674, 406, 416, 1744, 12, 70, 78, 70, 49, 22691, 70, 78, 70, 213, 15073, 70, 78, 70, 33, 10, 49, 27, 2, 26, 10, 6240, 4142, 107, 70, 766, 70, 27, 13, 2, 70, 1167, 70, 258, 1316, 27, 27, 8, 147, 1, 416, 12, 10, 41, 5, 434, 89, 84, 77, 43, 2864, 161, 10, 97, 41, 5, 22691, 15073, 1344, 2874, 108, 1627, 3, 207, 1, 22691, 15073, 175, 83, 445, 624, 2210, 428, 13, 2, 232, 406, 4, 212, 1, 3, 140, 117, 5, 624, 2210, 4, 3, 25257, 11, 434, 76, 117, 5, 2210, 4, 3, 1844, 2330, 70, 19, 70, 13, 680, 22691, 15073, 68, 44, 4349, 3, 2864, 130, 17, 32, 41, 5, 9144, 192, 16, 7761, 17, 46, 130, 32, 158, 41, 5, 22691, 17, 1466, 6, 9144, 1041, 232, 406, 4, 3, 25257, 68, 40, 35, 305, 980, 1, 34, 91, 70, 12, 7902, 1936, 175, 175, 11989, 10964, 4281, 1630, 70]",1693.0,"['prognosis', 'woman', 'diagnosed', 'invasive', 'high', 'grade', 'serous', 'ovarian', 'carcinoma', 'hgsc', 'poor', 'information', 'serous', 'tubal', 'intraepithelial', 'carcinoma', 'stic', 'serous', 'tubal', 'intraepithelial', 'lesion', 'stil', 'putative', 'precursor', 'lesion', 'hgsc', 'inform', 'prevention', 'effort', 'conducted', 'multicenter', 'identify', 'risk', 'protective', 'factor', 'associated', 'stic', 'stils', 'characterize', 'signature', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'fallopian', 'tube', 'ovary', 'high', 'risk', 'woman', 'year', 'age', 'underwent', 'bilateral', 'risk', 'reducing', 'salpingo', 'oophorectomy', 'reviewed', 'invasive', 'stics', 'stils', 'epidemiologic', 'wa', 'available', 'woman', 'woman', 'extensive', 'sampling', 'tube', 'stics', 'stils', 'signature', 'undertaken', 'descriptive', 'statistic', 'compare', 'group', 'lesion', 'combined', 'prevalence', 'unique', 'tubal', 'lesion', 'invasive', 'serous', 'stics', 'stils', 'wa', 'wa', 'split', 'equally', 'brca', 'brca', 'carrier', 'diagnosis', 'invasive', 'wa', 'associated', 'older', 'age', 'risk', 'protective', 'factor', 'wa', 'significantly', 'associated', 'stics', 'stils', 'extensive', 'sampling', 'identified', 'double', 'number', 'stics', 'stils', 'signature', 'multiple', 'lesion', 'case', 'woman', 'signature', 'fimbria', 'older', 'woman', 'signature', 'remaining', 'tube', 'stics', 'stils', 'share', 'protective', 'factor', 'associated', 'hgsc', 'plausible', 'factor', 'associated', 'stics', 'progress', 'hgsc', 'multiple', 'lesion', 'fimbria', 'important', 'predictor', 'disease', 'progression', 'prev', 'aacr']",30232083,7,0.040697674418604654

Institutional ovarian cancer database was evaluated for compliance with the quality measure to administer chemotherapy within 42 days of cytoreductive surgery. The influence of chemotherapy timing on the risk of death was evaluated, and factors related to the timing of chemotherapy after surgery was assessed. Of 668 patients with epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer who underwent surgical treatment for their disease (primary or interval), 635 met criteria for administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (with stages IA/IB, grade 2 or 3 disease; stage IC or more advanced stage disease). Compliance to administer chemotherapy within 42 days was 59.1%. The adjusted risk of death was not strongly associated with time to chemotherapy within 42 days (aHR: 0.80; 0.61, 1.05) and this did not differ by primary or interval debulking surgery. In this prospectively maintained database, 59.1% of patients received chemotherapy within 42 days of surgery. The time to chemotherapy interval of within 42 days was not strongly associated with improved survival, particularly when age, stage of disease, insurance enrollment and surgical characteristics were taken into account.

Maintenance Olaparib in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Advanced Ovarian Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2018-10-21,"Most women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer have a relapse within 3 years after standard treatment with surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. The benefit of the oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib in relapsed disease has been well established, but the benefit of olaparib as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed disease is uncertain. We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV) high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian-tube cancer (or a combination thereof) with a mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or both ( BRCA1/2) who had a complete or partial clinical response after platinum-based chemotherapy. The patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Of the 391 patients who underwent randomization, 260 were assigned to receive olaparib and 131 to receive placebo. A total of 388 patients had a centrally confirmed germline BRCA1/2 mutation, and 2 patients had a centrally confirmed somatic BRCA1/2 mutation. After a median follow-up of 41 months, the risk of disease progression or death was 70% lower with olaparib than with placebo (Kaplan-Meier estimate of the rate of freedom from disease progression and from death at 3 years, 60% vs. 27%; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). Adverse events were consistent with the known toxic effects of olaparib. The use of maintenance therapy with olaparib provided a substantial benefit with regard to progression-free survival among women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation, with a 70% lower risk of disease progression or death with olaparib than with placebo.

"Disseminating universal genetic testing to a diverse, indigent patient population at a county hospital gynecologic oncology clinic.",Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2018-12-08,"The universal genetic testing initiative (UGTI) is a quality improvement effort to increase rates of guideline-based genetic counseling (GC) and genetic testing (GT) of patients with potentially hereditary cancers. The UGTI was disseminated to a county hospital gynecologic oncology clinic that serves a diverse, indigent patient population. Using the Model for Improvement quality improvement framework, interventions including integrated GC, clinic tracking, assisted GC referrals, and provider education were tested over 26 months. A retrospective data review included patients with high-grade, non-mucinous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers (HGOC) and endometrial cancers (EC) diagnosed between 9/1/12-8/31/16. Statistical analyses were performed to describe the population and to evaluate rates of recommendation and use of immunohistochemistry tumor testing (IHC), GC, and GT. A cohort of 241 patients (57 HGOC, 184 EC) were included. At the conclusion of the study 84.2% of HGOC patients were referred for GC, 89.6% (43/48) completed GC, and 90.7% (39/43) completed GT. Of EC patients, 81.0% were recommended to have IHC and 62.4% (93/149) completed IHC. Patients with HGOC diagnosed during dissemination of UGTI were significantly more likely to receive a recommendation for GC (p = 0.02) and to complete GT (p = 0.03) than those diagnosed before UGTI. Patients with EC were significantly more likely to complete IHC if diagnosed after UGTI than those diagnosed prior to dissemination (p < 0.001).

Using PARP Inhibitors in the Treatment of Patients With Ovarian Cancer.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2018-11-15,"Use of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors has greatly increased over the past 5 years. With several new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, three PARP inhibitors have entered into standard of care treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer (including ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer). Olaparib and rucaparib currently have indications for treatment of recurrent BRCA mutant ovarian cancer. Olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib all have indications for maintenance therapy in recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer after response to platinum-based therapy. In our practice, we use both olaparib and rucaparib in the recurrent setting, and all three PARP inhibitors in the maintenance setting. Choice of which PARP inhibitor to use in either setting is largely based upon baseline laboratory values, number of prior therapies, and presence of a BRCA mutation and/or homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). As (HRD) and other biomarker assessments continue to improve, we anticipate being able to better identify which patients might most benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy in the future. The clinically available PARP inhibitors are currently undergoing extensive investigations in clinical trials. Other newer agents such as talazoparib, veliparib, 2X-121, and CEP-9722 are in earlier stages of development.

Oncol.,2018-12-23,"Cabozantinib is a receptor tyrosine kinases inhibitor that targets MET (c-MET), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), RET, AXL, KIT, FLT-3, and TIE-2 and previously showed promising single agent activity in recurrent ovarian cancer. This was an open label, 1:1 randomized study of cabozantinib 60 mg orally (PO) daily versus weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given 3 out of 4 weeks (NCT01716715); 111 patients were enrolled. Eligibility included persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma and at least one but no >3 prior chemotherapy regimens. Median PFS was similar for both treatment groups and was 5.3 months for cabozantinib and 5.5 months for weekly paclitaxel (HR 1.11 (90% CI 0.77-1.61, p = 0.64)). Secondary analyses of overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) showed that cabozantinib did not perform as well as weekly paclitaxel. Median OS for cabozantinib was 19.4 months and was not reached for weekly paclitaxel (HR 2.27 (90% CI 1.17-4.41, p = 0.04). EFS was also worse in the cabozantinib arm, 3.5 months, compared to weekly paclitaxel at 5.0 months (HR 1.81 (90% CI 1.24-2.63, p = 0.01). Overall response rate (ORR) was less for cabozantinib compared to weekly paclitaxel (7% versus 24.1%).

Oncol.,2019-01-09,"To analyze the safety and efficacy of niraparib in patients aged ≥70 years with recurrent ovarian cancer in the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial. The trial enrolled 2 independent cohorts with histologically diagnosed recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer who responded to platinum rechallenge, on the basis of germline breast cancer susceptibility gene mutation (gBRCAmut) status. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. Adverse events (AEs) of special interest were based on the known safety profile of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. Patients aged ≥70 years in the gBRCAmut cohort receiving niraparib (n = 14) had not yet reached a median PFS compared with a median PFS of 3.7 months for the same age group in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01 to 0.73]). Non-gBRCAmut patients aged ≥70 years receiving niraparib (n = 47) had a median PFS of 11.3 months compared with 3.8 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.71]). Median duration of follow-up in the niraparib arm was 17.3 months in patients ≥70 years and 17.2 months in patients <70 years.

Ovarian cancer: screening and future directions.,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer,2019-01-01,"Ovarian cancer carries a lifetime risk of approximately 2% for women and is the leading cause of death from any gynecologic malignancy. Currently, no screening program for ovarian cancer exists for the general population in the UK. This review focuses on the evidence surrounding the efficacy of current markers and discusses future improvements in screening for this disease. One-off cancer antigen 125 (CA125) measurements for detecting ovarian cancer have been well researched. However, studies have highlighted low positive predictive values (5%) and high false positive rates leading to patient anxiety and unnecessary invasive follow-up. Commonly, in the UK, CA125 is combined with transvaginal ultrasound, but there is little evidence that this approach can decrease mortality from ovarian cancer. Recently the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm, involving a combination of serial CA125 measurements and age, has been shown to detect more early stage cancers. Nevertheless, these measures are not robust in decreasing mortality from ovarian cancer and are costly to implement. Newer markers, such as human epididymis protein 4, have shown greater specificity. Its combination with CA125 and menopausal status in the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm can predict the risk of malignancy but provides no additional benefit as a screening tool. Advanced techniques are emerging, including ultrasound molecular imaging techniques using microbubbles targeted to kinase domain receptors, and fallopian tube cytology. To reduce mortality from ovarian cancer, detection of pre-invasive lesions is imperative as ovarian cancer may develop in the fallopian tube and spread to the peritoneal cavity before being detected systemically. It seems that screening tools for ovarian cancer are currently not worthwhile for implementation into a national program.

Constitutively active ESR1 mutations in gynecologic malignancies and clinical response to estrogen-receptor directed therapies.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-04-13,"Endocrine therapy is often considered as a treatment for hormone-responsive gynecologic malignancies. In breast cancer, activating mutations in the estrogen receptor (mutESR1) contribute to therapeutic resistance to endocrine therapy, especially aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and clinical relevance of ESR1 genomic alterations in gynecologic malignancies. DNA from FFPE tumor tissue obtained during routine clinical care for 9645 gynecologic malignancies (ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, vagina, vulvar, and placenta) was analyzed for all classes of genomic alterations (base substitutions (muts), insertions, deletions, rearrangements, and amplifications) in ESR1 by hybrid capture next generation sequencing. A subset of alterations was characterized in laboratory-based transcription assays for response to endocrine therapies. A total of 295 ESR1 genomic alterations were identified in 285 (3.0%) cases. mutESR1 were present in 86 (0.9%) cases and were more common in uterine compared to other cancers (2.0% vs <1%, respectively p < 0.001). mutESR1 were enriched in carcinomas with endometrioid versus serous histology (4.4% vs 0.2% respectively, p < 0.0001 in uterine and 3.5% vs 0.3% respectively, p = 0.0004 in ovarian carcinomas). In three of four patients with serial sampling, mutESR1 emerged under the selective pressure of AI therapy. Despite decreased potency of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists in transcriptional assays, clinical benefit was observed following treatment with selective ER-targeted therapy, in one case lasting >48 months.

Brain metastasis in epithelial ovarian cancer by BRCA1/2 mutation status.,Gynecologic oncology,Gynecol. Oncol.,2019-05-18,"To evaluate clinical outcomes of patients with BRCA-associated ovarian cancer who developed brain metastases (BM). Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) and BM, treated at a single institution from 1/1/2008-7/1/2018, were identified from two institutional databases. Charts and medical records were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics and germline BRCA mutation status. Appropriate statistics were used. Of 3649 patients with EOC, 91 had BM (2.5%). Germline mutation status was available for 63 (69%) cases; 21 (35%) of these harbored a BRCA1/2 mutation (15 BRCA1, 6 BRCA2). Clinical characteristics were similar between groups. BM were diagnosed at a median of 31 months (95% CI, 22.6-39.4) in BRCA-mutated (mBRCA) and 32 months (95% CI, 23.7-40.3) in wild-type BRCA (wtBRCA) (p = 0.78) patients. Brain metastases were the only evidence of disease at time of BM diagnoses in 48% (n = 10) mBRCA and 19% (n = 8) wtBRCA (p = 0.02) patients. There was no difference in treatment of BM by mutation status (p = 0.84). Survival from time of BM diagnosis was 29 months (95%CI, 15.5-42.5) in mBRCA and 9 months (95% CI, 5.5-12.5) in wtBRCA patients, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53, p = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.25-1.11. HR was adjusted for presence of systemic disease at time of BM diagnosis. This is the largest study to date comparing outcomes in patients with EOC and BM by mutation status. mBRCA patients were more likely to have isolated BM, which may be a factor in their long survival.

Secondary Surgical Cytoreduction for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2019-11-01,"Secondary surgical cytoreduction in women with platinum-sensitive, recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian-tube (""ovarian"") cancer is widely practiced but has not been evaluated in phase 3 investigation. We randomly assigned patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had received one previous therapy, had an interval during which no platinum-based chemotherapy was used (platinum-free interval) of 6 months or more, and had investigator-determined resectable disease (to no macroscopic residual disease) to undergo secondary surgical cytoreduction and then receive platinum-based chemotherapy or to receive platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Adjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel-carboplatin or gemcitabine-carboplatin) and use of bevacizumab were at the discretion of the investigator. The primary end point was overall survival. A total of 485 patients underwent randomization, 240 to secondary cytoreduction before chemotherapy and 245 to chemotherapy alone. The median follow-up was 48.1 months. Complete gross resection was achieved in 67% of the patients assigned to surgery who underwent the procedure. Platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance was administered to 84% of the patients overall and was equally distributed between the two groups. The hazard ratio for death (surgery vs. no surgery) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.72; P = 0.08), which corresponded to a median overall survival of 50.6 months and 64.7 months, respectively. Adjustment for platinum-free interval and chemotherapy choice did not alter the effect. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death (surgery vs. no surgery) was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.01; median progression-free survival, 18.9 months and 16.2 months, respectively). Surgical morbidity at 30 days was 9%; 1 patient (0.4%) died from postoperative complications.
