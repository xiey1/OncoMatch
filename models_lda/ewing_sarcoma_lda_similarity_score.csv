Core biopsies can be used to distinguish differences in expression profiling by cDNA microarrays.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2002-02-01,"The primary focus of this work was to determine the feasibility of obtaining representative expression array profiles from clinical core biopsies. For this purpose we performed six 16-gauge needle core biopsies and an excision biopsy on each of two different human xenografts, one from an Ewing's sarcoma cell line and the second from neuroblastoma cell line grown in Beige-Scid mice. Three of the six core biopsies were processed separately and the remaining three were pooled and processed together. As the initial RNA material isolated from the core biopsies was not sufficient for microarray analysis, an amplification procedure using a modified Eberwine protocol was performed, and the amplified products applied onto a 6000-feature human cDNA microarray. Comparisons of the array results from core biopsies (amplified RNA) and surgical specimens (non-amplified RNA) showed maintenance of the expression profile as assessed by hierarchical clustering. Gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis clearly differentiated the Ewing's sarcoma from the neuroblastoma with both core and excisional biopsies as starting material. Pooling the core biopsies did not improve the concordance with excisional biopsies. In conclusion, our results suggest that core biopsies can be used as a suitable and reliable material for the determination of tumor genetic profiles.",Comparative Study,6563.0,40.0,The primary focus of this work was to determine the feasibility of obtaining representative expression array profiles from clinical core biopsies For this purpose we performed six 16-gauge needle core biopsies and an excision biopsy on each of two different human xenografts one from an 's cell line and the second from cell line grown in Beige-Scid mice Three of the six core biopsies were processed separately and the remaining three were pooled and processed together As the initial RNA material isolated from the core biopsies was not sufficient for microarray analysis an amplification procedure using a modified Eberwine protocol was performed and the amplified products applied onto a 6000-feature human cDNA microarray Comparisons of the array results from core biopsies amplified RNA and surgical specimens non-amplified RNA showed maintenance of the expression profile as assessed by hierarchical clustering Gene expression profiles obtained from microarray analysis clearly differentiated the 's from the with both core and excisional biopsies as starting material Pooling the core biopsies did not improve the concordance with excisional biopsies In conclusion our results suggest that core biopsies can be used as a suitable and reliable material for the determination of tumor genetic profiles,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 86, 1222, 1, 26, 1357, 10, 6, 223, 3, 1437, 1, 5244, 3724, 55, 1926, 1241, 29, 38, 1793, 1154, 9, 26, 743, 21, 173, 437, 245, 10145, 2177, 1793, 1154, 2, 35, 1366, 411, 23, 296, 1, 100, 338, 171, 1348, 104, 29, 35, 292, 31, 328, 2, 3, 419, 29, 31, 328, 5473, 4, 16620, 4129, 399, 169, 1, 3, 437, 1793, 1154, 11, 5232, 3582, 2, 3, 1844, 169, 11, 1830, 2, 5232, 1162, 22, 3, 388, 893, 3692, 1355, 29, 3, 1793, 1154, 10, 44, 1952, 9, 1727, 65, 35, 1073, 1299, 75, 8, 1230, 42837, 1182, 10, 173, 2, 3, 2429, 2766, 1498, 3301, 8, 16187, 2705, 171, 4212, 1727, 2213, 1, 3, 1926, 99, 29, 1793, 1154, 2429, 893, 2, 221, 623, 220, 2429, 893, 224, 1146, 1, 3, 55, 800, 22, 275, 20, 4466, 3147, 145, 55, 1241, 683, 29, 1727, 65, 2536, 1442, 3, 292, 29, 3, 5, 110, 1793, 2, 6488, 1154, 22, 1723, 3692, 9419, 3, 1793, 1154, 205, 44, 401, 3, 1827, 5, 6488, 1154, 4, 1221, 114, 99, 309, 17, 1793, 1154, 122, 40, 95, 22, 8, 2884, 2, 2450, 3692, 9, 3, 3104, 1, 30, 336, 1241]",1307.0,"['primary', 'focus', 'work', 'wa', 'determine', 'feasibility', 'obtaining', 'representative', 'expression', 'array', 'profile', 'clinical', 'core', 'biopsy', 'purpose', 'performed', 'gauge', 'needle', 'core', 'biopsy', 'excision', 'biopsy', 'different', 'human', 'xenograft', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'second', 'neuroblastoma', 'line', 'grown', 'beige', 'scid', 'mouse', 'core', 'biopsy', 'processed', 'separately', 'remaining', 'pooled', 'processed', 'initial', 'rna', 'material', 'isolated', 'core', 'biopsy', 'wa', 'sufficient', 'microarray', 'amplification', 'procedure', 'modified', 'eberwine', 'protocol', 'wa', 'performed', 'amplified', 'product', 'applied', 'feature', 'human', 'cdna', 'microarray', 'comparison', 'array', 'core', 'biopsy', 'amplified', 'rna', 'surgical', 'specimen', 'non', 'amplified', 'rna', 'showed', 'maintenance', 'expression', 'profile', 'assessed', 'hierarchical', 'clustering', 'expression', 'profile', 'obtained', 'microarray', 'clearly', 'differentiated', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'neuroblastoma', 'core', 'excisional', 'biopsy', 'starting', 'material', 'pooling', 'core', 'biopsy', 'improve', 'concordance', 'excisional', 'biopsy', 'suggest', 'core', 'biopsy', 'suitable', 'reliable', 'material', 'determination', 'genetic', 'profile']",11826185,5,0.02304147465437788
C-kit expression in pediatric solid tumors: a comparative immunohistochemical study.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2002-04-01,"The stem cell factor/c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor pathway has been shown to be important for tumor growth and progression in several cancers, including mast cell diseases, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, small cell lung carcinoma, and Ewing sarcoma.

With the aim of identifying additional groups of tumors that may use the stem cell factor/c-kit pathway and secondarily may be responsive to STI-571 treatment, this study surveyed 151 primary tumors from patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for immunohistochemical expression of c-kit. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-human c-kit (CD117, Dako) using standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique, antigen retrieval, and an automated stainer. Strong, diffuse staining for c-kit was seen in a proportion of synovial sarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing sarcomas. Strong, diffuse staining was less common in neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas and was negative in alveolar soft part sarcomas and desmoplastic small round cell tumors.

Addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to standard chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2003-02-01,"Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone are closely related, highly malignant tumors of children, adolescents, and young adults. A new drug combination, ifosfamide and etoposide, was highly effective in patients with Ewing's sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone who had a relapse after standard therapy. We designed a study to test whether the addition of these drugs to a standard regimen would improve the survival of patients with newly diagnosed disease. Patients 30 years old or younger with Ewing's sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone, or primitive sarcoma of bone were eligible. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 49 weeks of standard chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin or experimental therapy with these four drugs alternating with courses of ifosfamide and etoposide. A total of 518 patients met the eligibility requirements. Of 120 patients with metastatic disease, 62 were randomly assigned to the standard-therapy group and 58 to the experimental-therapy group.

Treatment of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors: current status and outlook for the future.,Medical and pediatric oncology,Med. Pediatr. Oncol.,2003-05-01,"The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) comprises a group of well-characterized neoplasms with aggressive behavior. Despite significant progress with the use of intensive multiagent chemotherapy and local control measures, a significant proportion of patients die of disease progression. Chemotherapy dose intensification and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have been explored by many institutions without obvious benefit in high-risk patients. Our current understanding in the biology and treatment of ESFT suggests that a more rational approach to the development of risk-adapted therapy should be undertaken. We performed a review of the most relevant data regarding the current status in the treatment of ESFT. The results of the major American and European cooperative groups were analyzed, including the treatment strategies used and the prognostic factors identified for both localized and metastatic ESFT. The intensification of alkylating agents and topoisomerase-II inhibitors is feasible and has resulted in some survival improvement for selected patients. This benefit seems to be restricted to patients with localized disease, and a proportion of survivors are at risk of developing treatment-related hematologic malignancies. Nevertheless, these advances have resulted in a re-definition of prognostic factors, which may help to define risk groups based on tumor load parameters as well as biologic factors (type of fusion transcript and histologic response to chemotherapy). Patients with advanced metastatic disease may benefit from HSCT. New strategies such as immunotherapy and the use of biologic modifiers may have a role in the treatment of ESFT.

The long-term follow-up study of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a multiinstitutional cohort study comprising 14,054 individuals who have survived for 5 or more years after treatment for cancer diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. Baseline demographic and medical information were obtained. Six hundred ninety-four survivors had osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma of the lower extremity or pelvis and were classified by amputation status and by age at diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 14 years old with a median of 16 years of follow up since diagnosis. Demographic characteristics were used to analyze the rates of psychosocial outcomes. Amputation status and age at diagnosis did not significantly influence any of the measured psychosocial outcomes. Education was a significant positive predictor of employment, having health insurance, and being currently in their first marriage. Male gender predicted ever being employed and female gender predicted having health insurance and marriage. When compared with siblings, amputees had significant deficits in education, employment, and health insurance. Overall, no differences between amputees and nonamputees were found.

Osteogenic and Ewing sarcomas: estimation of necrotic fraction during induction chemotherapy with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging.,Radiology,Radiology,2003-07-01,"Dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images of primary osteogenic sarcoma (n = 19) and Ewing sarcoma (n = 10) were reviewed in 29 patients undergoing induction chemotherapy before surgery. Histogram distributions containing the initial slope and pharmacokinetic model parameters from individual voxels within each tumor were fitted for each patient.

Genomic structure and mutational analysis of the human KIF1Balpha gene located at 1p36.2 in neuroblastoma.,International journal of oncology,Int. J. Oncol.,2003-09-01,"KIF1a is a member of the kinesin superfamily proteins that are microtubule-dependent molecular motors involved in important intracellular functions such as organelle transport and cell division. We previously determined the structure of the human KIF1Bbeta gene, which was found to be a homologue of the murine Kif1bbeta, and demonstrated that the human KIF1Bbeta is a causative gene of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A although we did not prove that it is a tumor suppressor gene of neuroblastoma. Here, we identified another isoform of the human KIF1B gene, KIF1Balpha. The KIF1Balpha and KIF1Bbeta are alternative splicing products of the KIF1B gene located on 1p36.2. The KIF1Balpha is distinct from KIF1Bbeta in the C-terminal cargo-binding domain; however, they have the same N-terminal motor domain. We found that the transcript of approximately 7.8 kb of KIF1Balpha was expressed in several tissues, especially in skeletal muscle, by Northern blot analysis. To determine whether this gene is one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes for neuroblastoma (NB) or other pediatric solid tumors, we performed mutational screening of KIF1Balpha in 25 NB, 9 rhabdomyosarcoma, 12 Ewing sarcoma and 24 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines. Using RT-PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing we detected a missense mutation (M807I) in 1 NB cell line (SK-N-SH), 3 silent mutations in 2 NB cell lines and 1 primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell line, respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed that KIF1Balpha was obviously expressed in almost all of the tumor cell lines examined except NB-1. Furthermore, real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was no significant difference in KIF1Balpha expression between 14 early-stage (stage I and II) and 14 advanced-stage (stage III and IV) NB fresh tumor specimens.

Phase I trial of temozolomide and protracted irinotecan in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2004-02-01,"The purpose is to estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide and irinotecan given on a protracted schedule in 28-day courses to pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors. Twelve heavily pretreated patients received 56 courses of oral temozolomide at 100 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days combined with i.v. irinotecan given daily for 5 days for 2 consecutive weeks at either 10 mg/m(2)/day (n = 6) or 15 mg/m(2)/day (n = 6). We assessed toxicity, the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide and irinotecan, and the DNA repair phenotype in tumor samples. Two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the higher dose level; one had grade 4 diarrhea, whereas the other had bacteremia with grade 2 neutropenia. In contrast, no patient receiving temozolomide and 10 mg/m(2)/day irinotecan experienced DLT. Myelosuppression was minimal and noncumulative. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. Drug metabolite exposures at the MTD were similar to exposures previously associated with single-agent antitumor activity. One complete response, two partial responses, and one minor response were observed in Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma patients previously treated with stem cell transplant. Responding patients had low or absent O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression in tumor tissue. The MTD using this schedule was temozolomide (100 mg/m(2)/day) and irinotecan (10 mg/m(2)/day), with DLT being diarrhea and infection.

High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue for pediatric sarcomas.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2004-03-01,"The principal pediatric sarcomas are Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. While the prognosis for these diseases is generally favorable, it is possible to identify groups of patients with each diagnosis whose prognosis remains unacceptably poor. Based on the chemotherapy sensitivity of these tumors, many investigators have suggested that consolidation with high dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy followed by stem cell rescue could improve the prognosis for these high risk patients. This review evaluates the results of high dose therapy with stem cell reconstitution used to consolidate treatment of high risk patients with sarcomas. The majority of the trials which have been conducted to assess this hypothesis have treated relatively small numbers of patients. They do not use consistent definitions of high risk. They have used different regimens for cytoreduction. They have used a variety of sources for stem cells. In many series, the consolidation therapy is applied only to patients who have achieved a significant response to prior therapy and the results have then been compared to a cohort of patients with similar presenting features, not all of whom responded to initial therapy. The published results do not demonstrate an unequivocal benefit for consolidation with high-dose therapy. Future trials of high-dose therapy must define rigorous eligibility criteria, must have an appropriate, preferably randomized, control group, and must be designed with sufficient power to evaluate the hypothesis.",Journal Article,5804.0,41.0,The principal pediatric sarcomas are and While the prognosis for these diseases is generally favorable it is possible to identify groups of patients with each diagnosis whose prognosis remains unacceptably poor Based on the chemotherapy sensitivity of these tumors many investigators have suggested that consolidation with high dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy followed by stem cell rescue could improve the prognosis for these high risk patients This review evaluates the results of high dose therapy with stem cell reconstitution used to consolidate treatment of high risk patients with sarcomas The majority of the trials which have been conducted to assess this hypothesis have treated relatively small numbers of patients They do not use consistent definitions of high risk They have used different regimens for cytoreduction They have used a variety of sources for stem cells In many series the consolidation therapy is applied only to patients who have achieved a significant response to prior therapy and the results have then been compared to a cohort of patients with similar presenting features not all of whom responded to initial therapy The published results do not demonstrate an unequivocal benefit for consolidation with high-dose therapy Future trials of high-dose therapy must define rigorous eligibility criteria must have an appropriate preferably randomized control group and must be designed with sufficient power to evaluate the hypothesis,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 4312, 815, 1479, 32, 2, 369, 3, 356, 9, 46, 1342, 16, 1228, 913, 192, 16, 899, 6, 255, 271, 1, 7, 5, 296, 147, 1310, 356, 469, 11934, 334, 90, 23, 3, 56, 485, 1, 46, 57, 445, 2394, 47, 1148, 17, 2173, 5, 64, 61, 56, 5, 15, 187, 121, 36, 370, 20, 452, 31, 4256, 359, 401, 3, 356, 9, 46, 64, 43, 7, 26, 206, 4941, 3, 99, 1, 64, 61, 36, 5, 452, 31, 5616, 95, 6, 16671, 24, 1, 64, 43, 7, 5, 1479, 3, 686, 1, 3, 143, 92, 47, 85, 426, 6, 423, 26, 1492, 47, 73, 1352, 302, 1870, 1, 7, 491, 1022, 44, 119, 925, 3833, 1, 64, 43, 491, 47, 95, 338, 472, 9, 2844, 491, 47, 95, 8, 1362, 1, 3375, 9, 452, 37, 4, 445, 988, 3, 2173, 36, 16, 1498, 158, 6, 7, 54, 47, 513, 8, 93, 51, 6, 324, 36, 2, 3, 99, 47, 818, 85, 72, 6, 8, 180, 1, 7, 5, 288, 1656, 404, 44, 62, 1, 953, 2211, 6, 388, 36, 3, 983, 99, 1022, 44, 608, 35, 14775, 247, 9, 2173, 5, 64, 61, 36, 508, 143, 1, 64, 61, 36, 1642, 1107, 6496, 2317, 371, 1642, 47, 35, 870, 10590, 384, 182, 87, 2, 1642, 40, 1114, 5, 1952, 2349, 6, 376, 3, 1492]",1482.0,"['principal', 'pediatric', 'sarcoma', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'osteosarcoma', 'prognosis', 'disease', 'generally', 'favorable', 'possible', 'identify', 'group', 'patient', 'diagnosis', 'prognosis', 'remains', 'unacceptably', 'poor', 'based', 'chemotherapy', 'sensitivity', 'investigator', 'suggested', 'consolidation', 'high', 'dose', 'chemotherapy', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'followed', 'stem', 'rescue', 'improve', 'prognosis', 'high', 'risk', 'patient', 'review', 'evaluates', 'high', 'dose', 'therapy', 'stem', 'reconstitution', 'consolidate', 'treatment', 'high', 'risk', 'patient', 'sarcoma', 'majority', 'trial', 'conducted', 'ass', 'hypothesis', 'treated', 'relatively', 'small', 'number', 'patient', 'use', 'consistent', 'definition', 'high', 'risk', 'different', 'regimen', 'cytoreduction', 'variety', 'source', 'stem', 'series', 'consolidation', 'therapy', 'applied', 'patient', 'achieved', 'significant', 'response', 'prior', 'therapy', 'compared', 'cohort', 'patient', 'similar', 'presenting', 'feature', 'responded', 'initial', 'therapy', 'published', 'demonstrate', 'unequivocal', 'benefit', 'consolidation', 'high', 'dose', 'therapy', 'future', 'trial', 'high', 'dose', 'therapy', 'define', 'rigorous', 'eligibility', 'criterion', 'appropriate', 'preferably', 'randomized', 'control', 'group', 'designed', 'sufficient', 'power', 'evaluate', 'hypothesis']",15075902,20,0.09216589861751152

Thirty-two patients had metastases to lungs only, 12 patients had metastases to bone marrow or bones only, 64 patients had metastases in multiple sites, and five patients had metastases in other sites; seven patients could not be assessed precisely. Treatment comprised 9 weeks of chemotherapy before local control and 42 weeks of chemotherapy; thereafter, regimen A consisted of vincristine 2 mg/m(2), cyclophosphamide 1,200 mg/m(2), and either doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) or dactinomycin 1.25 mg/m(2).

Divergent patterns of telomere maintenance mechanisms among human sarcomas: sharply contrasting prevalence of the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism in Ewing's sarcomas and osteosarcomas.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2004-10-01,"Two types of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) have been described in human tumors: telomerase activation and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Although the vast majority of epithelial tumors rely on telomerase activation, many mesenchymal tumors rely on ALT for telomere maintenance, but within this tumor group, the TMMs used by translocation-associated sarcomas have not been systematically studied. We studied telomere lengths and telomerase expression and activity in 30 uncultured tumor samples and in 10 cell lines of Ewing's sarcoma, a prototypical translocation-associated sarcoma, and compared the data to an identical analysis of 60 osteosarcomas, the most common type of sarcoma lacking a specific translocation. Telomerase activity was demonstrated in 21 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples (70%) and in 9 of 10 Ewing's sarcoma cell lines. Evidence of ALT, indicated by the presence of long and heterogeneous telomeres, was observed only in the cell line without telomerase activity and in none of the 30 Ewing's sarcoma tumor samples. The 9 Ewing's sarcoma patients whose tumors lacked detectable telomerase activity did not differ significantly from the remaining patients in age, stage, EWSR1-FLI1 fusion type, prevalence of TP53 point mutations, or overall survival. The low prevalence of ALT in Ewing's sarcoma contrasted sharply with our data on TMMs in 60 osteosarcomas, which showed ALT in 38 of 60 cases (P<0.0001). The present study, together with emerging published data on other sarcoma types, suggests that a predominance of telomerase activation in the absence of ALT may characterize sarcomas with specific chromosomal translocations (such as Ewing's sarcoma), whereas a high prevalence of ALT appears typical of sarcomas with nonspecific complex karyotypes (such as osteosarcoma).",Journal Article,5590.0,72.0,Two types of telomere maintenance mechanisms TMMs have been described in human tumors telomerase activation and alternative lengthening of telomeres ALT Although the vast majority of epithelial tumors rely on telomerase activation many mesenchymal tumors rely on ALT for telomere maintenance but within this tumor group the TMMs used by translocation-associated sarcomas have not been systematically studied We studied telomere lengths and telomerase expression and activity in 30 uncultured tumor samples and in 10 cell lines of 's a prototypical translocation-associated and compared the data to an identical analysis of 60 osteosarcomas the most common type of lacking a specific translocation Telomerase activity was demonstrated in 21 's tumor samples 70 and in 9 of 10 's cell lines Evidence of ALT indicated by the presence of long and heterogeneous telomeres was observed only in the cell line without telomerase activity and in none of the 30 's tumor samples The 9 's patients whose tumors lacked detectable telomerase activity did not differ significantly from the remaining patients in age stage EWSR1-FLI1 fusion type prevalence of TP53 point mutations or overall survival The low prevalence of ALT in 's contrasted sharply with our data on TMMs in 60 osteosarcomas which showed ALT in 38 of 60 cases P 0.0001 The present study together with emerging published data on other types suggests that a predominance of telomerase activation in the absence of ALT may characterize sarcomas with specific chromosomal translocations such as 's whereas a high prevalence of ALT appears typical of sarcomas with nonspecific complex karyotypes such as,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[100, 630, 1, 4136, 1146, 483, 24603, 47, 85, 1027, 4, 171, 57, 3916, 363, 2, 1091, 13048, 1, 7220, 4548, 242, 3, 4337, 686, 1, 701, 57, 5533, 23, 3916, 363, 445, 1569, 57, 5533, 23, 4548, 9, 4136, 1146, 84, 262, 26, 30, 87, 3, 24603, 95, 20, 2006, 41, 1479, 47, 44, 85, 3390, 656, 21, 656, 4136, 7443, 2, 3916, 55, 2, 128, 4, 201, 27929, 30, 347, 2, 4, 79, 31, 285, 1, 292, 8, 14216, 2006, 41, 2, 72, 3, 74, 6, 35, 3038, 65, 1, 335, 11089, 3, 96, 186, 267, 1, 1941, 8, 112, 2006, 3916, 128, 10, 264, 4, 239, 292, 30, 347, 431, 2, 4, 83, 1, 79, 292, 31, 285, 241, 1, 4548, 1103, 20, 3, 463, 1, 319, 2, 1564, 7220, 10, 164, 158, 4, 3, 31, 328, 187, 3916, 128, 2, 4, 1292, 1, 3, 201, 292, 30, 347, 3, 83, 292, 7, 1310, 57, 5005, 2083, 3916, 128, 205, 44, 1505, 97, 29, 3, 1844, 7, 4, 89, 82, 6620, 8327, 1212, 267, 1078, 1, 1206, 741, 138, 15, 63, 25, 3, 154, 1078, 1, 4548, 4, 292, 13257, 10833, 5, 114, 74, 23, 24603, 4, 335, 11089, 92, 224, 4548, 4, 519, 1, 335, 140, 19, 13, 488, 3, 364, 45, 1162, 5, 1478, 983, 74, 23, 127, 630, 844, 17, 8, 7593, 1, 3916, 363, 4, 3, 1127, 1, 4548, 68, 1507, 1479, 5, 112, 1860, 3262, 225, 22, 292, 547, 8, 64, 1078, 1, 4548, 1233, 3476, 1, 1479, 5, 5893, 840, 6809, 225, 22]",1652.0,"['type', 'telomere', 'maintenance', 'mechanism', 'tmms', 'described', 'human', 'telomerase', 'activation', 'alternative', 'lengthening', 'telomere', 'alt', 'vast', 'majority', 'epithelial', 'rely', 'telomerase', 'activation', 'mesenchymal', 'rely', 'alt', 'telomere', 'maintenance', 'group', 'tmms', 'translocation', 'associated', 'sarcoma', 'systematically', 'studied', 'studied', 'telomere', 'length', 'telomerase', 'expression', 'activity', 'uncultured', 'line', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'prototypical', 'translocation', 'associated', 'sarcoma', 'compared', 'identical', 'osteosarcoma', 'common', 'type', 'sarcoma', 'lacking', 'specific', 'translocation', 'telomerase', 'activity', 'wa', 'demonstrated', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'evidence', 'alt', 'indicated', 'presence', 'long', 'heterogeneous', 'telomere', 'wa', 'observed', 'line', 'telomerase', 'activity', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'patient', 'lacked', 'detectable', 'telomerase', 'activity', 'differ', 'significantly', 'remaining', 'patient', 'age', 'stage', 'ewsr', 'fli', 'fusion', 'type', 'prevalence', 'tp', 'point', 'overall', 'survival', 'low', 'prevalence', 'alt', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'contrasted', 'sharply', 'tmms', 'osteosarcoma', 'showed', 'alt', 'case', 'present', 'emerging', 'published', 'sarcoma', 'type', 'suggests', 'predominance', 'telomerase', 'activation', 'absence', 'alt', 'characterize', 'sarcoma', 'specific', 'chromosomal', 'translocation', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'high', 'prevalence', 'alt', 'appears', 'typical', 'sarcoma', 'nonspecific', 'complex', 'karyotype', 'osteosarcoma']",15287028,4,0.018433179723502304

Phys.,2004-11-01,"To assess the effect of radiation dose on local tumor control of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors in 79 patients with localized disease treated at a single institution. Thirty-seven patients received vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, and 42 received vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide, with alternating cycles of ifosfamide and etoposide; all underwent definitive radiotherapy (median dose, 37.5 Gy) with either low-dose (<40 Gy) or standard dose (> or =40 Gy) radiation delivered according to the protocol. We calculated the cumulative incidence of local treatment failure, disease recurrence, and overall survival and analyzed the effect of known prognostic factors and radiation dose. The cumulative incidence of local treatment failure at 10 years was 30.4% and that of disease recurrence was 40%. The overall survival rate was 64.5%. Patient age > or =14 years and tumor size > or =8 cm were adverse prognostic factors for local treatment failure; patient age > or =14 years was also associated with worse survival. Although the radiation dose alone did not predict for local treatment failure, the cumulative incidence of local failure at 10 years was 19% when tumors <8 cm were treated with <40 Gy, and no patient treated with standard doses (> or =40 Gy) developed local recurrence (p = 0.084).

Ewing sarcomas with p53 mutation or p16/p14ARF homozygous deletion: a highly lethal subset associated with poor chemoresponse.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-01-01,"EWS-FLI1 fusion type, p53 mutation, and homozygous deletion of p16/p14ARF have each been shown to be prognostically significant in Ewing sarcoma (ES). We provide the first combined prognostic analysis of these three molecular parameters in ES. We studied 60 patients with ES (stage: localized in 54, metastatic in six). All cases were confirmed to contain the EWS-FLI1 (29 type 1, 12 type 2, 14 other types) or EWS-ERG fusions (five cases). Homozygous deletion of p16/p14ARF, and p53 mutations were determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) p53 GeneChip microarray hybridization, respectively. Eight cases (13.3%) contained point mutations of p53, and eight cases (13.3%) showed p16/p14ARF deletion, including one case with both alterations. Among 32 cases with data on histologic chemoresponse, all 10 with alterations in p53 or p16/p14ARF showed a poor chemoresponse (P = .03). Variables predicting poorer overall survival included p53 mutation alone (P < .001), either p53 or p16/p14ARF alteration (P < .001), and stage (P < .01). In multivariate analysis, alterations of p53 and/or p16/p14ARF as a single variable, was the most adverse prognostic factor (P < .001), followed by stage (P = .04). In a multivariate analysis with alterations of p53 and p16/p14ARF as separate variables, both were significant (P < .001 and P = .03, respectively). Six cases with p16/p14ARF deletion were also studied for co-deletion of the contiguous methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene, and this was detected in four cases.

Advanced-technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcomas.,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,Cancer Control,,"For patients with sarcomas, radiotherapy can be used as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or primary local therapy, depending on the site and type of sarcoma, the surgical approach, and the efficacy of chemotherapy. The authors review the current status of advanced technology radiation therapy in the management of bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Advances in radiotherapy have resulted in improved treatment for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses modifications in the intensity of the photon-beam from a linear accelerator across the irradiated fields to enhance dose conformation in three dimensions. For proton-beam radiation therapy, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are accelerated in cyclotrons or synchrotrons, extracted, and transported to treatment rooms where the proton beam undergoes a series of modifications that conform the dose in a particular patient to the tumor target. Brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation therapy have generally been used to treat microscopic residual disease in patients with sarcomas. These technologies deliver dose to tumor cells with irradiation of limited volumes of normal tissue. Patients who may benefit from technically advanced radiotherapy include those with skull base and spine/paraspinal sarcomas, Ewing's sarcoma, and retroperitoneal/extremity sarcomas.

A multicenter Phase II study of bortezomib in recurrent or metastatic sarcomas.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-04-01,"Based on evidence of activity in preclinical and Phase I studies, the authors undertook a study of bortezomib, a reversible proteasome inhibitor, for patients with metastatic sarcomas. Two arms were opened, each using a Simon two-stage design. Arm A included patients with osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Arm B accrued patients with other types of soft tissue sarcomas. Patients were not allowed to have received previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The initial dose of bortezomib was a 1.5 mg/m2 intravenous push twice weekly followed by a rest week. The dose was escalated to 1.7 mg/m2 if patients tolerated Cycle 1 well. The dose escalation was eliminated due to toxicity observed in the first six patients. Painful neuropathy, myalgias, and asthenia were the most significant observed toxicities. The most frequent toxicities included fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. Pharmacodynamic data from 18 patients with complete data collection did not show consistent differences between patients with or without Grade 2 or Grade 3 neuropathy (toxicity graded according the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria).

Overview of sarcomas in the adolescent and young adult population.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2005-04-01,"Based on the data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Section of the National Cancer Institute (SEER) program, soft tissue and bone sarcomas account for about 1% of all new malignancies diagnosed in the United States each year. However, there are numerous different histologic types, and any given type of sarcoma is extremely rare. Determining the incidence of sarcomas by age and type is difficult due to the limited data reported. The SEER program collects data regarding age but only limited data on histology, while most series reported in the literature include either adults or pediatric patients, but rarely both. In an effort to estimate the frequency and absolute numbers of different sarcomas in the adolescent and young adult population, the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) tumor registry was queried for all soft tissue sarcomas from 1990 through 2003, and all bone sarcomas from 1990 through 2002. Based on this query, an overview of sarcomas that occur predominantly in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population is presented. These sarcomas include rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma, epithelioid sarcomas, alveolar soft parts sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Using the percentages for occurrence of each histologic type determined from the MDACC database, and the SEER estimate of overall sarcoma incidence, an estimate of the number of new cases in 2004 for the predominant histologic types occurring in the AYA population are presented.

Aberrations of the CHK2 gene are rare in pediatric solid tumors.,International journal of molecular medicine,Int. J. Mol. Med.,2005-07-01,"In pediatric solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma (NB), it has been reported that the frequency of TP53 gene alterations is lower than that in adult tumors, suggesting that other tumor suppressor genes may play more important roles in the development of pediatric solid tumors. The CHK2 gene, whose product is a checkpoint kinase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and acts upstream of TP53, has been found to be mutated in a subset of Li-Fraumeni syndrome without mutations of TP53 and in some other sporadic human tumors, earmarking this serine/threonine kinase as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Thus, we analyzed the CHK2 gene to address whether it is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for pediatric solid tumors. We screened for mutations of the CHK2 gene in 25 NB, 8 rhbdomyosarcoma, 12 Ewing sarcoma, and 26 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines as well as 77 fresh tumors including two cases of multiple cancers. Using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-SSCP followed by direct sequence analysis, we detected only one missense mutation (S505T) in one NB cell line and two silent mutations in one NB cell line and one NB fresh tumor, respectively. Through RT-PCR and subcloning analysis, we detected a similar expression of the CHK2 gene in all of the NB cell lines and fresh tumors; however, we identified at least three isoforms of the CHK2 gene, two of which have not been reported previously. These results suggest that aberrations of the CHK2 gene are rare in pediatric solid tumors.",Journal Article,5317.0,6.0,In pediatric solid tumors such as NB it has been reported that the frequency of TP53 gene alterations is lower than that in adult tumors suggesting that other tumor suppressor genes may play more important roles in the development of pediatric solid tumors The CHK2 gene whose product is a checkpoint kinase that plays a central role in DNA damage response and acts upstream of TP53 has been found to be mutated in a subset of Li-Fraumeni syndrome without mutations of TP53 and in some other sporadic human tumors earmarking this serine/threonine kinase as a candidate tumor suppressor gene Thus we analyzed the CHK2 gene to address whether it is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for pediatric solid tumors We screened for mutations of the CHK2 gene in 25 NB 8 rhbdomyosarcoma 12 and 26 other pediatric solid tumor cell lines as well as 77 fresh tumors including two cases of multiple cancers Using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism PCR-SSCP analysis and reverse transcriptase RT -PCR-SSCP followed by direct sequence analysis we detected only one missense mutation S505T in one NB cell line and two silent mutations in one NB cell line and one NB fresh tumor respectively Through RT-PCR and subcloning analysis we detected a similar expression of the CHK2 gene in all of the NB cell lines and fresh tumors however we identified at least three isoforms of the CHK2 gene two of which have not been reported previously These results suggest that aberrations of the CHK2 gene are rare in pediatric solid tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[4, 815, 537, 57, 225, 22, 3446, 192, 71, 85, 210, 17, 3, 675, 1, 1206, 145, 593, 16, 280, 76, 17, 4, 780, 57, 802, 17, 127, 30, 1245, 214, 68, 1343, 80, 305, 1790, 4, 3, 193, 1, 815, 537, 57, 3, 14253, 145, 1310, 2821, 16, 8, 986, 216, 17, 1698, 8, 854, 200, 4, 261, 1350, 51, 2, 4459, 3988, 1, 1206, 71, 85, 204, 6, 40, 1185, 4, 8, 697, 1, 5066, 9130, 681, 187, 138, 1, 1206, 2, 4, 476, 127, 1928, 171, 57, 54852, 26, 3734, 5131, 216, 22, 8, 1609, 30, 1245, 145, 631, 21, 311, 3, 14253, 145, 6, 1539, 317, 192, 16, 8, 1609, 30, 1245, 145, 9, 815, 537, 57, 21, 2261, 9, 138, 1, 3, 14253, 145, 4, 243, 3446, 66, 54853, 133, 2, 432, 127, 815, 537, 30, 31, 285, 22, 149, 22, 849, 4329, 57, 141, 100, 140, 1, 232, 163, 75, 1451, 1260, 1329, 226, 4787, 7788, 1907, 604, 24411, 65, 2, 1772, 4456, 240, 604, 24411, 370, 20, 1196, 1532, 65, 21, 530, 158, 104, 4007, 258, 54854, 4, 104, 3446, 31, 328, 2, 100, 9890, 138, 4, 104, 3446, 31, 328, 2, 104, 3446, 4329, 30, 106, 298, 240, 604, 2, 54855, 65, 21, 530, 8, 288, 55, 1, 3, 14253, 145, 4, 62, 1, 3, 3446, 31, 285, 2, 4329, 57, 137, 21, 108, 28, 506, 169, 3913, 1, 3, 14253, 145, 100, 1, 92, 47, 44, 85, 210, 373, 46, 99, 309, 17, 2152, 1, 3, 14253, 145, 32, 622, 4, 815, 537, 57]",1540.0,"['pediatric', 'solid', 'neuroblastoma', 'nb', 'ha', 'reported', 'frequency', 'tp', 'alteration', 'lower', 'adult', 'suggesting', 'suppressor', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'development', 'pediatric', 'solid', 'chk', 'product', 'checkpoint', 'kinase', 'play', 'central', 'role', 'dna', 'damage', 'response', 'act', 'upstream', 'tp', 'ha', 'subset', 'li', 'fraumeni', 'syndrome', 'tp', 'sporadic', 'human', 'earmarking', 'serine', 'threonine', 'kinase', 'candidate', 'suppressor', 'chk', 'address', 'candidate', 'suppressor', 'pediatric', 'solid', 'screened', 'chk', 'nb', 'rhbdomyosarcoma', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'pediatric', 'solid', 'line', 'fresh', 'including', 'case', 'multiple', 'polymerase', 'chain', 'reaction', 'single', 'strand', 'conformation', 'polymorphism', 'pcr', 'sscp', 'reverse', 'transcriptase', 'rt', 'pcr', 'sscp', 'followed', 'direct', 'sequence', 'detected', 'missense', 'nb', 'line', 'silent', 'nb', 'line', 'nb', 'fresh', 'respectively', 'rt', 'pcr', 'subcloning', 'detected', 'similar', 'expression', 'chk', 'nb', 'line', 'fresh', 'identified', 'isoforms', 'chk', 'reported', 'previously', 'suggest', 'aberration', 'chk', 'rare', 'pediatric', 'solid']",15942682,8,0.03686635944700461

Definitive surgery and multiagent systemic therapy for patients with localized Ewing sarcoma family of tumors: local outcome and prognostic factors.,Cancer,Cancer,2005-07-01,"The local management of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) often centers on the surgical resectability of the primary lesion and physician biases regarding differences in the morbidity between primary surgical and radiotherapeutic management. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 33 patients with localized ESFT who underwent surgery and received systemic chemotherapy at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). Two multiagent systemic chemotherapy regimens were used: 14 patients received vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and actinomycin D (VACA), and 19 received VACA in combination with ifosphamide and etoposide. The primary tumor was surgically resected via a wide, local excision (n = 32) or a marginal excision (n = 1)performed either at diagnosis or after 3-5 months of systemic chemotherapy. Clinical outcome and prognostic factors for disease control were reported in the current study. The median follow-up for patients was 9.9 years. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 84.5% and 75.8%, respectively. At 5 years, the cumulative incidence of local disease recurrence was 12.5%, and the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 71.7%. The same values were found at 10 years. The site of tumor origin was a significant predictor of EFS. The survival rate of patients whose tumors arose in bone was 78.6%, and the survival rate of patients whose tumors originated in soft tissue was 25.0% (P = 0.028). No other factors investigated were predictive of outcome. Local disease control and overall outcome for patients with ESFT managed by multiagent systemic therapy and surgery was excellent. Local disease control rates remained near 90% at 10-year follow-up.

Lateral malleolus en bloc resection and ankle reconstruction for malignant tumors.,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res.,2005-08-01,"Four children and six adults required en bloc resection of the lateral malleolus for malignant tumors. There were four osteosarcomas, three chondrosarcomas, two Ewing's sarcomas, and one adamantinoma. Surgical margins were wide in seven patients, marginal in two, and intralesional in one. A primary ankle arthrodesis was done in four adults and bracing without any reconstruction was done in four children and two adults. During a mean followup of 14.5 years (range, 3-30 years), there were two local recurrences (two of 10 patients) after a marginal excision and an intralesional excision. One patient had reoperation for a skip osteosarcoma lesion in the proximal fibula. Other complications included chronic osteomyelitis, a lateral talus subluxation and cavovarus deformity, and recurrent ankle instability and degenerative changes of the ankle. At the latest followup, all 10 patients showed no evidence of disease. Five patients who had primary or late ankle arthrodesis had a Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and International Society of Limb Salvage functional score of 28 points (92%), and two adolescents who had postoperative bracing alone had a functional score of 24 points (80%).

Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of gefitinib in children with refractory solid tumors: a Children's Oncology Group Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2005-09-01,"Epidermal growth factor receptor is expressed in pediatric malignant solid tumors. We conducted a phase I trial of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in children with refractory solid tumors. Gefitinib (150, 300, 400, or 500 mg/m2) was administered orally to cohorts of three to six patients once daily continuously until disease progression or significant toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed during course one (day 1 through 28). Of the 25 enrolled patients, 19 (median age, 15 years) were fully evaluable for toxicity and received 54 courses. Dose-limiting toxicity was rash in two patients treated with 500 mg/m2 and elevated ALT and AST in one patient treated with 400 mg/m2. The maximum-tolerated dose was 400 mg/m2/d. The most frequent non-dose-limiting toxicities were grade 1 or 2 dry skin, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. One patient with Ewing's sarcoma had a partial response. Disease stabilized for 8 to > or = 60 weeks in two patients with Wilms' tumor and two with brainstem glioma (one exophytic). At 400 mg/m2, the median peak gefitinib plasma concentration was 2.2 microg/mL (range, 1.2 to 3.6 microg/mL) and occurred at a median of 2.3 hours (range, 2.0 to 8.3 hours) after drug administration.

Radiation therapy for Ewing's sarcoma: results from Memorial Sloan-Kettering in the modern era.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2005-09-28,"To evaluate the outcomes of patients with Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) treated with modern radiotherapy techniques with MRI along with optimal chemotherapy. The records of all 60 patients with ESFT who received radiation to the primary site between 1990 and 2004 were reviewed. All patients received chemotherapy, including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Radiation was used as the sole modality for local control in 31 patients and was given either before (n=3) or after surgical resection (n=26) in the remainder. All patients had MRI and CT scan-based treatment planning, and 43% received intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Radiation doses ranged from 30 Gy to 60 Gy (median, 51 Gy), and 35% received hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Median age was 16 years (range, 2-40 years). Because of selection bias for radiotherapy, the majority of primary tumors were centrally located (72%): spine (n=18), pelvis (n=15), extremities (n=12), chest wall (n=5), head and neck (n=5), and other (n=5). Thirty-eight percent of patients presented with metastatic disease, and 52% of primary tumors were >or=8 cm. Actuarial 3-year local control was 77%. The presence of metastases at diagnosis was an adverse prognostic factor for local control (84% vs. 61%, p=0.036). No other predictive factors for local failure were identified. In patients without metastatic disease, 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 70% and 86%, respectively, whereas in patients with metastases they were both 21%. Follow-up of surviving patients was 6-178 months (median, 41 months). In this unfavorable cohort of ESFT patients, radiation therapy was an effective modality for local control, especially for patients without metastases.

We show here that the systemic delivery of sequence-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the EWS-FLI1 gene product by a targeted, nonviral delivery system dramatically inhibits tumor growth in a murine model of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. The nonviral delivery system uses a cyclodextrin-containing polycation to bind and protect siRNA and transferrin as a targeting ligand for delivery to transferrin receptor-expressing tumor cells. Removal of the targeting ligand or the use of a control siRNA sequence eliminates the antitumor effects. Additionally, no abnormalities in interleukin-12 and IFN-alpha, liver and kidney function tests, complete blood counts, or pathology of major organs are observed from long-term, low-pressure, low-volume tail-vein administrations.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in children with cancer.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-02-01,"To identify predisposing factors, radiologic features, and clinical outcome of posterior reversible leucoencephalopathy (PRES) in children receiving cancer treatment. We identified 11 patients (7 female) who had radiological and clinical features consistent with PRES and were treated for cancer at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between January 1995 and January 2005. Clinical and radiographic data were abstracted from their records. The average age at the time of PRES onset was 10.4 years. Primary diagnoses were acute leukemia (n = 8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1). PRES occurred in 8 patients during the induction phase of treatment, and all 11 patients had hypertension (5 chronically). Seizure activity was proximate to cytarabine and tacrolimus administration in three patients and further seizures occurred with re-administration of these medications in two patients. Coagulation and chemistry studies were normal. Concurrent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated T2 signal abnormalities in all 11 patients, restricted diffusion in 4, and hemorrhage in 3. Follow-up MRI showed chronic changes consistent with a previous hemorrhage in three and evidence of prior parenchymal ischemia in one. Three patients developed epilepsy and remain on chronic anticonvulsant therapy. PRES is an increasingly recognized complication of pediatric cancer treatment.

Intensive therapy with growth factor support for patients with Ewing tumor metastatic at diagnosis: Pediatric Oncology Group/Children's Cancer Group Phase II Study 9457--a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2006-01-01,"Prognosis is poor for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis at diagnosis. We intensified a five-drug therapy (ifosfamide, etoposide alternated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) using filgrastim but not stem-cell support. We studied topotecan alone and combined with cyclophosphamide in therapeutic windows before the five-drug therapy. A randomly assigned proportion of patients received amifostine as a cytoprotective agent. Eligible patients were < or = 30 years old and had histologically proven Ewing sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and metastasis at diagnosis. Chemotherapeutic cycles began every 21 days, after recovery from toxicities. One hundred ten of the 117 patients enrolled were eligible. Thirty-six patients received initial topotecan. Three had partial responses (PRs), and 17 had progressive disease (PD). Thirty-seven patients were administered topotecan and cyclophosphamide; 21 of these patients achieved PR, and one patient had PD. In a randomly assigned group of 69 patients, amifostine did not provide myeloprotection, which was measured by absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, or cycle intervals. The best responses to the overall therapy included 45 complete responses, 41 PRs, stable disease in 14 patients, and PD in five patients. For all patients, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 24% (+/- 4%), and the overall survival rate was 46% (+/- 5%). For the 39 patients with isolated pulmonary metastases, the 2-year EFS rate was 31% (+/- 7%) compared with 20% (+/- 5%) for patients with more widespread disease. Topotecan had limited activity in patients with Ewing sarcoma or PNET metastatic at diagnosis. The topotecan-cyclophosphamide combination was active. Amifostine was not myeloprotective.

"Concomitant administration of vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide for high-risk sarcomas: the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital experience.",Cancer,Cancer,2006-04-01,"Intensified chemotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. Vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide are highly effective against pediatric sarcomas. The authors investigated the feasibility of administering these agents concomitantly within a defined period. In the prospective high-risk sarcoma (HIRISA) Phase II trial HIRISA1, pediatric patients with high-risk sarcomas received 3 cycles of intensive vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (VACIE) before radiotherapy and/or surgery began at Week 9 with concurrent vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (Week 9) and vincristine and ifosfamide (Week 12). Three additional cycles of VACIE were then given. After delayed hematologic recovery in the first 11 patients, the protocol was modified (HIRISA2) to delay local control therapy until after 5 cycles of VACIE (to be completed within 18 weeks). Patients who responded to the protocols were eligible for myeloablative consolidation with autologous stem cell support. Eleven of 24 patients (median age, 14.9 years) had Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, 9 patients had rhabdomyosarcoma, and 4 patients had unresectable desmoplastic small round cell tumors. Seven of 13 patients on HIRISA2, but none of 11 patients on HIRISA1, completed therapy within the specified time. Reversible Grade 4 myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. Major nonhematologic toxic effects were mucositis, nutritional impairment, hypotension, and peripheral neuropathy. Three patients died of toxicity.

Therapy-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia after Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Blood,Blood,2006-09-19,"This study describes the magnitude of risk of therapy-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML) in 578 individuals diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and enrolled on Children's Oncology Group therapeutic protocol, INT-0091. Between 1988 and 1992, patients with or without metastatic disease were randomized to receive doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin (regimen A) or these 4 drugs alternating with etoposide and ifosfamide (regimen B). Between 1992 and 1994, patients with metastatic disease were nonrandomly assigned to receive high-intensity therapy (regimen C: regimen B therapy with higher doses of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide). Median age at diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma was 12 years, and median length of follow-up, 8 years. Eleven patients developed t-MDS/AML, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 2% at 5 years. While patients treated on regimens A and B were at a low risk for development of t-MDS/AML (cumulative incidence: 0.4% and 0.9% at 5 years, respectively), patients treated on regimen C were at a 16-fold increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML (cumulative incidence: 11% at 5 years), when compared with those treated on regimen A. Increasing exposure to ifosfamide from 90 to 140 g/m2, cyclophosphamide from 9.6 to 17.6 g/m2, and doxorubicin from 375 to 450 mg/m2 increased the risk of t-MDS/AML significantly.",Comparative Study,4872.0,84.0,This study describes the magnitude of risk of therapy-related myelodysplasia and acute myeloid t-MDS/AML in 578 individuals diagnosed with and enrolled on Children 's Oncology Group therapeutic protocol INT-0091 Between 1988 and 1992 patients with or without metastatic disease were randomized to receive doxorubicin vincristine cyclophosphamide and dactinomycin regimen A or these 4 drugs alternating with etoposide and ifosfamide regimen B Between 1992 and 1994 patients with metastatic disease were nonrandomly assigned to receive high-intensity therapy regimen C regimen B therapy with higher doses of doxorubicin cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide Median age at diagnosis of was 12 years and median length of follow-up 8 years Eleven patients developed t-MDS/AML resulting in a cumulative incidence of 2 at 5 years While patients treated on regimens A and B were at a low risk for development of t-MDS/AML cumulative incidence 0.4 and 0.9 at 5 years respectively patients treated on regimen C were at a 16-fold increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML cumulative incidence 11 at 5 years when compared with those treated on regimen A Increasing exposure to ifosfamide from 90 to 140 g/m2 cyclophosphamide from 9.6 to 17.6 g/m2 and doxorubicin from 375 to 450 mg/m2 increased the risk of t-MDS/AML significantly,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[26, 45, 2677, 3, 3131, 1, 43, 1, 36, 139, 6128, 2, 286, 533, 102, 1223, 329, 4, 10431, 869, 265, 5, 2, 346, 23, 541, 292, 413, 87, 189, 1182, 7805, 26303, 59, 3314, 2, 2846, 7, 5, 15, 187, 113, 34, 11, 384, 6, 560, 856, 2132, 1112, 2, 10295, 477, 8, 15, 46, 39, 600, 5181, 5, 1934, 2, 3157, 477, 132, 59, 2846, 2, 3023, 7, 5, 113, 34, 11, 24675, 896, 6, 560, 64, 837, 36, 477, 256, 477, 132, 36, 5, 142, 415, 1, 856, 1112, 2, 3157, 52, 89, 28, 147, 1, 10, 133, 60, 2, 52, 1318, 1, 166, 126, 66, 60, 2627, 7, 276, 102, 1223, 329, 1113, 4, 8, 967, 287, 1, 18, 28, 33, 60, 369, 7, 73, 23, 472, 8, 2, 132, 11, 28, 8, 154, 43, 9, 193, 1, 102, 1223, 329, 967, 287, 13, 39, 2, 13, 83, 28, 33, 60, 106, 7, 73, 23, 477, 256, 11, 28, 8, 245, 1116, 101, 43, 1, 931, 102, 1223, 329, 967, 287, 175, 28, 33, 60, 198, 72, 5, 135, 73, 23, 477, 8, 602, 645, 6, 3157, 29, 424, 6, 3304, 499, 821, 1112, 29, 83, 49, 6, 269, 49, 499, 821, 2, 856, 29, 4175, 6, 5669, 81, 821, 101, 3, 43, 1, 102, 1223, 329, 97]",1309.0,"['describes', 'magnitude', 'risk', 'therapy', 'related', 'myelodysplasia', 'acute', 'myeloid', 'leukemia', 'md', 'aml', 'individual', 'diagnosed', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'enrolled', 'child', 'oncology', 'group', 'therapeutic', 'protocol', 'int', 'patient', 'metastatic', 'disease', 'randomized', 'receive', 'doxorubicin', 'vincristine', 'dactinomycin', 'regimen', 'drug', 'alternating', 'etoposide', 'ifosfamide', 'regimen', 'patient', 'metastatic', 'disease', 'nonrandomly', 'assigned', 'receive', 'high', 'intensity', 'therapy', 'regimen', 'regimen', 'therapy', 'higher', 'dos', 'doxorubicin', 'ifosfamide', 'median', 'age', 'diagnosis', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'wa', 'year', 'median', 'length', 'follow', 'year', 'patient', 'developed', 'md', 'aml', 'resulting', 'cumulative', 'incidence', 'year', 'patient', 'treated', 'regimen', 'low', 'risk', 'development', 'md', 'aml', 'cumulative', 'incidence', 'year', 'respectively', 'patient', 'treated', 'regimen', 'fold', 'increased', 'risk', 'developing', 'md', 'aml', 'cumulative', 'incidence', 'year', 'compared', 'treated', 'regimen', 'increasing', 'exposure', 'ifosfamide', 'doxorubicin', 'mg', 'increased', 'risk', 'md', 'aml', 'significantly']",16985182,6,0.027649769585253458
A model for quantitative changes in the magnetic resonance parameters of muscle in children after therapeutic irradiation.,Magnetic resonance imaging,Magn Reson Imaging,2006-10-25,"This study aimed to develop objective models of radiation effects on musculature in children with soft tissue sarcoma using treatment dosimetry and clinical and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that may be used to guide treatment planning or predict side effects. In the initial 13 patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy (RT) on a Phase II study of conformal or intensity-modulated RT for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma approved by an Institutional Review Board, we evaluated quantitative MRI changes in the musculature to assess radiation-related treatment effects. Patients with soft tissue sarcoma, including Ewing's sarcoma, had quantitative T1, T2 and dynamic enhanced MRI (DEMRI) performed before, during (Week 4) and after RT (Week 12). Regions of interest were selected in consistent locations within and outside the high-dose regions (on ipsilateral and contralateral sides when available). Mean RT dose, T1, T2 and DEMRI parameters were calculated and modeled using a mixed random coefficient dose model. The mean doses to the high- and low-dose regions were 56.4 Gy (41.8-75.3 Gy) and 13.0 Gy (0.1-37.5 Gy), respectively. Compared with tissues distant from the tumor bed, maximal enhancement was significantly increased in tissues adjacent to the tumor/tumor bed prior to RT (60.6 vs. 44.2, P=.045) and remained elevated after 12 weeks. T1 was significantly elevated in tissues adjacent to the tumor bed prior to RT (942.4 vs. 759.0, P=.0078). The slope of longitudinal change in T1 was greater for tissues that received low-dose irradiation than those that received high-dose irradiation (P=.0488). The effect of dose on the slope of T2 was different (P=.0333) when younger and older patients are compared. Acute affects of irradiation in muscle are quantifiable via MRI. These models provide evidence that quantifiable MRI parameters may be correlated with patient parameters of radiation dose and clinical factors including patient age. Long-term follow-up will be required to determine if acute changes correlate with clinically significant late effects.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",4836.0,5.0,This study aimed to develop objective

Chemotherapy response is an important predictor of local recurrence in Ewing sarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-02-01,"Local recurrence in Ewing sarcoma is associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of the study was to determine the factors that predict local recurrence after surgical treatment of the primary tumor. Between 1990 and 2001, 64 patients underwent surgical resection of Ewing sarcoma. Surgical margins were assessed histologically and radiologically. Response to preoperative chemotherapy was determined by detailed specimen mapping. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model. A number of factors were found to be associated with local recurrence on univariate analysis. Patients with a good response to chemotherapy (> or = 90% tumor necrosis), had superior LRFS at 5 years (86% vs 51%, P = .015). Central site of disease was associated with an increased rate of recurrence. The LRFS at 5 years was 50% for the chest wall, 74% for pelvic/scapular, and 86% for extremity tumors (P = .083). Positive surgical margin was not a strong predictor of recurrence (P = .72). A critical analysis of minimal surgical margin based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans also failed to reveal an association between margin and local recurrence. In multivariate analysis, the 2 independent predictors of local recurrence were histological response to chemotherapy and central site of disease.

Early lymphocyte recovery as a prognostic indicator for high-risk Ewing sarcoma.,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol.,2007-01-01,"Increasing evidence suggests that lymphocyte recovery plays a major part in tumor control. Facilitating immune reconstitution might be a novel direction of cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine if early lymphocyte recovery is an independent prognostic indicator for high-risk Ewing sarcoma outcome. Data of 24 Ewing sarcoma patients were analyzed (age, 3 to 50 y; median, 16.5; male to female, 16:8). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of the total population was 47.9% [10.6 standard error (SE)]. Patients were separated into 2 groups: prolonged lymphopenia versus early lymphocyte recovery, using a threshold absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of > or =500 cells/microL on day 15. The majority (67%; n=16) of the patients had an ALC > or =500 cells/microL, and of these 10/16 are alive with a 5-year OS of 58.7% (13.2 SE). In contrast, 33% (n=8) of patients had an ALC <500 cells/microL on day 15 and only 2/8 are alive with a 5-year OS of 25% (15.3 SE). This difference was significant (P=0.007 using the log rank test). When comparing patients with metastatic disease, patients with an ALC-15 < 500 cells/microL had a median survival of 13 months, whereas patients with an ALC-15 > or =500 cells/microL had a median survival of 29.5 months. All patients had an ALC before chemotherapy of >1000 cells/microL. The difference was significant (P value=0.001 using the log rank test). Univariate analysis of platelet counts, age, sex, and absolute neutrophil count showed no statistically significant association with OS. The data demonstrate that an ALC > or =500 cells/microL on day 15 of the first course of chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor associated with superior OS in high-risk Ewing sarcoma.",Clinical Trial,4768.0,46.0,Increasing evidence suggests that lymphocyte recovery plays a major part in tumor control Facilitating immune reconstitution might be a novel direction of cancer therapy The purpose of this study was to determine if early lymphocyte recovery is an independent prognostic indicator for high-risk outcome Data of 24 patients were analyzed age 3 to 50 y median 16.5 male to female 16:8 The 5-year overall survival OS of the total population was 47.9 10.6 standard error SE Patients were separated into 2 groups prolonged lymphopenia versus early lymphocyte recovery using a threshold absolute lymphocyte count ALC of or =500 cells/microL on day 15 The majority 67 n=16 of the patients had an ALC or =500 cells/microL and of these 10/16 are alive with a 5-year OS of 58.7 13.2 SE In contrast 33 n=8 of patients had an ALC 500 cells/microL on day 15 and only 2/8 are alive with a 5-year OS of 25 15.3 SE This difference was significant P=0.007 using the log rank test When comparing patients with metastatic disease patients with an ALC-15 500 cells/microL had a median survival of 13 months whereas patients with an ALC-15 or =500 cells/microL had a median survival of 29.5 months All patients had an ALC before chemotherapy of 1000 cells/microL The difference was significant P value=0.001 using the log rank test Univariate analysis of platelet counts age sex and absolute neutrophil count showed no statistically significant association with OS The data demonstrate that an ALC or =500 cells/microL on day 15 of the first course of chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor associated with superior OS in high-risk,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[602, 241, 844, 17, 1448, 1602, 1698, 8, 458, 760, 4, 30, 182, 5379, 250, 5616, 822, 40, 8, 229, 4651, 1, 12, 36, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 492, 191, 1448, 1602, 16, 35, 306, 177, 3287, 9, 64, 43, 228, 74, 1, 259, 7, 11, 311, 89, 27, 6, 212, 2055, 52, 245, 33, 1045, 6, 1061, 245, 66, 3, 33, 111, 63, 25, 118, 1, 3, 181, 266, 10, 662, 83, 79, 49, 260, 3444, 3428, 7, 11, 4910, 237, 18, 271, 1069, 3655, 185, 191, 1448, 1602, 75, 8, 2390, 1766, 1448, 1276, 3749, 1, 15, 1666, 37, 5128, 23, 218, 167, 3, 686, 598, 78, 245, 1, 3, 7, 42, 35, 3749, 15, 1666, 37, 5128, 2, 1, 46, 79, 245, 32, 1701, 5, 8, 33, 111, 118, 1, 717, 67, 233, 18, 3428, 4, 748, 466, 78, 66, 1, 7, 42, 35, 3749, 1666, 37, 5128, 23, 218, 167, 2, 158, 18, 66, 32, 1701, 5, 8, 33, 111, 118, 1, 243, 167, 27, 3428, 26, 523, 10, 93, 19, 13, 1999, 75, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 198, 1430, 7, 5, 113, 34, 7, 5, 35, 3749, 167, 1666, 37, 5128, 42, 8, 52, 25, 1, 233, 53, 547, 7, 5, 35, 3749, 167, 15, 1666, 37, 5128, 42, 8, 52, 25, 1, 462, 33, 53, 62, 7, 42, 35, 3749, 348, 56, 1, 2345, 37, 5128, 3, 523, 10, 93, 19, 549, 13, 144, 75, 3, 1066, 1026, 412, 880, 65, 1, 1596, 1911, 89, 1035, 2, 1766, 2595, 1276, 224, 77, 712, 93, 248, 5, 118, 3, 74, 608, 17, 35, 3749, 15, 1666, 37, 5128, 23, 218, 167, 1, 3, 157, 906, 1, 56, 16, 35, 306, 177, 161, 41, 5, 1123, 118, 4, 64, 43]",1620.0,"['increasing', 'evidence', 'suggests', 'lymphocyte', 'recovery', 'play', 'major', 'control', 'facilitating', 'immune', 'reconstitution', 'novel', 'direction', 'therapy', 'purpose', 'wa', 'determine', 'early', 'lymphocyte', 'recovery', 'independent', 'prognostic', 'indicator', 'high', 'risk', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'outcome', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'patient', 'age', 'median', 'male', 'female', 'year', 'overall', 'survival', 'total', 'population', 'wa', 'standard', 'error', 'se', 'patient', 'separated', 'group', 'prolonged', 'lymphopenia', 'versus', 'early', 'lymphocyte', 'recovery', 'threshold', 'absolute', 'lymphocyte', 'count', 'alc', 'microl', 'day', 'majority', 'patient', 'alc', 'microl', 'alive', 'year', 'se', 'contrast', 'patient', 'alc', 'microl', 'day', 'alive', 'year', 'se', 'difference', 'wa', 'significant', 'log', 'rank', 'test', 'comparing', 'patient', 'metastatic', 'disease', 'patient', 'alc', 'microl', 'median', 'survival', 'month', 'patient', 'alc', 'microl', 'median', 'survival', 'month', 'patient', 'alc', 'chemotherapy', 'microl', 'difference', 'wa', 'significant', 'value', 'log', 'rank', 'test', 'univariate', 'platelet', 'count', 'age', 'sex', 'absolute', 'neutrophil', 'count', 'showed', 'statistically', 'significant', 'association', 'demonstrate', 'alc', 'microl', 'day', 'course', 'chemotherapy', 'independent', 'prognostic', 'factor', 'associated', 'superior', 'high', 'risk', 'ewing', 'sarcoma']",17230066,13,0.059907834101382486

Evidence-based recommendations for local therapy for soft tissue sarcomas.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2007-03-01,"There has been a gradual migration in the local treatment of soft tissue sarcomas from amputation and similar radical resectional approaches to more conservative, function-preserving surgery combined with radiotherapy. This progress has been made possible by small, single-institution, randomized trials that demonstrated the superiority of this more conservative, combined-modality approach. In the new millennium, attention has shifted to defining subsets of patients who might be adequately treated by surgery alone and defining the optimal sequence of surgery and radiation for patients who require both types of local therapy. There remains considerable discussion and debate surrounding the issue of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy for patients with localized soft tissue sarcomas. Adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard of care for adults who have the subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas that typically occur in pediatric patients (Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma), and just as clearly, adjuvant chemotherapy is not warranted in patients with low- and intermediate-risk disease (stages I and II).

We conducted a phase I trial of 17-AAG in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor to determine the maximum tolerated dose, define toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles, and generate data about molecular target modulation. Escalating doses of 17-AAG were administered i.v. over 1 to 2 h twice weekly for 2 weeks every 21 days until patients experienced disease progression or toxicity. harmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were done during cycle 1. Fifteen patients were enrolled onto dose levels between 150 and 360 mg/m(2); 13 patients were evaluable for toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was 270 mg/m(2). DLTs were grade 3 transaminitis and hypoxia. Two patients with osteosarcoma and bulky pulmonary metastases died during cycle 1 and were not evaluable for toxicity. No objective responses were observed. 17-AAG pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients were linear; clearance and half-life were 21.6 +/- 6.21 (mean +/- SD) L/h/m(2) and 2.6 +/- 0.95 h, respectively. Posttherapy increases in levels of the inducible isoform of Hsp70, a marker of target modulation, were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at all dose levels. 17-AAG was well tolerated at a dose of 270 mg/m(2) administered twice weekly for 2 of 3 weeks.

Dasatinib inhibits migration and invasion in diverse human sarcoma cell lines and induces apoptosis in bone sarcoma cells dependent on SRC kinase for survival.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-03-01,"Sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors for which there are limited treatment options. One potential molecular target for sarcoma treatment is the Src tyrosine kinase. Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a small-molecule inhibitor of Src kinase activity, is a promising cancer therapeutic agent with p.o. bioavailability. Dasatinib exhibits antitumor effects in cultured human cell lines derived from epithelial tumors, including prostate and lung carcinomas. However, the action of dasatinib in mesenchymally derived tumors has yet to be shown. Based on our previous findings of Src activation in human sarcomas, we evaluated the effects of dasatinib in 12 cultured human sarcoma cell lines derived from bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Dasatinib inhibited Src kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations in these sarcoma cell lines. Downstream components of Src signaling, including focal adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate (p130(CAS)), were also inhibited at similar concentrations. This inhibition of Src signaling was accompanied by blockade of cell migration and invasion. Moreover, apoptosis was induced in the osteosarcoma and Ewing's subset of bone sarcomas at nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib. Inhibition of Src protein expression by small interfering RNA also induced apoptosis, indicating that these bone sarcoma cell lines are dependent on Src activity for survival. These results show that dasatinib inhibits migration and invasion of diverse sarcoma cell types and selectively blocks the survival of bone sarcoma cells. Therefore, dasatinib may provide therapeutic benefit by preventing the growth and metastasis of sarcomas in patients.",Journal Article,4709.0,191.0,Sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors for which there are limited treatment options One potential molecular target for treatment is the Src tyrosine kinase Dasatinib BMS-354825 a small-molecule inhibitor of Src kinase activity is a promising cancer therapeutic agent with p.o bioavailability Dasatinib exhibits antitumor effects in cultured human cell lines derived from epithelial tumors including and carcinomas However the action of dasatinib in mesenchymally derived tumors has yet to be shown Based on our previous findings of Src activation in human sarcomas we evaluated the effects of dasatinib in 12 cultured human cell lines derived from and soft tissue sarcomas Dasatinib inhibited Src kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations in these cell lines Downstream components of Src signaling including focal adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate p130 CAS were also inhibited at similar concentrations This inhibition of Src signaling was accompanied by blockade of cell migration and invasion Moreover apoptosis was induced in the and 's subset of sarcomas at nanomolar concentrations of dasatinib Inhibition of Src protein expression by small interfering RNA also induced apoptosis indicating that these cell lines are dependent on Src activity for survival These results show that dasatinib inhibits migration and invasion of diverse cell types and selectively blocks the survival of cells Therefore dasatinib may provide therapeutic benefit by preventing the growth and metastasis of sarcomas in patients,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1479, 32, 622, 393, 1569, 57, 9, 92, 125, 32, 383, 24, 838, 104, 174, 219, 283, 9, 24, 16, 3, 2023, 564, 216, 1674, 3502, 23350, 8, 302, 1354, 230, 1, 2023, 216, 128, 16, 8, 721, 12, 189, 420, 5, 19, 1990, 5499, 1674, 4273, 579, 176, 4, 3197, 171, 31, 285, 526, 29, 701, 57, 141, 2, 826, 137, 3, 1578, 1, 1674, 4, 44657, 526, 57, 71, 1145, 6, 40, 443, 90, 23, 114, 698, 272, 1, 2023, 363, 4, 171, 1479, 21, 194, 3, 176, 1, 1674, 4, 133, 3197, 171, 31, 285, 526, 29, 2, 1214, 246, 1479, 1674, 879, 2023, 216, 128, 28, 7927, 1003, 4, 46, 31, 285, 1489, 1628, 1, 2023, 314, 141, 2137, 2128, 216, 2, 44658, 41, 4235, 15206, 10205, 11, 120, 879, 28, 288, 1003, 26, 297, 1, 2023, 314, 10, 2756, 20, 1189, 1, 31, 1381, 2, 578, 1393, 351, 10, 277, 4, 3, 2, 292, 697, 1, 1479, 28, 7927, 1003, 1, 1674, 297, 1, 2023, 178, 55, 20, 302, 3449, 893, 120, 277, 351, 1716, 17, 46, 31, 285, 32, 470, 23, 2023, 128, 9, 25, 46, 99, 514, 17, 1674, 1576, 1381, 2, 578, 1, 1867, 31, 630, 2, 2382, 2860, 3, 25, 1, 37, 673, 1674, 68, 377, 189, 247, 20, 3017, 3, 129, 2, 278, 1, 1479, 4, 7]",1531.0,"['sarcoma', 'rare', 'malignant', 'mesenchymal', 'limited', 'treatment', 'option', 'potential', 'molecular', 'target', 'sarcoma', 'treatment', 'src', 'tyrosine', 'kinase', 'dasatinib', 'bm', 'small', 'molecule', 'inhibitor', 'src', 'kinase', 'activity', 'promising', 'therapeutic', 'agent', 'bioavailability', 'dasatinib', 'exhibit', 'antitumor', 'effect', 'cultured', 'human', 'line', 'derived', 'epithelial', 'including', 'prostate', 'lung', 'carcinoma', 'action', 'dasatinib', 'mesenchymally', 'derived', 'ha', 'shown', 'based', 'previous', 'finding', 'src', 'activation', 'human', 'sarcoma', 'evaluated', 'effect', 'dasatinib', 'cultured', 'human', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'derived', 'bone', 'soft', 'tissue', 'sarcoma', 'dasatinib', 'inhibited', 'src', 'kinase', 'activity', 'nanomolar', 'concentration', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'downstream', 'component', 'src', 'signaling', 'including', 'focal', 'adhesion', 'kinase', 'crk', 'associated', 'substrate', 'ca', 'inhibited', 'similar', 'concentration', 'inhibition', 'src', 'signaling', 'wa', 'accompanied', 'blockade', 'migration', 'invasion', 'apoptosis', 'wa', 'induced', 'osteosarcoma', 'ewing', 'subset', 'bone', 'sarcoma', 'nanomolar', 'concentration', 'dasatinib', 'inhibition', 'src', 'expression', 'small', 'interfering', 'rna', 'induced', 'apoptosis', 'indicating', 'bone', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'dependent', 'src', 'activity', 'survival', 'dasatinib', 'inhibits', 'migration', 'invasion', 'diverse', 'sarcoma', 'type', 'selectively', 'block', 'survival', 'bone', 'sarcoma', 'dasatinib', 'provide', 'therapeutic', 'benefit', 'preventing', 'growth', 'metastasis', 'sarcoma', 'patient']",17363602,11,0.05069124423963134
E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion in ewing tumor cells mediates suppression of anoikis through activation of the ErbB4 tyrosine kinase.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2007-04-01,"Ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions is one of the major hallmarks of transformed cells. Key to this is the capacity of cells to suppress anoikis, or programmed cell death induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix. To model this phenomenon in vitro, we plated Ewing tumor cells under anchorage-independent conditions by transferring them to dishes coated with agar to prevent attachment to underlying plastic. This resulted in marked up-regulation of E-cadherin and rapid formation of multicellular spheroids in suspension. Addition of calcium chelators, antibodies to E-cadherin (but not to other cadherins or beta(1)-integrin), or expression of dominant negative E-cadherin led to massive apoptosis of spheroid cultures whereas adherent cultures were unaffected. This correlated with reduced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway but not the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 cascade. Furthermore, spheroid cultures showed profound chemoresistance to multiple cytotoxic agents compared with adherent cultures, which could be reversed by alpha-E-cadherin antibodies or dominant negative E-cadherin. In a screen for potential downstream effectors of spheroid cell survival, we detected E-cadherin-dependent activation of the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase but not of other ErbB family members. Reduction of ErbB4 levels by RNA interference blocked Akt activation and spheroid cell survival and restored chemosensitivity to Ewing sarcoma spheroids. Our results indicate that anchorage-independent Ewing sarcoma cells suppress anoikis through a pathway involving E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion, which leads to ErbB4 activation of the

Opportunities for improving the therapeutic ratio for patients with sarcoma.,The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2007-06-01,"Sarcomas are mesenchymal cancers, which, in many cases, have distinctive molecular features. Limb-sparing surgery delivered at specialised sarcoma centres as part of a multidisciplinary approach has become the standard treatment for most patients and usually provides excellent local control. Preoperative treatment with chemotherapy is most common for patients with bone sarcomas. The ideal sequence of surgery and radiation for local management of soft-tissue sarcoma remains controversial on the basis of early versus late treatment complications, although preoperative radiation can provide the best results for improved long-term function. New methods for radiation delivery and tumour sensitisation might provide further improvements. However, metastatic disease is common, and conventional chemotherapy provides for only a narrow therapeutic window outside of a few responsive pathological subtypes. Targeting underlying molecular events in specific sarcomas can provide for dramatic benefits, as has been seen with imatinib treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumours and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Trials of agents targeting the cell cycle and angiogenesis in soft-tissue sarcomas, and of those targeting osteoclasts in bone sarcomas, are currently underway. Biological data and preclinical studies support trials using inhibitors of hedgehog signalling in chondrosarcoma, inhibitors of wnt/beta-catenin in osteosarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis, and inhibitors of histone deacetylases in synovial sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Pharmacogenetic approaches will be needed to identify individual determinants of response and outcome in order to maximise the benefits of targeting specific molecular events and keep side-effects to a minimum.

Loss of antibody titers and effectiveness of revaccination in post-chemotherapy pediatric sarcoma patients.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2007-10-01,"Little is known about the effects of chemotherapy on patient antibody titers to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases; thus, there is no standard protocol for revaccinating post-chemotherapy patients. To assess losses of detectable antibody titers due to chemotherapy, we retrospectively examined antibody titers for tetanus, varicella, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and polio in 109 pediatric sarcoma patients. We also evaluated revaccination data to determine current practices and efficacy of revaccination. We limited our sample to osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma patients to control for the chemotherapy regimen patients received. Patients had pre-treatment detectable antibody titer that fell within the range of healthy children's antibody titers. However, 71% of patients had post-chemotherapy negative titers for at least one infectious disease. Patients most commonly had negative titers for hepatitis B (64%). Few patients had negative titers for measles (14%), mumps (9%), rubella (4%), polio 1 (0%), polio 2 (2.9%), polio 3 (4.8%), tetanus (5%), or varicella (11%). Revaccinations most frequently administered were hepatitis B and polio. Our findings suggest that post-chemotherapy patients may need to be revaccinated against certain vaccine-preventable diseases including hepatitis B, tetanus, varicella, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella.

Analysis of prognostic factors in ewing sarcoma family of tumors: review of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital studies.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-07-01,"Advances in systemic and local therapies have improved outcomes for patients with the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT). As new treatments are developed, a critical review of data from past treatment eras is needed to identify clinically relevant risk groups. The authors reviewed the records of 220 patients with ESFT who were treated on protocols at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1979 to 2004. Two treatment eras were defined. Factors predictive of outcome were analyzed to identify distinct risk groups. The median age at diagnosis was 13.7 years (range, 1.1-25.2 years). Metastatic disease was associated with tumors measuring >8 cm (P = .002) and axial location (P = .014). The 5-year overall survival (OS) estimate (63.5% +/- 3.5%) did not appear to differ by protocol. Tumor stage and size were found to be the only independent predictors of outcome. Treatment era and type of local control therapy were found to influence the outcome of patients with localized disease. Four risk groups were defined: favorable risk (age <14 years with localized, nonpelvic tumors), intermediate risk (localized, age >/=14 years, or pelvic tumors), unfavorable-pulmonary (isolated lung metastases), and unfavorable-extrapulmonary (extrapulmonary metastases). The 5-year OS estimates for these groups were 88.1% +/- 4.4%, 64.9% +/- 5.2%, 53.8% +/- 9.4%, and 27.2% +/- 7.3%, respectively (P < .001).

Bone mineral density deficits in pediatric patients treated for sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2008-05-01,"Children treated for sarcoma are at risk of treatment-associated deficits in bone mineral density (BMD). We investigated the severity of risk factors for BMD deficits in this patient population. Using signed-rank test and logistic regression analysis, we retrospectively analyzed the relation of treatment variables and other potential risk factors to BMD (using quantitative computed tomography (QCT)) of 99 patients treated for pediatric sarcoma who had completed therapy at least 1 year previously. The study group (38% rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), 25% osteosarcoma (OS), 24% Ewing-family tumors, and 12% non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma (NRSTS)) represented 22% of the sarcoma survivors treated between 1982 and 2003 who remained in follow-up at St. Jude. These patients underwent QCT between July 1, 1997 and February 5, 2003. Their median age was 8.7 years (range, 0.2-21.3 years) at diagnosis and 17.4 years (range, 3.3-30.2 years) at the time of BMD measurement; 58% were male and 82% Caucasian.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma as a secondary malignancy in pediatric sarcoma.,Journal of pediatric surgery,J. Pediatr. Surg.,2007-07-01,"Children diagnosed with osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma (ES) have greatly benefited from the addition of alkylator therapy. However, with greater numbers of long-term survivors, the rising incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) is concerning. Herein we report on 2 patients with sarcoma who developed a case of secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma after chemotherapy treatment without associated radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first series of mucoepidermoid carcinomas arising in pediatric patients treated for sarcoma without radiotherapy. Long-term survivors of OS and ES currently undergoing routine follow-up care were reviewed and noted for the development of a new secondary malignancy. Details of their initial evaluation, previous therapies, resection techniques, pathologic findings, and follow-up compose this report. Two patients, a 17-year-old adolescent boy with OS and 16-year-old adolescent girl with ES, with secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland were identified. Both patients underwent primary resection and chemotherapy including alkylating agents, but neither received radiation. The mucoepidermoid carcinomas developed 27 months and 132 months after completion of therapy, respectively, and were noted on routine yearly follow-up. Fine-needle aspiration was nondiagnostic on each, and parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. Pathology revealed low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma with tumor extending to the deep margins for both lesions, and radiotherapy to the parotid bed was administered. There were no surgical complications. One patient is alive, without evidence of recurrent mucoepidermoid carcinoma after 4 years; the other recently completed radiotherapy and is disease-free after 12 months. Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland accounts for less than 10% of all head and neck tumors in childhood. Previous series of secondary mucoepidermoid carcinoma have demonstrated an increased risk in patients with leukemia/lymphoma. This is the first reported series of parotid mucoepidermoid carcinomas occurring after sarcoma treatment without radiotherapy. A common link between the 2 patients may be the use of alkylating therapy.",Case Reports,4587.0,9.0,Children diagnosed with OS and ES have greatly benefited from the addition of alkylator therapy

Undifferentiated small round cell sarcomas with rare EWS gene fusions: identification of a novel EWS-SP3 fusion and of additional cases with the EWS-ETV1 and EWS-FEV fusions.,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,J Mol Diagn,2007-08-09,"Ewing family tumors (EFTs) are prototypical primitive small round blue cell sarcomas arising in bone or extraskeletal soft tissues in children or adolescents. EFTs show fusions of EWS with a gene of the ETS family of transcription factors, either EWS-FLI1 (90 to 95%) or EWS-ERG (5 to 10%). Rare cases with fusions of EWS to other ETS family genes, such as ETV1, E1AF, and FEV, have been identified, but their clinicopathological similarity to classic EFTs remains unclear. We report four new cases of EFT-like tumors with rare EWS fusions, including two with EWS-ETV1, one with EWS-FEV, and a fourth case in which we cloned a novel EWS-SP3 fusion, the first known cancer gene fusion involving a gene of the Sp zinc finger family. Analysis of these three new cases along with data on nine previously reported cases with fusions of EWS to ETV1, E1AF, or FEV suggest a strong predilection for extraskeletal primary sites. EFT-like cases with fusions of EWS to non-ETS translocation partners are also uncommon but involve the same amino-terminal portion of EWS, which in our novel EWS-SP3 fusion is joined to the SP3 zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. As these data further support, these types of EWS fusions are associated with primitive extraskeletal small round cell sarcomas of uncertain lineage arising mainly in the pediatric population.",Journal Article,4548.0,110.0,family tumors EFTs are prototypical primitive small round blue cell sarcomas arising in or extraskeletal soft tissues in children or adolescents EFTs show fusions of EWS with a gene of the ETS family of transcription factors either EWS-FLI1 90 to 95 or EWS-ERG 5 to 10 Rare cases with fusions of EWS to other ETS family genes such as ETV1 E1AF and FEV have been identified but their clinicopathological similarity to classic EFTs remains unclear We report four new cases of EFT-like tumors with rare EWS fusions including two with EWS-ETV1 one with EWS-FEV and a fourth case in which we cloned a novel EWS-SP3 fusion the first known cancer gene fusion involving a gene of the Sp zinc finger family Analysis of these three new cases along with data on nine previously reported cases with fusions of EWS to ETV1 E1AF or FEV suggest a strong predilection for extraskeletal primary sites EFT-like cases with fusions of EWS to non-ETS translocation partners are also uncommon but involve the same amino-terminal portion of EWS which in our novel EWS-SP3 fusion is joined to the SP3 zinc-finger DNA-binding domain As these data further support these types of EWS fusions are associated with primitive extraskeletal small round cell sarcomas of uncertain lineage arising mainly in the pediatric population,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[607, 57, 26623, 32, 14216, 5594, 302, 4436, 3352, 31, 1479, 2635, 4, 15, 9603, 1214, 742, 4, 541, 15, 3101, 26623, 514, 2530, 1, 4528, 5, 8, 145, 1, 3, 4802, 607, 1, 866, 130, 361, 4528, 8327, 424, 6, 48, 15, 4528, 3032, 33, 6, 79, 622, 140, 5, 2530, 1, 4528, 6, 127, 4802, 607, 214, 225, 22, 9298, 44813, 2, 13138, 47, 85, 108, 84, 136, 2721, 6700, 6, 3168, 26623, 469, 1200, 21, 414, 294, 217, 140, 1, 18501, 733, 57, 5, 622, 4528, 2530, 141, 100, 5, 4528, 9298, 104, 5, 4528, 13138, 2, 8, 3608, 473, 4, 92, 21, 8560, 8, 229, 4528, 13919, 1212, 3, 157, 440, 12, 145, 1212, 1267, 8, 145, 1, 3, 4074, 5988, 8079, 607, 65, 1, 46, 169, 217, 140, 1510, 5, 74, 23, 762, 373, 210, 140, 5, 2530, 1, 4528, 6, 9298, 44813, 15, 13138, 309, 8, 1082, 8904, 9, 9603, 86, 633, 18501, 733, 140, 5, 2530, 1, 4528, 6, 220, 4802, 2006, 4005, 32, 120, 2052, 84, 3882, 3, 827, 3078, 2158, 3206, 1, 4528, 92, 4, 114, 229, 4528, 13919, 1212, 16, 17687, 6, 3, 13919, 5988, 8079, 261, 791, 1398, 22, 46, 74, 195, 538, 46, 630, 1, 4528, 2530, 32, 41, 5, 5594, 9603, 302, 4436, 31, 1479, 1, 2717, 2542, 2635, 2615, 4, 3, 815, 266]",1298.0,"['ewing', 'family', 'eft', 'prototypical', 'primitive', 'small', 'round', 'blue', 'sarcoma', 'arising', 'bone', 'extraskeletal', 'soft', 'tissue', 'child', 'adolescent', 'eft', 'fusion', 'ew', 'ets', 'family', 'transcription', 'factor', 'ew', 'fli', 'ew', 'erg', 'rare', 'case', 'fusion', 'ew', 'ets', 'family', 'etv', 'af', 'fev', 'identified', 'similarity', 'classic', 'eft', 'remains', 'unclear', 'report', 'new', 'case', 'eft', 'like', 'rare', 'ew', 'fusion', 'including', 'ew', 'etv', 'ew', 'fev', 'fourth', 'case', 'cloned', 'novel', 'ew', 'sp', 'fusion', 'known', 'fusion', 'involving', 'sp', 'zinc', 'finger', 'family', 'new', 'case', 'previously', 'reported', 'case', 'fusion', 'ew', 'etv', 'af', 'fev', 'suggest', 'strong', 'predilection', 'extraskeletal', 'primary', 'site', 'eft', 'like', 'case', 'fusion', 'ew', 'non', 'ets', 'translocation', 'partner', 'uncommon', 'involve', 'amino', 'terminal', 'portion', 'ew', 'novel', 'ew', 'sp', 'fusion', 'joined', 'sp', 'zinc', 'finger', 'dna', 'binding', 'domain', 'support', 'type', 'ew', 'fusion', 'associated', 'primitive', 'extraskeletal', 'small', 'round', 'sarcoma', 'uncertain', 'lineage', 'arising', 'mainly', 'pediatric', 'population']",17690209,51,0.2350230414746544
Expression of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor and its receptor in human Ewing sarcoma cells and patient tumor specimens: potential consequences of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor administration.,Cancer,Cancer,2007-10-01,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a highly vascular malignancy. It has been demonstrated that both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis contribute to the growth of ES tumors. Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a cytokine known to stimulate bone marrow (BM) stem cell production and angiogenesis, is routinely administered to ES patients after chemotherapy. Whether ES cells and patient tumor samples express G-CSF and its receptor (G-CSFR) and whether treatment with this factor enhances tumor growth was examined. Human ES cell lines were analyzed for expression of G-CSF and G-CSFR in vitro and in vivo. Sixty-eight paraffin-embedded and 15 frozen tumor specimens from patients with ES were also evaluated for the presence of G-CSF and G-CSFR. The in vivo effect of G-CSF on angiogenesis and BM cell migration was determined. Using a TC/7-1 human ES mouse model, the effect of G-CSF administration on ES tumors was investigated. G-CSF and G-CSFR protein and RNA expression was identified in all ES cell lines and patient samples analyzed. In addition, G-CSF was found to stimulate angiogenesis and BM cell migration in vivo. Tumor growth was found to be significantly increased in mice treated with G-CSF. The average tumor volume for the group treated with G-CSF was 1218 mm(3) compared with 577 mm(3) for the control group (P = .006). The findings that ES cells and patient tumors expressed both G-CSF and its receptor in vitro and in vivo and that the administration of G-CSF promoted tumor growth in vivo suggest that the potential consequences of G-CSF administration should be investigated further.",Journal Article,4495.0,28.0,ES is a highly vascular malignancy It has been demonstrated that both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis contribute to the growth of ES tumors Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor G-CSF a cytokine known to stimulate marrow BM stem cell production and angiogenesis is routinely administered to ES patients after chemotherapy Whether ES cells and patient tumor samples express G-CSF and its receptor G-CSFR and whether treatment with this factor enhances tumor growth was examined Human ES cell lines were analyzed for expression of G-CSF and G-CSFR in vitro and in vivo Sixty-eight paraffin-embedded and 15 frozen tumor specimens from patients with ES were also evaluated for the presence of G-CSF and G-CSFR The in vivo effect of G-CSF on angiogenesis and BM cell migration was determined Using a TC/7-1 human ES mouse model the effect of G-CSF administration on ES tumors was investigated G-CSF and G-CSFR protein and RNA expression was identified in all ES cell lines and patient samples analyzed In addition G-CSF was found to stimulate angiogenesis and BM cell migration in vivo Tumor growth was found to be significantly increased in mice treated with G-CSF The average tumor volume for the group treated with G-CSF was 1218 mm 3 compared with 577 mm 3 for the control group P .006 The findings that ES cells and patient tumors expressed both G-CSF and its receptor in vitro and in vivo and that the administration of G-CSF promoted tumor growth in vivo suggest that the potential consequences of G-CSF administration should be investigated further,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3011, 16, 8, 561, 756, 710, 192, 71, 85, 264, 17, 110, 1056, 2, 18370, 1248, 6, 3, 129, 1, 3011, 57, 2764, 1975, 2122, 161, 499, 1211, 8, 1675, 440, 6, 4223, 581, 1246, 452, 31, 1529, 2, 1056, 16, 3066, 468, 6, 3011, 7, 50, 56, 317, 3011, 37, 2, 69, 30, 347, 1669, 499, 1211, 2, 211, 153, 499, 28702, 2, 317, 24, 5, 26, 161, 2519, 30, 129, 10, 409, 171, 3011, 31, 285, 11, 311, 9, 55, 1, 499, 1211, 2, 499, 28702, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 1746, 659, 2487, 2505, 2, 167, 3015, 30, 623, 29, 7, 5, 3011, 11, 120, 194, 9, 3, 463, 1, 499, 1211, 2, 499, 28702, 3, 4, 386, 254, 1, 499, 1211, 23, 1056, 2, 1246, 31, 1381, 10, 509, 75, 8, 3072, 67, 14, 171, 3011, 830, 202, 3, 254, 1, 499, 1211, 634, 23, 3011, 57, 10, 565, 499, 1211, 2, 499, 28702, 178, 2, 893, 55, 10, 108, 4, 62, 3011, 31, 285, 2, 69, 347, 311, 4, 352, 499, 1211, 10, 204, 6, 4223, 1056, 2, 1246, 31, 1381, 4, 386, 30, 129, 10, 204, 6, 40, 97, 101, 4, 399, 73, 5, 499, 1211, 3, 1011, 30, 433, 9, 3, 87, 73, 5, 499, 1211, 10, 31156, 321, 27, 72, 5, 14071, 321, 27, 9, 3, 182, 87, 19, 1861, 3, 272, 17, 3011, 37, 2, 69, 57, 570, 110, 499, 1211, 2, 211, 153, 4, 439, 2, 4, 386, 2, 17, 3, 634, 1, 499, 1211, 2992, 30, 129, 4, 386, 309, 17, 3, 174, 3255, 1, 499, 1211, 634, 257, 40, 565, 195]",1551.0,"['ewing', 'sarcoma', 'highly', 'vascular', 'malignancy', 'ha', 'demonstrated', 'angiogenesis', 'vasculogenesis', 'contribute', 'growth', 'granulocyte', 'colony', 'stimulating', 'factor', 'csf', 'cytokine', 'known', 'stimulate', 'bone', 'marrow', 'bm', 'stem', 'production', 'angiogenesis', 'routinely', 'administered', 'patient', 'chemotherapy', 'patient', 'express', 'csf', 'receptor', 'csfr', 'treatment', 'factor', 'enhances', 'growth', 'wa', 'examined', 'human', 'line', 'expression', 'csf', 'csfr', 'vitro', 'vivo', 'paraffin', 'embedded', 'frozen', 'specimen', 'patient', 'evaluated', 'presence', 'csf', 'csfr', 'vivo', 'effect', 'csf', 'angiogenesis', 'bm', 'migration', 'wa', 'determined', 'tc', 'human', 'mouse', 'model', 'effect', 'csf', 'administration', 'wa', 'investigated', 'csf', 'csfr', 'rna', 'expression', 'wa', 'identified', 'line', 'patient', 'addition', 'csf', 'wa', 'stimulate', 'angiogenesis', 'bm', 'migration', 'vivo', 'growth', 'wa', 'significantly', 'increased', 'mouse', 'treated', 'csf', 'average', 'volume', 'group', 'treated', 'csf', 'wa', 'mm', 'compared', 'mm', 'control', 'group', 'finding', 'patient', 'expressed', 'csf', 'receptor', 'vitro', 'vivo', 'administration', 'csf', 'promoted', 'growth', 'vivo', 'suggest', 'potential', 'consequence', 'csf', 'administration', 'investigated']",17694551,5,0.02304147465437788
Pediatric sarcomas occurring in adults.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2008-03-01,"Sarcomas arise in any part of the body, in any age group.

Combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel in the treatment of children and young adults with refractory bone sarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-07-01,"The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has demonstrated promise in sarcomas diagnosed in adults. In the current study, the toxicity and efficacy of this combination were evaluated in pediatric sarcomas. A retrospective case review of 22 patients with recurrent or refractory bone or soft-tissue sarcomas who received gemcitabine (at a dose of 675 mg/m(2) intravenously on Days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (at a dose of 75-100 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 8) was undertaken. The patients (ages 8-23 years) received a total of 109 courses of chemotherapy (median, 4 courses; range, 1-13 courses). Seventeen patients had osteosarcoma, 2 patients had Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), 1 patient had a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 1 patient had a chondrosarcoma, and 1 patient had an undifferentiated sarcoma. Of the 14 patients evaluable for response, the patient with an MFH achieved a complete response (CR), 3 patients with osteosarcoma achieved a partial response (PR), and 2 patients (1 with ESFT and 1 with osteosarcoma) had stable disease (SD). The overall objective response (CR + PR) rate was 29%. Median duration of response (CR + PR + SD) was 4.8 months (range, 1.6-13 months). The toxicity was manageable and consisted primarily of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.

Targeting Lyn inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in Ewing's sarcoma.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2008-07-01,"Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) play an important role in growth and metastasis of many types of human malignancies. However, their significance in Ewing's sarcoma remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of Lyn, one member of the SFK, in Ewing's sarcoma growth and metastasis and to determine whether a SFK inhibitor can induce Ewing's tumor regression. Lyn was expressed and activated in TC71, A4573, and SK-ES human Ewing's sarcoma cells. Lyn expression was seen in 13 of 15 patient tumor samples, 6 of which showed Lyn activation. Specific inhibition of Lyn using small interfering RNA significantly decreased primary tumor growth and lytic activity, and also reduced lung metastases in vivo. Down-regulation of Lyn resulted in decreased invasive capacity of tumor cells in vitro. AP23994, a small-molecule SFK inhibitor, decreased Lyn kinase activity and suppressed TC71 cell growth in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment of mice bearing s.c. TC71 tumors with AP23994 or with polyethylenimine/Lyn-small interfering RNA gene therapy resulted in reduced Lyn kinase activity and significant tumor growth suppression.

Phase II study of intermediate-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-03-01,"Patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma have a poor outcome with conventional therapies. Cytarabine decreases EWS/FLI1 protein levels in Ewing sarcoma cells and has demonstrated preclinical activity against Ewing sarcoma in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this phase II clinical trial was to estimate the response rate of intermediate-dose cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma. Patients with a histologic diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma were eligible if they were <30 years of age, had relapsed or refractory measurable disease, and met standard organ function requirements. Patients received cytarabine 500 mg/m(2)/dose intravenously over 2 hr every 12 hr for 10 doses with cycles repeated every 21 days. Response was assessed according to RECIST criteria. Ten patients (median age 20 years; 7 males) were treated. Only five patients had documented EWS/FLI1 translocated tumors. No objective responses were seen. One patient had stable disease for 5 cycles before developing progressive disease. All patients evaluable for hematologic toxicity developed grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during protocol therapy.

Self-reported global function among adult survivors of childhood lower-extremity bone tumors: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS).,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,J Cancer Surviv,2008-11-22,"Adult survivors of childhood lower-extremity bone tumors may experience physical and psychosocial late effects that impact physical performance, global function and quality of life. The identification of survivors at greatest risk for poor outcomes will inform potential intervention targets. Study participants were selected from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a multi-institutional study of childhood cancer survivors. Adult survivors (n = 629) of either childhood onset osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, with a primary tumor location in the lower-extremity were identified and contacted via mail to complete an additional questionnaire. Participants completed the Reintegration into Normal Living Index (RNL) to evaluate global function (maximum score of 22), daily function (maximum score of 16) and self perception (maximum score of 6). Survivors reported high levels of global function with an adjusted mean overall RNL index score of 20.6 (SE 0.14), mean daily function score of 15.0 (SD 0.10) and mean self perception score of 5.6 (SE 0.05). While female gender and increasing age were associated with lower RNL scores, the magnitude of difference is of questionable clinical significance. Global function was only moderately correlated with physical performance (r = 0.56) and QOL (r = 0.59). Based upon the RNL index, the vast majority of long-term survivors of childhood lower extremity bone tumors adapt well to their environment.

J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2009-01-01,"To assess the feasibility and outcomes of combination short-course preoperative radiation, resection, and reduced-field (tumor bed without operative field coverage) high-dose postoperative radiation for patients with solid tumors mainly involving the spine and pelvis. Between 1982 and 2006, a total of 48 patients were treated using this treatment strategy for solid tumors involving bone. Radiation treatments used both photons and protons. Of those treated, 52% had chordoma, 31% had chondrosarcoma, 8% had osteosarcoma, and 4% had Ewing's sarcoma, with 71% involving the pelvis/sacrum and 21% elsewhere in the spine. Median preoperative dose was 20 Gy, with a median of 50.4 Gy postoperatively. With 31.8-month median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is 65%; 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, 53.8%; and 5-year local control (LC) rate, 72%. There were no significant differences in OS, DFS, and LC according to histologic characteristics. Between primary and recurrent disease, there was no significant difference in OS rates (74.4% vs. 51.4%, respectively; p = 0.128), in contrast to DFS (71.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0014) and LC rates (88.9% vs. 30.9%; p = 0.0011) favoring primary disease. After resection, 10 patients experienced delayed wound healing that did not significantly impact on OS, DFS, or LC. This approach is promising for patients with bone sarcomas in which resection will likely yield close/positive margins. It appears to inhibit tumor seeding with an acceptable rate of wound-healing complications. Dose escalation is accomplished without high-dose preoperative radiation (likely associated with higher rates of acute wound healing delays) or large-field postoperative radiation only (likely associated with late normal tissue toxicity).

median follow-up the 5-year overall survival OS rate is 65 5-year disease-free survival DFS rate 53.8 and 5-year local control LC rate 72 There were no significant differences in OS DFS and LC according to histologic characteristics Between primary and recurrent disease there was no significant difference in OS rates 74.4 vs. 51.4 respectively p 0.128 in contrast to DFS 71.5 vs. 18.3 p 0.0014 and LC rates 88.9 vs. 30.9 p 0.0011 favoring primary disease After resection 10 patients experienced delayed wound healing that did not significantly impact on OS DFS or LC This approach is promising for patients with sarcomas in which resection will likely yield close/positive margins It appears to inhibit tumor seeding with an acceptable rate of wound-healing complications Dose escalation is accomplished without high-dose preoperative radiation likely associated with higher rates of acute wound healing delays or large-field postoperative radiation only likely associated with late normal tissue toxicity The LC and DFS rates are substantially better for patients with primary than recurrent sarcomas,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[6, 423, 3, 1437,

Dose-intensified compared with standard chemotherapy for nonmetastatic Ewing sarcoma family of tumors: a Children's Oncology Group Study.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-04-06,"The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of malignant tumors of soft tissue and bone sharing a chromosomal translocation affecting the EWS locus. The Intergroup INT-0091 demonstrated the superiority of a regimen of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (VDC), and dactinomycin alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) over VDC for patients with nonmetastatic ESFT of bone. The goal of this study was to determine whether a dose-intensified regimen of VDC alternating with IE would further improve the outcome for patients with nonmetastatic ESFT of bone or soft tissue. Patients with previously untreated, nonmetastatic ESFT of bone or soft tissue were eligible. They were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of VDC/IE over 48 weeks or a dose-intensified regimen of VDC/IE over 30 weeks. Four hundred seventy-eight patients met eligibility requirements: 231 patients received the standard regimen; 247 patients received the intensified regimen. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates for all eligible patients were 71.1% (95% CI, 67.7% to 75.0%) and 78.6% (95% CI, 74.6% to 82.1%), respectively. There was no significant difference (P = .57) in EFS between patients treated with the standard (5-year EFS, 72.1%; 95% CI, 65.8% to 77.5%) or intensified regimen (5-year EFS, 70.1%; 63.9% to 75%).

Phase II multicenter trial of imatinib in 10 histologic subtypes of sarcoma using a bayesian hierarchical statistical model.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-05-18,"PURPOSE The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced sarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day (for body-surface area > or = 1.5 m(2)). The primary end point was response (clinical benefit response [CBR]), defined as complete (CR) or partial response (PR) at 2 months, or stable disease, CR, or PR at 4 months. Rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a Bayesian hierarchical probability model (BHM) accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes. Available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the KIT/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signal transduction pathway. Results One hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of sarcoma were treated. One CR and three PRs were achieved. A CBR was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype: two angiosarcomas (n = 16), 0 Ewing (n = 13), one fibrosarcoma (n = 12), six leiomyosarcomas (n = 29), seven liposarcomas (n = 31), three malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 30), five osteosarcomas (n = 27), one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor (n = 7), 0 rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and three synovial sarcomas (n = 22). Variable expression and mutations within the KIT/PDGFR pathway were observed. CONCLUSION This is the first phase II study of a new agent in sarcoma to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions. The BHM is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes, when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable. Although rare dramatic responses were seen, imatinib is not an active agent in advanced sarcoma in these subtypes.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",3900.0,126.0,PURPOSE The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day for body-surface area or 1.5 m 2 The primary end point was response clinical benefit response CBR defined as complete CR or partial response PR at 2 months or stable disease CR or PR at 4 months Rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a Bayesian hierarchical probability model BHM accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes Available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the KIT/platelet-derived growth factor receptor PDGFR signal transduction pathway Results One hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of were treated One CR and three PRs were achieved A CBR was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype two angiosarcomas n 16 0 n 13 one fibrosarcoma n 12 six leiomyosarcomas n 29 seven liposarcomas n 31 three malignant fibrous histiocytomas n 30 five osteosarcomas n 27 one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor n 7 0 n 2 and three synovial sarcomas n 22 Variable expression and mutations within the KIT/PDGFR pathway were observed CONCLUSION This is the first phase II study of a new agent in to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions The BHM is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable Although rare dramatic responses were seen imatinib is not an active agent in advanced in these subtypes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[743, 3, 743, 1, 26, 160, 10, 6, 423, 3, 209, 1, 577, 4, 7, 5, 104, 1, 79, 338, 814, 1, 131, 7, 2, 636, 625, 7, 11, 73, 391, 5, 577, 6268, 28, 2036, 81, 936, 8, 218, 9, 642, 1255, 965, 15, 14, 33, 188, 18, 3, 86, 396, 741, 10, 51, 38, 247, 51, 6222, 395, 22, 236, 684, 15, 450, 51, 998, 28, 18, 53, 15, 585, 34, 684, 15, 998, 28, 39, 53, 8679, 9, 191, 7202, 262, 296, 34, 267, 11, 90, 23, 8, 5032, 4466, 1320, 202, 45547, 3116, 9, 816, 1, 3, 253, 1, 3, 79, 814, 390, 246, 347, 11, 311, 9, 1598, 262, 3, 1164, 1596, 526, 129, 161, 153, 4103, 1235, 2761, 308, 99, 104, 1128, 2207, 365, 3120, 7, 5, 104, 1, 79, 814, 1, 11, 73, 104, 684, 2, 169, 4018, 11, 513, 8, 6222, 10, 513, 4, 339, 7, 73, 63, 2, 20, 875, 100, 9397, 78, 245, 13, 78, 233, 104, 8378, 78, 133, 437, 6857, 78, 462, 648, 7880, 78, 456, 169, 393, 5870, 27979, 78, 201, 365, 11089, 78, 428, 104, 393, 672, 2476, 7280, 30, 78, 67, 13, 78, 18, 2, 169, 5043, 1479, 78, 350, 1347, 55, 2, 138, 262, 3, 1164, 4103, 308, 11, 164, 1221, 26, 16, 3, 157, 124, 215, 45, 1, 8, 217, 420, 4, 6, 643, 1952, 7, 5, 296, 1, 3, 186, 884, 814, 6, 5634, 12313, 2130, 3, 45547, 16, 35, 323, 596, 9, 4559, 622, 1342, 2, 136, 814, 198, 192, 16, 3203, 6, 16661, 17, 136, 51, 151, 32, 33374, 242, 622, 3079, 253, 11, 527, 577, 16, 44, 35, 544, 420, 4, 131, 4, 46, 814]",1697.0,"['purpose', 'purpose', 'trial', 'wa', 'ass', 'efficacy', 'imatinib', 'patient', 'different', 'subtypes', 'advanced', 'sarcoma', 'patient', 'eligible', 'patient', 'treated', 'daily', 'imatinib', 'dosed', 'mg', 'twice', 'day', 'body', 'surface', 'area', 'primary', 'end', 'point', 'wa', 'response', 'clinical', 'benefit', 'response', 'cbr', 'defined', 'complete', 'cr', 'partial', 'response', 'pr', 'month', 'stable', 'disease', 'cr', 'pr', 'month', 'rule', 'early', 'termination', 'disease', 'type', 'based', 'bayesian', 'hierarchical', 'probability', 'model', 'bhm', 'accounting', 'correlation', 'response', 'subtypes', 'available', 'tissue', 'molecule', 'kit', 'platelet', 'derived', 'growth', 'factor', 'receptor', 'pdgfr', 'signal', 'transduction', 'pathway', 'eighty', 'assessable', 'patient', 'subtypes', 'sarcoma', 'treated', 'cr', 'pr', 'achieved', 'cbr', 'wa', 'achieved', 'patient', 'treated', 'overall', 'subtype', 'angiosarcoma', 'ewing', 'fibrosarcoma', 'leiomyosarcoma', 'seven', 'liposarcoma', 'malignant', 'fibrous', 'histiocytomas', 'osteosarcoma', 'malignant', 'peripheral', 'nerve', 'sheath', 'synovial', 'sarcoma', 'variable', 'expression', 'kit', 'pdgfr', 'pathway', 'observed', 'phase', 'ii', 'new', 'agent', 'sarcoma', 'include', 'sufficient', 'patient', 'common', 'histologic', 'subtypes', 'permit', 'generalizable', 'bhm', 'effective', 'studying', 'rare', 'disease', 'subtypes', 'reasonable', 'assume', 'response', 'rate', 'exchangeable', 'rare', 'dramatic', 'response', 'seen', 'imatinib', 'active', 'agent', 'advanced', 'sarcoma', 'subtypes']",19451433,0,0.0
Ewing's sarcoma: standard and experimental treatment options.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2009-06-17,"Ewing sarcoma family tumors (EWS), which include classic Ewing's sarcoma in addition to primitive neuroectodermal tumor and Askin tumor, are the second most common variety of primary bone cancer to afflict adolescents and young adults. Multi-disciplinary care incorporating advances in diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation has substantially improved the survival rate of patients with localized Ewing sarcoma to nearly 70%. Unfortunately, those advances have not significantly changed the long-term outcome for those with metastatic or recurrent disease; 5-year survival remains less than 25%. This apparent therapeutic plateau exists despite extensive effort during the last four decades to optimize the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy through combination of chemotherapies of mechanistically diverse action, dose-dense scheduling (provided as frequently as every 2 weeks), increased adjuvant treatment duration, and higher dosage per cycle (facilitated with parallel strides in supportive care incorporating growth factors). As has already occurred for malignancies such as breast or colon cancer, the ""-omics-based"" revolution has enhanced our understanding of the molecular changes responsible for Ewing's tumor formation and identified a number of potential targets (such as IGF-1R or mTOR) amenable to biological therapy. It has also created both a challenge and an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers capable of selecting patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapy.

The rationale and development of therapeutic insulin-like growth factor axis inhibition for lung and other cancers.,Clinical lung cancer,Clin Lung Cancer,2009-07-01,"The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis involves elements of endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine control. It is centrally involved in normal development and growth. Core signaling is driven through the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in either homo-multimeric complexes or hetero-multimeric complexes with the insulin receptor (IR). Signaling is affected by a large number of upstream and downstream factors, including the differential expression of various intracellular IR substrates, a range of stimulatory ligands (insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2), the expression of specific clearance receptors (eg, IGF-2R), and different IGF-binding proteins. Considerable evidence exists to implicate aspects of the IGF axis in the development and maintenance of many different nonneoplastic and neoplastic diseases, including both small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A large number of different anticancer strategies directed against the IGF axis are being developed. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the IGF-1R are the furthest advanced clinically. Hyperglycemia appears to be a class effect. To date, the major difference among the antibodies used in clinical trials seems to be their plasma half-lives, leading to a number of different administration regimens being taken forward.

Irinotecan and temozolomide for Ewing sarcoma: the Memorial Sloan-Kettering experience.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2009-12-01,"The prognosis for recurrent/progressive Ewing sarcoma (ES) remains poor. Pre-clinical, adult phase I and II trials have demonstrated the combination of irinotecan and temozolomide to have schedule-dependent synergy and significant antitumor activity. A pediatric phase I trial has shown this regimen to be safe and active in advanced ES. We conducted a retrospective chart review to identify patients with recurrent/progressive ES treated with irinotecan [20 mg/m(2)/day x 5(x2)] and temozolomide (100 mg/m(2)/day x 5) in our institution. The best response achieved, time to progression (TTP), and associated toxicities were recorded. Twenty patients received a total of 154 cycles of therapy. Of 19 evaluable patients, there were 5 complete and 7 partial responses (a 63% overall objective response). Median TTP for 20 evaluable patients with recurrent/progressive ES was 8.3 months; for the subset of 14 patients with recurrent ES, it was 16.2 months. Median TTP was better for patients who sustained a 2-year first remission than for those who relapsed < 24 months from diagnosis and for patients with primary localized vs. metastatic disease. Significant toxicities included grade 3 diarrhea (7 cycles), grade 3 colitis (1 cycle), grade 3 pneumonitis in one patient receiving concurrent whole-lung RT, grade 3-4 neutropenia (19 cycles), and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (16 cycles).

""Spindle cell"" is a descriptive phrase that denotes the cellular shape of many of the sarcomas encountered in the adult population. As a result, they are usually treated differently from small round cell sarcomas, and have different biological characteristics than those tumors and sarcomas with epithelioid morphology. As a very broad generalization, sarcomas with a spindle cell microscopic morphology occur in adults and are treated primarily with surgery and often adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiation as primary therapy. In comparison to small round cell sarcomas such as Ewing sarcoma, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial, and the sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is highly variable.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor enhances the bioavailability of oral irinotecan in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2009-08-17,"To assess the maximum-tolerated dosages (MTDs), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib and of intravenous (IV) irinotecan when administered together in children with refractory solid tumors. To assess the effect of gefitinib on the pharmacokinetics of IV irinotecan and on the bioavailability of a single oral dose of irinotecan. IV irinotecan (15 or 20 mg/m(2)) was given daily for 5 days of 2 consecutive weeks. Oral gefitinib (150 or 112.5 mg/m(2)) was concomitantly given daily for 12 or 21 days. A single oral dose of irinotecan was given on day 9 of course 2 to allow pharmacokinetic analysis. The study enrolled 29 patients with recurrent solid tumors. The 21-day regimen of oral gefitinib with irinotecan was not tolerated. Diarrhea was the most common DLT. The MTD of the combination regimen was 15 mg/m(2)/d of IV irinotecan for 5 days of 2 consecutive weeks and 112.5 mg/m(2)/d of gefitinib given for 12 days. Gefitinib increased the bioavailability of oral irinotecan by four-fold over that observed in historical controls (median, 0.09 v 0.42; P < .000001), reducing the apparent clearance (an inverse measure of exposure) of irinotecan and SN-38 by 37% and 38%, respectively (P < .0001).

Flow cytometric detection of Ewing sarcoma cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2010-01-01,"A new method for detecting circulating Ewing sarcoma cells using flow cytometry is described. This strategy exploits the nearly universal expression of CD99 and the lack of expression of CD45 by Ewing sarcoma cells. Ewing sarcoma cell line A673, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were stained for CD99 and CD45 in order to detect CD99+CD45- cells by flow cytometry. Known quantities of A673 Ewing sarcoma cells were spiked into control PBMCs to test the accuracy of this method. Control PBMCs were evaluated to assess the level of background staining. Flow cytometry was accurate at frequencies as low as one A673 cell per 500,000 PBMCs. The background rate of CD99+CD45- cell detection was low in PBMCs from nine healthy volunteers (median 0.0001% of total cells; range 0-0.00046%) and was further reduced by incorporating stains to exclude dead cells, progenitor cells, and monocytes. In one subject with newly diagnosed localized Ewing sarcoma, CD99+CD45- cells were detected in both blood (0.0021%) and bone marrow (0.048%).

ZNF93 increases resistance to ET-743 (Trabectedin; Yondelis) and PM00104 (Zalypsis) in human cancer cell lines.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2009-09-09,"ET-743 (trabectedin, Yondelis) and PM00104 (Zalypsis) are marine derived compounds that have antitumor activity. ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood. Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 (CS-1/ER) or PM00104 (CS-1/PR) were established in this study. The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin. Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines. We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line. 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing; 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing. Three zinc finger protein (ZNF) genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells. Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR. ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant Ewing sarcoma cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line, but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines. ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Furthermore, ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743, PM00104 and cisplatin. This study suggests that zinc finger proteins, and ZNF93 in particular, are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104.",Journal Article,3786.0,15.0,ET-743 trabectedin Yondelis and PM00104 Zalypsis are marine derived compounds that have antitumor activity ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 CS-1/ER or PM00104 CS-1/PR were established in this study The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing Three zinc finger protein ZNF genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant cancer cell line but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743 PM00104 and cisplatin Furthermore ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743 PM00104 and cisplatin This study suggests that zinc finger proteins and ZNF93 in particular are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[2022, 8172, 5110, 33639, 2, 28947, 45688, 32, 8178, 526, 2411, 17, 47, 579, 128, 2022, 8172, 2, 28947, 645, 252, 2275, 3338, 1, 24, 303, 757, 4, 3, 193, 1, 234, 251, 84, 3, 483, 92, 1122, 6, 251, 32, 44, 1145, 1784, 171, 6116, 31, 285, 436, 6, 2022, 8172, 2188, 14, 516, 15, 28947, 2188, 14, 998, 11, 635, 4, 26, 45, 3, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 2188, 14, 998, 1416, 1383, 251, 6, 540, 2, 2116, 84, 44, 6, 856, 171, 5318, 145, 4222, 3923, 11, 95, 6, 1004, 580, 145, 55, 4, 46, 31, 285, 21, 204, 17, 8, 375, 207, 1, 214, 47, 1495, 55, 148, 4, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 2188, 14, 998, 198, 72, 6, 3, 3418, 31, 328, 11442, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 8928, 2188, 14, 998, 214, 11, 108, 22, 2810, 13292, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 15746, 2188, 14, 998, 2680, 11, 108, 22, 44093, 169, 5988, 8079, 178, 25186, 214, 11, 23, 3, 3150, 79, 1711, 214, 4754, 46, 214, 47, 44, 85, 373, 41, 5, 234, 251, 4, 30, 37, 1777, 4249, 1, 31512, 2, 58237, 214, 11, 557, 4, 110, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 2188, 14, 998, 436, 31, 285, 20, 1589, 98, 240, 604, 31512, 10, 1711, 4, 100, 2022, 8172, 436, 31, 285, 22, 149, 22, 4, 8, 540, 436, 12, 31, 328, 84, 10, 44, 1711, 4, 490, 436, 31, 285, 31512, 1563, 20, 1919, 4, 2188, 14, 516, 2, 2188, 14, 998, 1546, 101, 485, 9, 2022, 8172, 28947, 2, 540, 798, 31512, 3245, 2188, 14, 37, 32, 1352, 436, 6, 2022, 8172, 28947, 2, 540, 26, 45, 844, 17, 5988, 8079, 652, 2, 31512, 4, 1454, 32, 646, 4, 251, 6, 2022, 8172, 2, 28947]",1674.0,"['trabectedin', 'yondelis', 'pm', 'zalypsis', 'marine', 'derived', 'compound', 'antitumor', 'activity', 'pm', 'exposure', 'sustained', 'period', 'treatment', 'development', 'drug', 'resistance', 'mechanism', 'lead', 'resistance', 'understood', 'human', 'chondrosarcoma', 'line', 'resistant', 'er', 'pm', 'pr', 'established', 'er', 'pr', 'exhibited', 'cross', 'resistance', 'cisplatin', 'methotrexate', 'doxorubicin', 'human', 'affymetrix', 'chip', 'array', 'examine', 'relative', 'expression', 'line', 'large', 'number', 'altered', 'expression', 'level', 'er', 'pr', 'compared', 'parental', 'line', 'er', 'pr', 'identified', 'overexpressing', 'er', 'pr', 'transcript', 'identified', 'underexpressing', 'zinc', 'finger', 'znf', 'overexpressed', 'list', 'previously', 'associated', 'drug', 'resistance', 'differential', 'expression', 'znf', 'znf', 'confirmed', 'er', 'pr', 'resistant', 'line', 'real', 'time', 'rt', 'pcr', 'znf', 'wa', 'overexpressed', 'resistant', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'cisplatin', 'resistant', 'ovarian', 'line', 'wa', 'overexpressed', 'paclitaxel', 'resistant', 'line', 'znf', 'knockdown', 'sirna', 'er', 'pr', 'caused', 'increased', 'sensitivity', 'pm', 'cisplatin', 'furthermore', 'znf', 'transfected', 'relatively', 'resistant', 'pm', 'cisplatin', 'suggests', 'zinc', 'finger', 'znf', 'particular', 'involved', 'resistance', 'pm']",19742314,158,0.728110599078341

ES and OS of the spine are currently managed with multimodality treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical resection. It is currently unclear if extent of resection, for example, intralesional resection versus marginal or wide resection has an impact on survival or local control of disease. A systematic literature search for the years 1960 to 2008 was performed looking at publications involving treatment of spinal ES and OS. From these 208 articles, 16 were selected for analysis and were reviewed in depth. Studies were presented to a group of spinal oncology experts. Literature was graded for quality, summarized and presented to an international expert group with consensus recommendations generated. For ES of the spine, 10 studies were analyzed. For OS of the spine, 6 studies were analyzed. For both ES and OS of the spine, moderate level evidence supported a strong recommendation that neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers significant improvements in local control and long-term survival and is essential in multimodality management. For spinal ES, very low level evidence supported a weak recommendation that en bloc surgical resection provides improved local control, but not improved overall survival. Radiation therapy for spinal ES may also be used for local control either alone or to supplement incomplete resection. For spinal OS, very low evidence supported a strong recommendation that en bloc resection provides improved local control and potentially improved overall survival. Patients with ES and OS are currently managed with multiple modalities involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. For both histopathologies, advances in chemotherapy have led to the greatest improvements in survival over the last few decades.

Late recurrence in pediatric cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2009-12-01,"An increasing percentage of childhood cancer patients are surviving their disease, but there is limited research on late recurrence. We sought to estimate late recurrence rates for the most common pediatric cancers and to determine risk factors for late recurrence. The incidence of late recurrences, or first recurrences that occurred more than 5 years after diagnosis, was analyzed for the most common pediatric cancers using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a retrospective cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood and adolescent cancers who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. A total of 12,795 survivors with no history of recurrence within 5 years after their original cancer diagnosis were included in the analysis, with a total of 217,127 person-years of follow-up. Cumulative incidence of late recurrence at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after diagnosis was calculated using death as a competing risk. Adjusted relative rates of late recurrence were obtained using multivariable Poisson regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Overall, 5-year survivors of pediatric cancers experienced a cumulative incidence of recurrent disease of 4.4%, 5.6%, and 6.2% at 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Cumulative incidence varied by diagnosis: Survivors of Ewing sarcoma and astrocytoma had the highest 20-year cumulative incidences at 13.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.4 to 16.5) and 14.4% (95% CI = 12.3 to 16.6), respectively. In multivariable analysis, the greatest risk factors for late recurrence included diagnosis, combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, earlier treatment era, and fewer years since diagnosis (P < .001 for all). Late recurrence is a risk for some pediatric cancers.

Angiogenesis and vascular targeting in Ewing sarcoma: a review of preclinical and clinical data.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-02-01,"Ewing sarcoma is the second most common type of bone cancer in children and young adults. In recent years, the mechanisms by which these tumors develop and maintain their vascular supply have been elucidated.

Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2009-12-23,"Figitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody targeting the insulin-like growth-factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Preclinical data suggest a dependence on insulin-like growth-factor signalling for sarcoma subtypes, including Ewing's sarcoma, and early reports show antitumour activity of IGF-1R-targeting drugs in these diseases. Between January, 2006, and August, 2008, patients with refractory, advanced sarcomas received figitumumab (20 mg/kg) in two single-stage expansion cohorts within a solid-tumour phase 1 trial. The first cohort (n=15) included patients with multiple sarcoma subtypes, age 18 years or older, and the second cohort (n=14) consisted of patients with refractory Ewing's sarcoma, age 9 years or older. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and tolerability of figitumumab. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic profiling and preliminary antitumour activity (best response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST]) in evaluable patients who received at least one dose of medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00474760. 29 patients, 16 of whom had Ewing's sarcoma, were enrolled and received a total of 177 cycles of treatment (median 2, mean 6.1, range 1-24). Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis, grade 3 back pain, and grade 3 vomiting were each noted once in individual patients; one patient had grade 3 increases in aspartate aminotransferase and gammaglutamyltransferase concentrations. This patient also had grade 4 increases in alanine aminotransferase concentrations. The only other grade 4 adverse event was raised concentrations of uric acid, noted in one patient. Pharmacokinetics were comparable between patients with sarcoma and those with other solid tumours. 28 patients were assessed for response; two patients, both with Ewing's sarcoma, had objective responses (one complete response and one partial response) and eight patients had disease stabilisation (six with Ewing's sarcoma, one with synovial sarcoma, and one with fibrosarcoma) lasting 4 months or longer.

Ethnic and racial differences in patients with Ewing sarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-02-01,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) was a malignant tumor of bone or soft tissue. One of the few risk factors for developing ES is race, with a higher incidence noted in populations of European rather than African or Asian ancestry. The goal of the current study was to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in presentation and overall survival (OS) among patients diagnosed with ES before age 40 years. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database identified 1715 patients aged <40 years who were diagnosed with ES between 1973 and 2005. Racial and ethnic group differences were compared using chi-square tests. OS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank tests and Cox models. Black patients had significantly more soft-tissue tumors compared with white non-Hispanic patients (P <.0001). Asian and white Hispanic patients were found to have an intermediate frequency of soft-tissue tumors that also differed from white non-Hispanic patients (P <.0001). White Hispanic patients presented with a higher proportion of larger tumors compared with white non-Hispanic patients (P = .042). Black patients tended to be older than white non-Hispanic patients (P = .012). Sex, frequency of pelvic tumors, and metastatic status did not appear to differ by ethnicity or race. OS was found to differ according to race and ethnicity. Even after controlling for known confounders, OS was significantly worse for black, Asian, and white Hispanic patients compared with white non-Hispanic patients (P = .0031, P = .0182, and P = .0051, respectively).

Cancer Res.,2010-04-06,"A phase I study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of R1507-a fully human IgG1 type monoclonal antibody directed against the human insulin-like growth factor-I receptor. Patients with advanced solid tumors were assigned to receive i.v. R1507 weekly (qW), starting with 1 mg/kg. Subsequent cohorts were dosed at 3 and then 9 mg/kg. An additional 12 patients received 9 mg/kg R1507 qW. Patients remained on the study until the development of a dose-limiting toxicity or progressive disease. In total, 37 patients were treated with R1507 qW. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The pharmacokinetics of R1507 were characterized by a slow clearance and limited volume of distribution, with an estimated elimination half-life justifying weekly administration. Serum IGF-I ligand levels increased proportionally to dose during the first 72 hours in all cohorts. R1507 was well tolerated.

ERG rearrangement is specific to prostate cancer and does not occur in any other common tumor.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2010-05-14,"Identification of specific somatic gene alterations is crucial for the insight into the development, progression, and clinical behavior of individual cancer types. The recently discovered recurrent ERG rearrangement in prostate cancer might represent a prostate cancer-specific alteration that has not been systematically assessed in tumors other than prostate cancer. Aim of this study was to assess, whether the ERG rearrangement and the distinct deletion site between TMPRSS2 and ERG, both predominantly resulting in a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, occur in tumors other than prostate cancer. We assessed 54 different tumor types (2942 samples in total) for their ERG rearrangement status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To calibrate, we analyzed 285 prostate cancer samples for the ERG rearrangement frequency. Additionally, we interrogated a high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set across 3131 cancer specimens (26 tumor types) for copy number alterations. None of the 54 different tumor types assessed by FISH harbored an ERG rearrangement, whereas the prostate cancer samples revealed an ERG rearrangement in 49.5% of cases. Furthermore, within the 26 tumor types assessed for copy number alterations by SNP, the distinct deletion site between TMPRSS2 and ERG (21q22.2-3) was detectable exclusively in prostate cancer. Although Ewing's sarcoma and AML have known rearrangements rarely involving ERG, we hypothesize that the ERG rearrangement as well as the distinct deletion site on 21q22.2-3 between TMPRSS2 and ERG are prostate-cancer-specific genomic alterations.

At 30 years after childhood cancer diagnosis, we calculated cumulative incidence at 30 years of subsequent neoplasms and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risks (EARs) for invasive second malignant neoplasms, and relative risks for subsequent neoplasms by use of multivariable Poisson regression.

Long-term survivors of childhood Ewing sarcoma: report from the childhood cancer survivor study.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2010-07-23,"The survival of Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients has improved since the 1970s but is associated with considerable future health risks. The study population consisted of long-term (> or =5-year) survivors of childhood ES diagnosed before age 21 from 1970 to 1986. Cause-specific mortality was evaluated in eligible survivors (n = 568), and subsequent malignant neoplasms, chronic health conditions, infertility, and health status were evaluated in the subset participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (n = 403). Outcomes were compared with the US population and sibling control subjects (n = 3899). Logistic, Poisson, or Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustments for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and potential intrafamily correlation, were used. Statistical tests were two-sided. Cumulative mortality of ES survivors was 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 21.1 to 28.9) 25 years after diagnosis. The all-cause standardized mortality ratio was 13.3 (95% CI = 11.2 to 15.8) overall, 23.1 (95% CI = 17.6 to 29.7) for women, and 10.0 (95% CI = 7.9 to 12.5) for men. The nonrecurrence-progression non-external cause standardized mortality ratio (subsequent non-ES malignant neoplasms and cardiac and pulmonary causes potentially attributable to ES treatment) was 8.7 (95% CI = 6.2 to 12.0). Twenty-five years after ES diagnosis, cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers, was 9.0% (95% CI = 5.8 to 12.2). Compared with siblings, survivors had an increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or disabling chronic health conditions (relative risk = 6.0, 95% CI = 4.1 to 9.0). Survivors had lower fertility rates (women: P = .005; men: P < .001) and higher rates of moderate to extreme adverse health status (P < .001).

Chest wall Ewing sarcoma family of tumors: long-term outcomes.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol.

Of the patients, 22 were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone, and 17 patients were treated with surgery with or without RT. Of 9 patients with metastatic disease, 8 were treated with RT alone. The risk profiles of each group were otherwise similar. The median age was 16.6 years, and the most frequent primary site was the rib (n=17). The median potential follow-up was 19.2 years. The 5-year actuarial overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and local control (LC) rates were 34%, 34%, and 72%, respectively. For the nonmetastatic subset (n=30), the 5-year OS, CSS, and LC rates were 44%, 44%, and 79%, respectively. LC was not statistically significantly different between patients treated with RT alone (61%) vs. surgery+RT (75%). None of the 4 patients treated with surgery alone experienced local failure. No patient or treatment variable was significantly associated with local failure. Of the patients, 26% experienced Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 3+ toxicity, including 2 pulmonary deaths. Modern intensive systemic therapy helped increase the 5-year CSS from 7% to 49% in patients treated after 1984 (p=0.03).

Comparison of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in pediatric sarcoma patients when given with dexrazoxane versus as continuous infusion.,Pediatric hematology and oncology,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,2010-10-01,"Doxorubicin is an effective agent for many malignancies. To limit cardiotoxicity, doxorubicin can be given as prolonged infusion (PIDX) or bolus infusion following dexrazoxane (DZX). The authors report their institutional experience comparing PIDX and DZX in a sarcoma cohort. Retrospective record review for newly diagnosed sarcoma patients at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from June 1998 to June 2006. There were 23 Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) patients treated with DZX and 40 osteosarcoma (OS) patients treated with PIDX. The DZX group had higher mean cumulative anthracycline dose (510 mg/m(2) [SD 120 mg/m(2)] versus 414 mg/m(2) [SD 99 mg/m(2)], P = .002), however mean lowest left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) values were higher for DZX (52.5% [SD 5.6%] versus 47.2% [SD 10.9%], P = .014).

ETV1 is a lineage survival factor that cooperates with KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumours.,Nature,Nature,2010-10-03,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is the most common human sarcoma and is primarily defined by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases. KIT is highly expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs)-the presumed cell of origin for GIST-as well as in haematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, mast cells and germ cells. Yet, families harbouring germline activating KIT mutations and mice with knock-in Kit mutations almost exclusively develop ICC hyperplasia and GIST, suggesting that the cellular context is important for KIT to mediate oncogenesis. Here we show that the ETS family member ETV1 is highly expressed in the subtypes of ICCs sensitive to oncogenic KIT mediated transformation, and is required for their development. In addition, ETV1 is universally highly expressed in GISTs and is required for growth of imatinib-sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines. Transcriptome profiling and global analyses of ETV1-binding sites suggest that ETV1 is a master regulator of an ICC-GIST-specific transcription network mainly through enhancer binding. The ETV1 transcriptional program is further regulated by activated KIT, which prolongs ETV1 protein stability and cooperates with ETV1 to promote tumorigenesis. We propose that GIST arises from ICCs with high levels of endogenous ETV1 expression that, when coupled with an activating KIT mutation, drives an oncogenic ETS transcriptional program. This differs from other ETS-dependent tumours such as prostate cancer, melanoma and Ewing sarcoma where genomic translocation or amplification drives aberrant ETS expression. It also represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic transcription factor activation.",Journal Article,3397.0,183.0,stromal tumour GIST is the most common human and is primarily defined by activating mutations in the KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases KIT is highly expressed in interstitial cells of Cajal ICCs -the presumed cell of origin for GIST-as well as in haematopoietic stem cells melanocytes mast cells and germ cells Yet families harbouring germline activating KIT mutations and mice with knock-in Kit mutations almost exclusively develop ICC hyperplasia and GIST suggesting that the cellular context is important for KIT to mediate oncogenesis Here we show that the ETS family member ETV1 is highly expressed in the subtypes of ICCs sensitive to oncogenic KIT mediated transformation and is required for their development In addition ETV1 is universally highly expressed in GISTs and is required for growth of imatinib-sensitive and resistant GIST cell lines Transcriptome profiling and global analyses of ETV1-binding sites suggest that ETV1 is a master regulator of an ICC-GIST-specific transcription network mainly through enhancer binding The ETV1 transcriptional program is further regulated by activated KIT which prolongs ETV1 protein stability and cooperates with ETV1 to promote tumorigenesis We propose that GIST arises from ICCs with high levels of endogenous ETV1 expression that when coupled with an activating KIT mutation drives an oncogenic ETS transcriptional program This differs from other ETS-dependent tumours such as cancer and where genomic translocation or amplification drives aberrant ETS expression It also represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic transcription factor activation,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1126, 770, 1394, 16, 3, 96, 186, 171, 2, 16, 1561, 395, 20, 1616, 138, 4, 3, 1164, 15, 4006, 153, 564, 1549, 1164, 16, 561, 570, 4, 4543, 37, 1, 18848, 17417, 3, 5472, 31, 1, 1938, 9, 1394, 22, 149, 22, 4, 7274, 452, 37, 7642, 5563, 37, 2, 2280, 37, 1145, 1954, 10872, 1009, 1616, 1164, 138, 2, 399, 5, 6252, 4, 1164, 138, 2214, 4437, 690, 2259, 3176, 2, 1394, 802, 17, 3, 763, 1533, 16, 305, 9, 1164, 6, 3367, 4503, 467, 21, 514, 17, 3, 4802, 607, 2693, 9298, 16, 561, 570, 4, 3, 814, 1, 17417, 745, 6, 1302, 1164, 517, 1392, 2, 16, 616, 9, 136, 193, 4, 352, 9298, 16, 6813, 561, 570, 4, 2508, 2, 16, 616, 9, 129, 1, 577, 745, 2, 436, 1394, 31, 285, 3917, 1080, 2, 1648, 318, 1, 9298, 791, 633, 309, 17, 9298, 16, 8, 7561, 2452, 1, 35, 2259, 1394, 112, 866, 1801, 2615, 298, 4239, 791, 3, 9298, 1431, 1243, 16, 195, 1065, 20, 735, 1164, 92, 5613, 9298, 178, 2769, 2, 12535, 5, 9298, 6, 1617, 1565, 21, 2548, 17, 1394, 6053, 29, 17417, 5, 64, 148, 1, 2682, 9298, 55, 17, 198, 3332, 5, 35, 1616, 1164, 258, 5267, 35, 1302, 4802, 1431, 1243, 26, 4990, 29, 127, 4802, 470, 1319, 225, 22, 12, 2, 1257, 572, 2006, 15, 1073, 5267, 1898, 4802, 55, 192, 120, 1449, 8, 229, 670, 1, 1302, 866, 161, 363]",1608.0,"['stromal', 'tumour', 'gist', 'common', 'human', 'sarcoma', 'primarily', 'defined', 'activating', 'kit', 'pdgfra', 'receptor', 'tyrosine', 'kinase', 'kit', 'highly', 'expressed', 'interstitial', 'cajal', 'icc', 'presumed', 'origin', 'gist', 'haematopoietic', 'stem', 'melanocyte', 'mast', 'germ', 'family', 'harbouring', 'germline', 'activating', 'kit', 'mouse', 'knock', 'kit', 'exclusively', 'develop', 'icc', 'hyperplasia', 'gist', 'suggesting', 'cellular', 'context', 'important', 'kit', 'mediate', 'oncogenesis', 'ets', 'family', 'member', 'etv', 'highly', 'expressed', 'subtypes', 'icc', 'sensitive', 'oncogenic', 'kit', 'mediated', 'transformation', 'required', 'development', 'addition', 'etv', 'universally', 'highly', 'expressed', 'gist', 'required', 'growth', 'imatinib', 'sensitive', 'resistant', 'gist', 'line', 'transcriptome', 'profiling', 'global', 'etv', 'binding', 'site', 'suggest', 'etv', 'master', 'regulator', 'icc', 'gist', 'specific', 'transcription', 'network', 'mainly', 'enhancer', 'binding', 'etv', 'transcriptional', 'program', 'regulated', 'activated', 'kit', 'prolongs', 'etv', 'stability', 'cooperates', 'etv', 'promote', 'tumorigenesis', 'propose', 'gist', 'arises', 'icc', 'high', 'level', 'endogenous', 'etv', 'expression', 'coupled', 'activating', 'kit', 'drive', 'oncogenic', 'ets', 'transcriptional', 'program', 'differs', 'ets', 'dependent', 'tumour', 'prostate', 'melanoma', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'genomic', 'translocation', 'amplification', 'drive', 'aberrant', 'ets', 'expression', 'represents', 'novel', 'mechanism', 'oncogenic', 'transcription', 'factor', 'activation']",20927104,4,0.018433179723502304
Ewing tumors that do not overexpress BMI-1 are a distinct molecular subclass with variant biology: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2010-11-03,"Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) are aggressive tumors of putative stem cell origin for which prognostic biomarkers and novel treatments are needed. In several human cancers, high expression of the polycomb protein BMI-1 is associated with poor outcome. We have assessed the potential clinical significance of BMI-1 expression level in ESFT. BMI-1 expression was assessed in 130 tumors by immunostaining and associations with clinical features and outcome determined. The molecular signatures of BMI-1-low and BMI-1-high tumors were compared using microarrays and differentially activated canonical pathways identified by gene-specific enrichment analysis. Automated quantitative analysis of phosphoproteins was used to assess relative levels of pathway activation. Sensitivity to IGF1-R inhibition was determined using MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assays. BMI-1 is overexpressed by the vast majority of ESFTs. However, in 20% of cases, BMI-1 levels are low to undetectable. Significantly, although clinical presentation and outcome were similar between BMI-1-high and BMI-1-low tumors, whole genome expression array analysis showed marked differences in their respective gene expression profiles. Gene-specific enrichment analysis identified that several cancer-associated canonical biological pathways, including IGF1, mTOR, and WNT, are significantly downregulated in BMI-1-low compared with BMI-1-high tumors. Consistent with these in vivo data, the response to IGF1-R inhibition in vitro was diminished in BMI-1-low compared with BMI-1-high ESFT cells.

Association of the highly prevalent TP53 R337H mutation with pediatric choroid plexus carcinoma and osteosarcoma in southeast Brazil.,Cancer,Cancer,2010-12-29,"The inherited, low-penetrance arginine-to-histidine substitution at codon 337 (R337H) of the tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) is clustered in southeast Brazil (estimated frequency, 0.3%). Although its tumorigenic effect initially appeared to be tissue-specific, recent evidence suggests its association with a broader range of tumors. Therefore, the authors of this report investigated the spectrum of pediatric malignancies associated with the TP53 R337H mutation at a single referral institution in southeast Brazil. Genomic DNA samples from 493 children with malignancies were screened for the R337H mutation. Available tumor samples from carriers were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and nuclear p53 accumulation. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Sixty-five of 70 patients (93%) with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), 9 of 13 patients (69%) with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC), and 3 of 41 patients (7.3%) with osteosarcoma carried the mutation. The proportion of CPC to choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was much higher than that reported elsewhere. Osteosarcoma in carriers had a significantly poorer outcome (P = .02). The mutation was not identified in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 187), recurrent ALL (n = 49), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 44), lymphoma (n = 30), non-CPC central nervous system tumors (n = 26), Ewing sarcoma (n = 25), or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 8).

Racial differences in the incidence of mesenchymal tumors associated with EWSR1 translocation.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev.,2011-01-06,"The incidence of Ewing sarcoma varies by race, with very low rates among persons of African and East Asian ancestry. The incidence by race of other mesenchymal tumors that also harbor EWSR1 translocations has not been studied.

Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for white, African American, and Asian/Native American populations and compared statistically. Ewing sarcoma was significantly less common in the African American and Asian/Native American populations compared with the white population, with incidence rate ratios of 0.12 (95% CI, 0.08-0.20; P<0.001) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.41-0.69; P<0.001), respectively.

Targeted morphoproteomic profiling of Ewing's sarcoma treated with insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitors: response/resistance signatures.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2011-04-06,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) targeted therapies have resulted in responses in a small number of patients with advanced metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. We performed morphoproteomic profiling to better understand response/resistance mechanisms of Ewing's sarcoma to IGF1R inhibitor-based therapy. This pilot study assessed two patients with advanced Ewing's sarcoma treated with IGF1R antibody alone followed by combined IGF1R inhibitor plus mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor treatment once resistance to single-agent IGF1R inhibitor developed. Immunohistochemical probes were applied to detect p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-Akt (Ser473), p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), nestin, and p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) in the original and recurrent tumor. The initial remarkable radiographic responses to IGF1R-antibody therapy was followed by resistance and then response to combined IGF1R plus mTOR inhibitor therapy in both patients, and then resistance to the combination regimen in one patient. In patient 1, upregulation of p-Akt and p-mTOR in the tumor that relapsed after initial response to IGF1R antibody might explain the resistance that developed, and the subsequent response to combined IGF1R plus mTOR inhibitor therapy. In patient 2, upregulation of mTOR was seen in the primary tumor, perhaps explaining the initial response to the IGF1R and mTOR inhibitor combination, while the resistant tumor that emerged showed activation of the ERK pathway as well. Morphoproteomic analysis revealed that the mTOR pathway was activated in these two patients with advanced Ewing's sarcoma who showed response to combined IGF1R and mTOR inhibition, and the ERK pathway in the patient in whom resistance to this combination emerged.

Dose escalation of intravenous irinotecan using oral cefpodoxime: a phase I study in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-04-20,"Administration of an oral cephalosporin allowed advancement of the dosage of oral irinotecan. This study investigates whether administration of an oral cephalosporin increases the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous irinotecan. Irinotecan was administered intravenously on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of a 21-day cycle with continuous oral cefpodoxime starting 2 days prior to irinotecan. Cohorts of 3-6 pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors were enrolled at 4 dosage levels, starting at the single-agent irinotecan MTD of 20 mg/m(2) /dose. The 17 evaluable patients received 39 courses of therapy. None of the patients treated with 20 mg/m(2) /dose experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). One of six patients treated at 30 mg/m(2) /dose experienced dose-limiting neutropenia. Two of three patients treated with 45 mg/m(2) /dose and two of five treated with 40 mg/m(2) /dose experienced dose-limiting diarrhea, with associated dehydration and anorexia. Two unconfirmed partial responses were observed after one course in a patient with Ewing sarcoma and one with paraganglioma. A child with refractory neuroblastoma had disease stabilization through 12 courses of therapy. Median (range) systemic exposure to SN-38 at the MTD (30 mg/m(2) /dose) was 67 ng-h/mL (36 to 111 ng-h/mL). The MTD of intravenous irinotecan administered on a protracted schedule was increased by 50% from 20 to 30 mg/m(2) /dose with the addition of oral cefpodoxime. The most prominent DLT remained diarrhea. High interpatient variability in irinotecan pharmacokinetics was observed; however, SN-38 exposure at the MTD was greater than most reported exposures with the 20 mg/m(2) dosage.","Clinical Trial, Phase I",3198.0,16.0,Administration of an oral cephalosporin allowed advancement of the dosage of oral irinotecan This study investigates whether administration of an oral cephalosporin increases the maximum tolerated dose MTD of intravenous irinotecan Irinotecan was administered intravenously on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of a 21-day cycle with continuous oral cefpodoxime starting 2 days prior to irinotecan Cohorts of 3-6 pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors were enrolled at 4 dosage levels starting at the single-agent irinotecan MTD of 20 mg/m 2 /dose The 17 evaluable patients received 39 courses of therapy None of the patients treated with 20 mg/m 2 /dose experienced dose-limiting toxicity DLT One of six patients treated at 30 mg/m 2 /dose experienced dose-limiting neutropenia Two of three patients treated with 45 mg/m 2 /dose and two of five treated with 40 mg/m 2 /dose experienced dose-limiting diarrhea with associated dehydration and anorexia Two unconfirmed partial responses were observed after one course in a patient with and one with paraganglioma A child with refractory had disease stabilization through 12 courses of therapy Median range systemic exposure to SN-38 at the MTD 30 mg/m 2 /dose was 67 ng-h/mL 36 to 111 ng-h/mL The MTD of intravenous irinotecan administered on a protracted schedule was increased by 50 from 20 to 30 mg/m 2 /dose with the addition of oral cefpodoxime The most prominent DLT remained diarrhea High interpatient variability in irinotecan pharmacokinetics was observed however SN-38 exposure at the MTD was greater than most reported exposures with the 20 mg/m 2 dosage,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[634, 1, 35, 518, 19153, 2313, 7496, 1, 3, 3323, 1, 518, 1071, 26, 45, 7259, 317, 634, 1, 35, 518, 19153, 1106, 3, 689, 421, 61, 961, 1, 1262, 1071, 1071, 10, 468, 1672, 23, 162, 14, 33, 2, 162, 66, 133, 1, 8, 239, 218, 417, 5, 1314, 518, 46544, 1723, 18, 162, 324, 6, 1071, 736, 1, 27, 49, 815, 7, 5, 430, 537, 57, 11, 346, 28, 39, 3323, 148, 1723, 28, 3, 226, 420, 1071, 961, 1, 179, 81, 188, 18, 61, 3, 269, 859, 7, 103, 587, 1993, 1, 36, 1292, 1, 3, 7, 73, 5, 179, 81, 188, 18, 61, 592, 61, 817, 155, 2059, 104, 1, 437, 7, 73, 28, 201, 81, 188, 18, 61, 592, 61, 817, 778, 100, 1, 169, 7, 73, 5, 512, 81, 188, 18, 61, 2, 100, 1, 365, 73, 5, 327, 81, 188, 18, 61, 592, 61, 817, 1172, 5, 41, 5414, 2, 3373, 100, 5971, 450, 253, 11, 164, 50, 104, 906, 4, 8, 69, 5, 2, 104, 5, 6827, 8, 2566, 5, 430, 42, 34, 3184, 298, 133, 1993, 1, 36, 52, 184, 403, 645, 6, 3133, 519, 28, 3, 961, 201, 81, 188, 18, 61, 10, 598, 997, 555, 542, 511, 6, 3167, 997, 555, 542, 3, 961, 1, 1262, 1071, 468, 23, 8, 7053, 1055, 10, 101, 20, 212, 29, 179, 6, 201, 81, 188, 18, 61, 5, 3, 352, 1, 518, 46544, 3, 96, 3689, 2059, 958, 1172, 64, 7423, 1982, 4, 1071, 1159, 10, 164, 137, 3133, 519, 645, 28, 3, 961, 10, 378, 76, 96, 210, 3401, 5, 3, 179, 81, 188, 18, 3323]",1611.0,"['administration', 'oral', 'cephalosporin', 'allowed', 'advancement', 'dosage', 'oral', 'irinotecan', 'investigates', 'administration', 'oral', 'cephalosporin', 'increase', 'maximum', 'tolerated', 'dose', 'mtd', 'intravenous', 'irinotecan', 'irinotecan', 'wa', 'administered', 'intravenously', 'day', 'day', 'day', 'cycle', 'continuous', 'oral', 'cefpodoxime', 'starting', 'day', 'prior', 'irinotecan', 'cohort', 'pediatric', 'patient', 'refractory', 'solid', 'enrolled', 'dosage', 'level', 'starting', 'single', 'agent', 'irinotecan', 'mtd', 'mg', 'dose', 'evaluable', 'patient', 'received', 'course', 'therapy', 'patient', 'treated', 'mg', 'dose', 'experienced', 'dose', 'limiting', 'toxicity', 'dlt', 'patient', 'treated', 'mg', 'dose', 'experienced', 'dose', 'limiting', 'neutropenia', 'patient', 'treated', 'mg', 'dose', 'treated', 'mg', 'dose', 'experienced', 'dose', 'limiting', 'diarrhea', 'associated', 'dehydration', 'anorexia', 'unconfirmed', 'partial', 'response', 'observed', 'course', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'paraganglioma', 'child', 'refractory', 'neuroblastoma', 'disease', 'stabilization', 'course', 'therapy', 'median', 'range', 'systemic', 'exposure', 'sn', 'mtd', 'mg', 'dose', 'wa', 'ng', 'ml', 'ng', 'ml', 'mtd', 'intravenous', 'irinotecan', 'administered', 'protracted', 'schedule', 'wa', 'increased', 'mg', 'dose', 'addition', 'oral', 'cefpodoxime', 'prominent', 'dlt', 'remained', 'diarrhea', 'high', 'interpatient', 'variability', 'irinotecan', 'wa', 'observed', 'sn', 'exposure', 'mtd', 'wa', 'greater', 'reported', 'exposure', 'mg', 'dosage']",21509928,9,0.041474654377880185
Phase 1 clinical trials for sarcomas: the cutting edge.,Current opinion in oncology,Curr Opin Oncol,2011-07-01,"Few standard second-line treatment options exist for advanced sarcoma patients. Some of these patients are offered early-phase clinical trials involving targeted or nontargeted agents. This review outlines recent phase 1 trials involving sarcoma patients, explores current challenges and highlights future opportunities in sarcoma developmental therapeutics. New molecularly targeted phase 1 studies have demonstrated efficacy in sarcomas. For instance, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) antibodies have produced single agent activity in Ewing's sarcoma. Other promising novel agents include an agonist for the apoptosis ligand 2/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) for chondrosarcoma, small molecule inhibitor crizotinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, cedarinib for alveolar soft part sarcoma, and rexin-G, a tumor targeted retrovector for osteosarcoma. In addition, different combinations of chemotherapy in combination with newer agents such as trabectedin exhibited efficacy in advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Patients with refractory sarcoma demonstrate benefit from treatment with targeted drugs even in the setting of phase 1 trials.

Mechanistic rationale for inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in ETS gene fusion-positive prostate cancer.,Cancer cell,Cancer Cell,2011-05-01,"Recurrent fusions of ETS genes are considered driving mutations in a diverse array of cancers, including Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and prostate cancer. We investigate the mechanisms by which ETS fusions mediate their effects, and find that the product of the predominant ETS gene fusion, TMPRSS2:ERG, interacts in a DNA-independent manner with the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). ETS gene-mediated transcription and cell invasion require PARP1 and DNA-PKcs expression and activity. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 inhibits ETS-positive, but not ETS-negative, prostate cancer xenograft growth.

Clinical features and outcomes in patients with extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2011-01-10,"Ewing sarcoma can arise in either bone or soft tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes differ between skeletal Ewing sarcoma and extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES). Patients <40 years of age with Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor reported to the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database from 1973 to 2007 were evaluated based on skeletal (n = 1519) versus extraskeletal (n = 683) site of origin. Patient characteristics were compared using Fisher exact tests. Overall survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients with EES had a higher mean age (19.5 vs 16.3 years; P < .001) and were less likely to be male (53.4% vs 63.3%; P < .001) or white (84.8% vs 92.5%; P < .001) compared with patients with skeletal tumors. Extraskeletal tumors were more likely to arise in axial locations (72.9% vs 54.2%; P = .001) but were less likely to arise specifically in the pelvis (19.8% vs 26.6%; P < .001). Metastatic status or tumor size did not differ by group. Five-year overall survival was superior for localized EES compared with localized skeletal tumors (69.7% vs 62.6%; P = .02).

The objectives of this phase I study were to evaluate the tolerability and activity of temsirolimus and cixutumumab. Patients in sequential cohorts (""3 + 3"" design) received escalating doses of temsirolimus with cixutumumab weekly for 28 days.

Forty-two patients with advanced cancer (19 male/23 female, median age = 53, median number of prior therapies = 4) were enrolled. MTD was reached at cixutumumab, 6 mg/kg IV and temsirolimus, 25 mg IV. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

Intron 7 of EWSR1, the most common site of translocation, was also sequenced in all subjects. Genetic variation between groups was evaluated statistically using exact logistic regression and Fisher exact tests. One SNP in EWSR1 (rs2857461) showed a low level of statistical association with the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma compared to Wilms tumor. The odds ratio for having Ewing sarcoma in people with at least one copy of the minor allele of rs2857461 was 3.57 (95% confidence interval 0.79-21.7; P = 0.07). No other SNPs or variations in intron 7 of EWSR1 were associated with Ewing sarcoma.

Proton radiotherapy for pediatric Ewing's sarcoma: initial clinical outcomes.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2011-08-18,"Proton radiotherapy (PT) has been prescribed similarly to photon radiotherapy to achieve comparable disease control rates at comparable doses. The chief advantage of protons in this setting is to reduce acute and late toxicities by decreasing the amount of normal tissue irradiated. We report the preliminary clinical outcomes including late effects on our pediatric Ewing's sarcoma patients treated with PT at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). This was a retrospective review of the medical records of 30 children with Ewing's sarcoma who were treated with PT between April 2003 and April 2009. A total of 14 male and 16 female patients with tumors in several anatomic sites were treated with PT at a median age of 10 years. The median dose was 54 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) with a median follow-up of 38.4 months. The 3-year actuarial rates of event-free survival, local control, and overall survival were 60%, 86%, and 89%, respectively. PT was acutely well tolerated, with mostly mild-to-moderate skin reactions. At the time of writing, the only serious late effects have been four hematologic malignancies, which are known risks of topoisomerase and anthracyline exposure.

Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance are unknown. We investigated whether an anti-IGF-1R antibody acts via a pathway that could also be suppressed by small interfering (si) RNA against the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein, the hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma. The growth of two Ewing's sarcoma cell lines (TC-32 and TC-71) was inhibited by the fully human anti-IGF-1R antibody, R1507 (clonogenic and MTT assays). TC-32 and TC-71 cells express high levels of IGF-2, while RD-ES and A4573 Ewing's cell lines, which were less responsive to R1507 in our assays, express low or undetectable IGF-2, respectively. TC-71 cells also expressed high levels of IGF-1R, and R1507 decreased steady-state levels of this receptor by internalization/degradation, an effect which was associated with a decrease in p-IGF-1R, p-IRS-1, and p-Akt. EWS/FLI-1 siRNA also decreased p-Akt, due to its ability to increase IGF-BP3 levels and subsequently decrease IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels, thus inhibiting signaling through p-IGF-1R. This inhibition correlated with growth suppression and apoptosis. The attenuation of Akt activation was confirmed in TC-71 and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells by transfecting them with IGF-1R siRNA. We conclude that antibodies and siRNA to IGF-1R, as well as siRNA to EWS/FLI-1, act via intersecting IGF/IGF-1R signals that suppress a common point in this pathway, namely the phosphorylation of Akt.",Journal Article,3024.0,23.0,A subset of patients with 's responds to anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor IGF-1R antibodies Mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance are unknown We investigated whether an anti-IGF-1R antibody acts via a pathway that could also be suppressed by small interfering si RNA against the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein the hallmark of 's The growth of two 's cell lines TC-32 and TC-71 was inhibited by the fully human anti-IGF-1R antibody R1507 clonogenic and MTT assays TC-32 and TC-71 cells express high levels of IGF-2 while RD-ES and A4573 's cell lines which were less responsive to R1507 in our assays express low or undetectable IGF-2 respectively TC-71 cells also expressed high levels of IGF-1R and R1507 decreased steady-state levels of this receptor by internalization/degradation an effect which was associated with a decrease in p-IGF-1R p-IRS-1 and p-Akt EWS/FLI-1 siRNA also decreased p-Akt due to its ability to increase IGF-BP3 levels and subsequently decrease IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels thus inhibiting signaling through p-IGF-1R This inhibition correlated with growth suppression and apoptosis The attenuation of Akt activation was confirmed in TC-71 and HEK-293 human embryonic cells by transfecting them with IGF-1R siRNA We conclude that antibodies and siRNA to IGF-1R as well as siRNA to EWS/FLI-1 act via intersecting IGF/IGF-1R signals that suppress a common point in this pathway namely the phosphorylation of Akt,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[8, 697, 1, 7, 5, 292, 7920, 6, 312, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 14, 153, 1273, 2994, 890, 483, 1, 485, 2, 251, 32, 860, 21, 565, 317, 35, 312, 1273, 2994, 548, 4459, 847, 8, 308, 17, 359, 120, 40, 1908, 20, 302, 3449, 5069, 893, 480, 3, 4528, 18553, 14, 1212, 178, 3, 4683, 1, 292, 3, 129, 1, 100, 292, 31, 285, 3072, 531, 2, 3072, 792, 10, 879, 20, 3, 1910, 171, 312, 1273, 2994, 548, 11873, 3798, 2, 4988, 1013, 3072, 531, 2, 3072, 792, 37, 1669, 64, 148, 1, 1273, 18, 369, 3089, 3011, 2, 45209, 292, 31, 285, 92, 11, 299, 2443, 6, 11873, 4, 114, 1013, 1669, 154, 15, 3920, 1273, 18, 106, 3072, 792, 37, 120, 570, 64, 148, 1, 1273, 2994, 2, 11873, 340, 4152, 1309, 148, 1, 26, 153, 20, 7520, 2373, 35, 254, 92, 10, 41, 5, 8, 775, 4, 19, 1273, 2994, 19, 5056, 14, 2, 19, 649, 4528, 18553, 14, 1919, 120, 340, 19, 649, 520, 6, 211, 801, 6, 344, 1273, 60724, 148, 2, 1611, 775, 1273, 14, 2, 1273, 18, 148, 631, 2062, 314, 298, 19, 1273, 2994, 26, 297, 438, 5, 129, 1332, 2, 351, 3, 5349, 1, 649, 363, 10, 557, 4, 3072, 792, 2, 22528, 7541, 171, 5390, 37, 20, 23384, 1370, 5, 1273, 2994, 1919, 21, 2060, 17, 890, 2, 1919, 6, 1273, 2994, 22, 149, 22, 1919, 6, 4528, 18553, 14, 2559, 847, 34842, 1273, 1273, 2994, 2312, 17, 3134, 8, 186, 741, 4, 26, 308, 5046, 3, 982, 1, 649]",1434.0,"['subset', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'responds', 'anti', 'insulin', 'like', 'growth', 'factor', 'receptor', 'igf', 'antibody', 'mechanism', 'sensitivity', 'resistance', 'unknown', 'investigated', 'anti', 'igf', 'antibody', 'act', 'pathway', 'suppressed', 'small', 'interfering', 'si', 'rna', 'ew', 'fli', 'fusion', 'hallmark', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'growth', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'tc', 'tc', 'wa', 'inhibited', 'fully', 'human', 'anti', 'igf', 'antibody', 'clonogenic', 'mtt', 'tc', 'tc', 'express', 'high', 'level', 'igf', 'rd', 'ewing', 'line', 'le', 'responsive', 'express', 'low', 'undetectable', 'igf', 'respectively', 'tc', 'expressed', 'high', 'level', 'igf', 'decreased', 'steady', 'state', 'level', 'receptor', 'internalization', 'degradation', 'effect', 'wa', 'associated', 'decrease', 'igf', 'irs', 'akt', 'ew', 'fli', 'sirna', 'decreased', 'akt', 'ability', 'increase', 'igf', 'bp', 'level', 'subsequently', 'decrease', 'igf', 'igf', 'level', 'inhibiting', 'signaling', 'igf', 'inhibition', 'correlated', 'growth', 'suppression', 'apoptosis', 'attenuation', 'akt', 'activation', 'wa', 'confirmed', 'tc', 'hek', 'human', 'embryonic', 'kidney', 'transfecting', 'igf', 'sirna', 'conclude', 'antibody', 'sirna', 'igf', 'sirna', 'ew', 'fli', 'act', 'intersecting', 'igf', 'igf', 'signal', 'suppress', 'common', 'point', 'pathway', 'phosphorylation', 'akt']",22022506,5,0.02304147465437788

Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-24,"The type 1 insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT). We conducted a multicenter phase II study of the fully human IGF-1R monoclonal antibody R1507 in patients with recurrent or refractory ESFT. Patients ≥ 2 years of age with refractory or recurrent ESFT received R1507 at doses of 9 mg/kg intravenously one a week or 27 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks. Response was measured by using WHO criteria. Tumor imaging was performed every 6 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks. From December 2007 through April 2010, 115 eligible patients from 31 different institutions were enrolled. The median age was 25 years (range, 8 to 78 years). The location of the primary tumor was bone in 57% of patients and extraskeletal in 43% of patients. A total of 109 patients were treated with R1507 9 mg/kg/wk, and six patients were treated with 27 mg/kg/3 wk. The overall complete response/partial response rate was 10% (95% CI, 4.9% to 16.5%). The median duration of response was 29 weeks (range, 12 to 94 weeks), and the median overall survival was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6 to 9.7 months). Ten of 11 responses were observed in patients who presented with primary bone tumors (P = .016).

Clin. Oncol.,2011-10-24,"Patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) with metastases and those who relapse fare poorly and receive therapies that carry significant toxicity. This phase 1/2 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of figitumumab in advanced ES. Patients with sarcoma 10 to 18 years old were enrolled in two dose escalation cohorts (20 and 30 mg/Kg intravenously every 4 weeks) in the phase 1 portion of the study. Patients with ES 10 years old or older were enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the study. The primary phase 2 objective was objective response rate (ORR). Thirty-one patients with ES (n = 16), osteosarcoma (n = 11), or other sarcomas (n = 4) were enrolled in the phase 1 portion of the study. Dose escalation proceeded to 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks with no dose-limiting toxicity identified. In the phase 2 portion of the study, 107 patients with ES received figitumumab at 30 mg/kg every 4 weeks for a median of 2 cycles (range, 1 to 16).

High prevalence of CIC fusion with double-homeobox (DUX4) transcription factors in EWSR1-negative undifferentiated small blue round cell sarcomas.,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2011-11-10,"Primitive round cell sarcomas of childhood and young adults have been problematic to diagnose and classify. Our goal was to investigate the pathologic and molecular characteristics of small blue round cell tumors (SBRCT) that remained unclassified after exhaustive immunohistochemistry and molecular screening to exclude known sarcoma-related translocations. As rare examples of EWSR1-negative SBRCT have been shown to carry rearrangements for FUS and CIC genes, we undertook a systematic screening for these two genes. CIC rearrangements by FISH were detected in 15/22 (68%), while none showed FUS abnormalities. RACE, RT-PCR, and/or long-range DNA PCR performed in two cases with frozen material showed that CIC was fused to copies of the DUX4 gene on either 4q35 or 10q26.3. Subsequent FISH analysis confirmed fused signals of CIC with either 4q35 or 10q26.3 region in six cases each. Tumors positive for CIC-DUX4 fusion occurred mainly in male young adult patients (median age: 29 years), with the extremities being the most frequent location. Microscopically, tumors displayed a primitive, round to oval cell morphology with prominent nucleoli, high mitotic count, and areas of necrosis. O13 expression was variable, being either diffuse or patchy and tumors mostly lacked other markers of differentiation. Although CIC-DUX4 resulting in a t(4;19) translocation has been previously described in primitive sarcomas, this is the first report implicating the related DUX4 on 10q26 in oncogenesis. These results suggest the possibility of a newly defined subgroup of primitive round cell sarcomas characterized by CIC rearrangements, distinct from Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.",Journal Article,2994.0,174.0,Primitive round cell sarcomas of childhood and young adults have been problematic to diagnose and classify Our goal was to investigate the pathologic and molecular characteristics of small blue round cell tumors SBRCT that remained unclassified after exhaustive immunohistochemistry and molecular screening to exclude known sarcoma-related translocations As rare examples of EWSR1-negative SBRCT have been shown to carry rearrangements for FUS and CIC genes we undertook a systematic screening for these two genes CIC rearrangements by FISH were detected in 15/22 68 while none showed FUS abnormalities RACE RT-PCR and/or long-range DNA PCR performed in two cases with frozen material showed that CIC was fused to copies of the DUX4 gene on either 4q35 or 10q26.3 Subsequent FISH analysis confirmed fused signals of CIC with either 4q35 or 10q26.3 region in six cases each Tumors positive for CIC-DUX4 fusion occurred mainly in male young adult patients median age 29 years with the extremities being the most frequent location Microscopically tumors displayed a primitive round to oval cell morphology with prominent nucleoli high mitotic count and areas of necrosis O13 expression was variable being either diffuse or patchy and tumors mostly lacked other markers of differentiation Although CIC-DUX4 resulting in a t 4 19 translocation has been previously described in primitive sarcomas this is the first report implicating the related DUX4 on 10q26 in oncogenesis These results suggest the possibility of a newly defined subgroup of primitive round cell sarcomas characterized by CIC rearrangements distinct from family of tumors,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[5594, 4436, 31, 1479, 1, 864, 2, 1169, 857, 47, 85, 6594, 6, 6073, 2, 4896, 114, 1326, 10, 6, 963, 3, 510, 2, 219, 374, 1, 302, 3352, 4436, 31, 57, 46879, 17, 958, 7096, 50, 14764, 888, 2, 219, 453, 6, 6262, 440, 10638, 139, 3262, 22, 622, 4416, 1, 6620, 199, 46879, 47, 85, 443, 6, 3542, 2072, 9, 10227, 2, 8553, 214, 21, 5418, 8, 1556, 453, 9, 46, 100, 214, 8553, 2072, 20, 1277, 11, 530, 4, 167, 350, 806, 369, 1292, 224, 10227, 1171, 1047, 240, 604, 2, 15, 319, 184, 261, 604, 173, 4, 100, 140, 5, 3015, 3692, 224, 17, 8553, 10, 6263, 6, 5127, 1, 3, 18043, 145, 23, 361, 29218, 15, 19620, 27, 706, 1277, 65, 557, 6263, 2312, 1, 8553, 5, 361, 29218, 15, 19620, 27, 1053, 4, 437, 140, 296, 57, 109, 9, 8553, 18043, 1212, 489, 2615, 4, 1045, 1169, 780, 7, 52, 89, 462, 60, 5, 3, 6387, 486, 3, 96, 908, 1147, 7187, 57, 2507, 8, 5594, 4436, 6, 18334, 31, 2567, 5, 3689, 13282, 64, 2346, 1276, 2, 1361, 1, 1523, 60775, 55, 10, 1347, 486, 361, 1388, 15, 17750, 2, 57, 2754, 5005, 127, 525, 1, 910, 242, 8553, 18043, 1113, 4, 8, 102, 39, 326, 2006, 71, 85, 373, 1027, 4, 5594, 1479, 26, 16, 3, 157, 414, 7912, 3, 139, 18043, 23, 19620, 4, 4503, 46, 99, 309, 3, 2526, 1, 8, 732, 395, 1363, 1, 5594, 4436, 31, 1479, 765, 20, 8553, 2072, 834, 29, 607, 1, 57]",1634.0,"['primitive', 'round', 'sarcoma', 'childhood', 'young', 'adult', 'problematic', 'diagnose', 'classify', 'goal', 'wa', 'investigate', 'pathologic', 'molecular', 'characteristic', 'small', 'blue', 'round', 'sbrct', 'remained', 'unclassified', 'exhaustive', 'molecular', 'screening', 'exclude', 'known', 'sarcoma', 'related', 'translocation', 'rare', 'example', 'ewsr', 'negative', 'sbrct', 'shown', 'carry', 'rearrangement', 'fus', 'cic', 'undertook', 'systematic', 'screening', 'cic', 'rearrangement', 'fish', 'detected', 'showed', 'fus', 'abnormality', 'race', 'rt', 'pcr', 'long', 'range', 'dna', 'pcr', 'performed', 'case', 'frozen', 'material', 'showed', 'cic', 'wa', 'fused', 'copy', 'dux', 'subsequent', 'fish', 'confirmed', 'fused', 'signal', 'cic', 'region', 'case', 'positive', 'cic', 'dux', 'fusion', 'occurred', 'mainly', 'male', 'young', 'adult', 'patient', 'median', 'age', 'year', 'extremity', 'frequent', 'location', 'microscopically', 'displayed', 'primitive', 'round', 'oval', 'morphology', 'prominent', 'nucleolus', 'high', 'mitotic', 'count', 'area', 'necrosis', 'expression', 'wa', 'variable', 'diffuse', 'patchy', 'lacked', 'marker', 'differentiation', 'cic', 'dux', 'resulting', 'translocation', 'ha', 'previously', 'described', 'primitive', 'sarcoma', 'report', 'implicating', 'related', 'dux', 'oncogenesis', 'suggest', 'possibility', 'newly', 'defined', 'subgroup', 'primitive', 'round', 'sarcoma', 'characterized', 'cic', 'rearrangement', 'distinct', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'family']",22072439,25,0.1152073732718894
Oncogene mutation profiling of pediatric solid tumors reveals significant subsets of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma with mutated genes in growth signaling pathways.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2011-12-05,"In contrast to the numerous broad screens for oncogene mutations in adult cancers, few such screens have been conducted in pediatric solid tumors. To identify novel mutations and potential therapeutic targets in pediatric cancers, we conducted a high-throughput Sequenom-based analysis in large sets of several major pediatric solid cancers, including neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). We designed a highly multiplexed Sequenom-based assay to interrogate 275 recurrent mutations across 29 genes. Genomic DNA was extracted from 192 neuroblastoma, 75 Ewing sarcoma, 89 RMS, and 24 DSRCT samples. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were identified in 13% of neuroblastoma samples, 4% of Ewing sarcoma samples, 21.1% of RMS samples, and no DSRCT samples. ALK mutations were present in 10.4% of neuroblastoma samples. The remainder of neuroblastoma mutations involved the BRAF, RAS, and MAP2K1 genes and were absent in samples harboring ALK mutations. Mutations were more common in embryonal RMS (ERMS) samples (28.3%) than alveolar RMS (3.5%). In addition to previously identified RAS and FGFR4 mutations, we report for the first time PIK3CA and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) mutations in 5% and 3.3% of ERMS, respectively. In ERMS, Ewing sarcoma, and neuroblastoma, we identified novel occurrences of several oncogene mutations recognized as drivers in other cancers.

Predictors of acute chemotherapy-associated toxicity in patients with Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-12-16,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignant tumor of bone and soft tissue of children and young adults. Patients with ES are treated with intensive chemotherapy regimens. We describe predictors of acute chemotherapy-associated toxicity in this population. In this retrospective cohort study, records of ES patients treated at two academic medical centers between 1980 and 2010 were reviewed. Grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic chemotherapy-associated toxicities during frontline therapy were recorded for each patient, along with potential clinical and demographic predictors of toxicity. Bivariate analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression. The cohort included 142 patients with ES and toxicity data. In bivariate analyses, age <12 years at diagnosis, Latino ethnicity, low family income, and treatment on a clinical trial were associated with higher incidence of toxicity (P < 0.01). Tumor size, site, stage, mode of local control, body mass index, overall chemotherapy exposure and dose-intensity were not associated with toxicity. In multivariate analysis, low income (odds ratio (OR) 4.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-13.1), clinical trial enrollment (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.2-10.9), pelvic tumor site (OR 3.88, 95% CI 1.17-12.88), and age <12 years (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-7.5) were independent predictors of toxicity.

Clinical features and outcomes in patients with Ewing sarcoma and regional lymph node involvement.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2011-12-19,"A minority of patients with Ewing sarcoma present with regional lymph node involvement. We investigated if patient characteristics and outcomes differ between patients with Ewing sarcoma with and without regional node involvement. Patients <40 years of age with Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) reported to the SEER database from 1973 to 2008 were evaluated based on the presence (n = 91) or absence (n = 1,361) of regional node involvement. Patient characteristics were analyzed using Fisher exact tests. Overall survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and evaluated using log-rank tests and Cox models. Patients with regional node involvement were more likely to have extraskeletal primary tumors (65.9% vs. 31.2%; P < 0.001) and axial tumors (71.1% vs. 59.6%; P = 0.03) compared to patients without regional node involvement. The incidence of regional node involvement was 12.4% for patients with extraskeletal primary tumors compared to 3.2% for patients with skeletal tumors. Five-year overall survival from diagnosis was inferior for patients with regional node involvement compared to those without regional node involvement (45.9% vs. 60.3%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, regional node involvement was predictive of inferior overall survival independent of age, metastatic status, tumor site, and soft tissue origin (hazard ratio 1.59; 95% CI 1.16-2.19).

Phase I/II trial and pharmacokinetic study of cixutumumab in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors and Ewing sarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-12-19,"A phase I/II study of cixutumumab (IMC-A12) in children with refractory solid tumors was conducted. This study was designed to assess the toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of cixutumumab in children to determine a recommended phase II dose and to assess antitumor activity in Ewing sarcoma (ES). Pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors were treated with cixutumumab as a 1-hour intravenous infusion once per week. Two dose levels-6 and 9 mg/kg-were evaluated using a standard three-plus-three cohort design. Patients with refractory ES were treated in an expanded phase II cohort at each dose level. Forty-seven eligible patients with a median age of 15 years (range, 4 to 28 years) were enrolled. Twelve patients were treated in the dose-finding phase. Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild and infrequent. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 4 thrombocytopenia at 6 mg/kg and grade 3 dehydration at 9 mg/kg. Mean trough concentration (± standard deviation) at 9 mg/kg was 106 ± 57 μg/mL, which exceeded the effective trough concentration of 60 μg/mL observed in xenograft models. Three patients with ES had confirmed partial responses: one of 10 at 6 mg/kg and two of 20 at 9 mg/kg. Serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels consistently increased after one dose of cixutumumab.

"Phase II study of sequential gemcitabine followed by docetaxel for recurrent Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, or unresectable or locally recurrent chondrosarcoma: results of Sarcoma Alliance for Research Through Collaboration Study 003.",The oncologist,Oncologist,2012-02-23,"Gemcitabine and docetaxel have a broad spectrum of clinical activity in patients with carcinoma. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research Through Collaboration conducted a phase II trial of gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel in children and adults with recurrent Ewing sarcoma (EWS), osteosarcoma (OS), or unresectable or recurrent chondrosarcoma. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Gemcitabine (675 mg/m2 i.v. over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8) was administered in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 hour on day 8) every 21 days. All patients received filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. A Bayesian formulation was used to determine the probability of achieving the target response rate for each subtype-0.35 for EWS and OS or 0.20 for chondrosarcoma. If the probability of achieving the target response rate was <0.05, the combination was considered inactive. Toxicity was graded according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Fifty-three eligible patients were enrolled in the three subtype groups-OS (n = 14), EWS (n = 14), and chondrosarcoma (n = 25). Toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, dyspnea, bronchospasm, edema, neuropathy, and liver function abnormalities. Dose modification for toxicity was required for eight patients during cycle 1 and 16 patients in subsequent cycles. Seven patients withdrew from therapy as a result of toxicity. No complete responses were observed. Partial responses were observed in OS (n = 1), EWS (n = 2), and chondrosarcoma (n = 2) patients. Gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel was associated with a probability of reaching the target 35% response rate of <5% in OS patients and 5.6% in EWS patients; the probability of reaching a 20% response rate in chondrosarcoma patients was 14%. The Bayesian formulation permitted estimation of the probability of achieving the target response rate for each subtype after each response evaluation. By allowing multiple looks at the data, this design stopped the trial after considering the probability of achieving the target response rate and accrual rate. Because this design did not specify a rule for declaring the treatment as ""active"", a direct comparison with a standard two-stage phase II design is not appropriate. The decision to close the EWS and chondrosarcoma subtype arms was based, in part, on slow accrual and was supported by the low probability of achieving the target response rate. The rate of enrollment, rather than the statistical design, had a significant effect on the trial duration.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",2889.0,63.0,Gemcitabine and docetaxel have a broad spectrum of

Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells.,Nature,Nature,2012-03-28,"Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines--which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers--with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.",Journal Article,2855.0,1259.0,Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients In some cases mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents Here to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines -- which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers -- with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation In aggregate we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents Unexpected relationships were revealed including the marked sensitivity of 's cells harbouring the EWS also known as EWSR1 -FLI1 gene translocation to poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[38, 253, 6, 1475, 235, 32, 629, 2016, 6, 8, 697, 1, 7, 4, 476, 140, 1185, 12, 214, 32, 1157, 582, 9, 253, 6, 238, 183, 467, 6, 6281, 217, 582, 1, 485, 2, 251, 6, 12, 1943, 21, 2261, 8, 993, 1, 392, 1128, 12, 31, 285, 92, 1231, 1802, 1, 3, 246, 267, 2, 336, 3653, 1, 171, 163, 5, 3431, 600, 669, 38, 2, 693, 940, 4, 7494, 21, 204, 17, 1185, 12, 214, 11, 41, 5, 763, 51, 6, 96, 694, 390, 12, 600, 3168, 1836, 8053, 4887, 11, 1230, 20, 402, 246, 112, 15, 55, 582, 2, 476, 746, 1185, 214, 11, 41, 5, 485, 6, 8, 2094, 184, 1, 189, 183, 3792, 2467, 11, 553, 141, 3, 2003, 485, 1, 292, 37, 10872, 3, 4528, 120, 440, 22, 6620, 8327, 145, 2006, 6, 2699, 3638, 3507, 1451, 2041, 222, 20, 5806, 234, 128, 6, 3, 583, 3082, 1, 12, 5085, 1556, 6971, 1080, 4, 12, 31, 285, 777, 8, 3757, 901, 1574, 2243, 6, 1597, 2696, 12, 189, 422]",1224.0,"['clinical', 'response', 'anticancer', 'therapy', 'restricted', 'subset', 'patient', 'case', 'potent', 'biomarkers', 'response', 'targeted', 'agent', 'uncover', 'new', 'biomarkers', 'sensitivity', 'resistance', 'therapeutic', 'screened', 'panel', 'line', 'represent', 'tissue', 'type', 'genetic', 'diversity', 'human', 'drug', 'clinical', 'preclinical', 'investigation', 'aggregate', 'associated', 'cellular', 'response', 'currently', 'available', 'drug', 'classic', 'oncogene', 'addiction', 'paradigm', 'modified', 'additional', 'tissue', 'specific', 'expression', 'biomarkers', 'frequently', 'associated', 'sensitivity', 'broad', 'range', 'therapeutic', 'agent', 'unexpected', 'relationship', 'revealed', 'including', 'marked', 'sensitivity', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'harbouring', 'ew', 'known', 'ewsr', 'fli', 'translocation', 'poly', 'adp', 'ribose', 'polymerase', 'parp', 'inhibitor', 'linking', 'drug', 'activity', 'functional', 'complexity', 'genome', 'systematic', 'pharmacogenomic', 'profiling', 'line', 'provides', 'powerful', 'biomarker', 'discovery', 'platform', 'guide', 'rational', 'therapeutic', 'strategy']",22460902,16,0.07373271889400922

Seven of 20 patients (35%) achieved stable disease (SD) for more than 5 months or complete/partial (CR/PR) responses. Tumor regression of more than 20% (23%, 23%, 27%, 100%, 100%) occurred in five of 17 (29%) patients with EWS, and they remained on study for 8 to 27 months. One of six patients with EWS who previously developed resistance to a different IGF-1R inhibitor antibody achieved a CR. Four of the seven best responders developed grade III mucositis, myelosuppression, or hyperglycemia, which were controlled while maintaining drug dose.

Common musculoskeletal tumors of childhood and adolescence.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2012-05-01,"Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma are the most common malignant musculoskeletal tumors in children and adolescents. Today, most patients can be cured. Numerous factors have contributed to improved outcome for these patients over the past several decades. These include multidisciplinary care involving oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, and radiologists and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease have resulted in studies using molecular targets in addition to standard chemotherapeutic agents, which hopefully will lead to better outcomes in the future. Moreover, new orthopedic techniques and devices as well as new technologies in radiation oncology hold promise for better local control of primary tumors and the potential for fewer late adverse effects. Despite this progress, patients must undergo lifelong follow-up for possible late effects of intense chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We review the diagnosis, prognosis, staging, multidisciplinary therapy, new directions in therapy, and long-term complications of treatment for these tumors. For this review, we searched MEDLINE using the terms rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, biology, and humans and limited the search to articles from 2000 to September 2011.

Ewing's sarcoma: overcoming the therapeutic plateau.,Discovery medicine,Discov Med,2012-06-01,"The hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a translocation--t(11;22)(q24;q12)--that most frequently results in the EWS/FLI1 aberrant chimeric gene. Because EWS afflicts young patients, it stands out among the diverse sarcoma subtypes. The frontline, standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens produce minimal benefit in patients with metastases at presentation or those with relapsed disease. While the outcomes of chemorefractory EWS patients are generally poor, recent developments have led to the promising use of targeted therapy. Specifically, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways has emerged as a targeted therapy in EWS, with select patients experiencing dramatic therapeutic responses. However, targeted therapies in general, and these responders in particular, are faced with the ultimate conundrum of eventual resistance. To optimize response, combining IGF1R and mTOR inhibitor-based regimens with chemotherapy in the upfront setting in newly diagnosed high-risk EWS may clarify the true benefit of IGF1R inhibitors in these patients. Another option is to explore novel targeted multikinase inhibitors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which have experienced a surge in supporting preclinical data. Drugs inhibiting the downstream targets of EWS/FLI1 are also in preclinical development. However, ultimately, the underlying biomarker correlates of resistance and response must be delineated along with ways to overcome them.

"Expression of ERG, an Ets family transcription factor, identifies ERG-rearranged Ewing sarcoma.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2012-07-06,"ERG gene encodes for an Ets family regulatory transcription factor and is involved in recurrent chromosomal translocations found in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias, prostate carcinomas and Ewing sarcomas. The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of an ERG antibody to detect EWSR1-ERG rearranged Ewing sarcomas. A formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarray and whole-tissue sections from 32 genetically characterized Ewing sarcomas were examined: 22 with EWSR1-FLI1, 8 with EWSR1-ERG and 2 with EWSR1-NFATC2. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a rabbit anti-ERG monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminus of the protein and a mouse anti-FLI1 monoclonal antibody against a FLI1 Ets domain (C-terminus) fusion protein. Immunoreactivity was graded for extent and intensity of positive tumor cell nuclei. ERG labeling was seen in 7/8 EWSR1-ERG cases (predominantly diffuse (5+), moderate to strong), while only 3/24 non-EWR1-ERG cases showed labeling (very weak). FLI1 labeling was observed in 29/31 cases regardless of fusion variant; 23 displayed diffuse (5+) strong/moderate labeling (5/7 EWSR1-ERG, 18/22 EWSR1-FLI1). Both EWSR1-NFATC2 cases had weak reactivity with FLI1 and weak or no reactivity for ERG. In conclusion, strong nuclear ERG immunoreactivity is specific for Ewing sarcomas with EWSR1-ERG rearrangement.

Clinical features and outcomes in patients with secondary Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2012-07-27,"Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is rarely diagnosed as a second malignancy. We sought to describe a cohort of patients with secondary EWS and investigate if patient characteristics and survival differ between patients with secondary and primary EWS. Patients with EWS or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database from 1973 to 2008 were evaluated based on primary or secondary tumor sequence. Overall survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and evaluated using the log-rank test. Competing risk analysis was used to describe risk of death due to malignancy rather than other causes. Fifty-eight cases of secondary EWS were reported, accounting for 2.1% of all EWS cases. The median latency from primary malignancy to secondary EWS was 64 months (range 1-282 months). 12.1% of patients with secondary EWS received radiation to the site of secondary tumor during therapy for their primary malignancy. Patients with secondary EWS were more likely to have axial tumors (77.4% vs. 62.5%; P = 0.03) and smaller tumors (75.0% vs. 48.2% <8 cm; P = 0.001). Five-year overall survival from diagnosis was inferior for patients with secondary compared to primary EWS (34.3% vs. 52.2%; P = 0.002). However, patients with secondary tumors were less likely than those with primary EWS to die from their malignancy [hazard ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.85].

An unusual cause of a lump in the parotid gland.,BMJ case reports,BMJ Case Rep,2012-12-05,"We present a case of a 50-year-old man with a lump in the left parotid gland. A 4 cm soft mobile lump was identified in the left parotid gland clinically. CT of the parotid glands and neck was arranged confirming a 4 cm mass, predominantly situated within the superficial lobe anterosuperiorly but extending deep to the expected plane of the facial nerve.

Adult Ewing sarcoma: survival and local control outcomes in 36 patients with metastatic disease.,American journal of clinical oncology,Am. J. Clin. Oncol.,2014-10-01,"To assess the clinical features and outcomes in adult patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma (ES). The records of 36 ES patients with metastatic disease ≥ 18 years seen from 1977 to 2007 at the Mayo Clinic were studied retrospectively. Factors relevant to prognosis, survival, and local control (LC) were analyzed. The 4-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 20% and 11%, respectively. Patients treated from 1993 to 2007 had significantly improved outcomes compared with those treated from 1977 to 1992: 4-year OS and EFS of 31% and 16%, respectively, versus 0% (P = 0.01). Primary tumor (P = 0.005 and 0.04) and metastatic sites (P = 0.05) were independent EFS prognostic factors. Four patients (11%) received surgery, 18 (50%) radiation therapy (RT), 4 (11%) surgery + radiation therapy (S+RT), and 10 (28%) received no LC. The 4-year EFS rates were 0% for surgery, 21% for RT, 0% for S + RT, and 0% for no LC (P = 0.0001). OS in patients who received vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosphamide and etoposide (VDC/IE) chemotherapy was improved (P = 0.04). Relapses were documented in 18 patients (excluding patients who received no LC). In total, 44% of patients had all of their metastatic site(s) treated. Patients who received treatment to all extrapulmonary metastases had significantly improved outcomes compared with those who did not receive treatment to all sites: 4-year OS and EFS of 33% and 11%, respectively, versus 0% (P = 0.04 and 0.02).

Modeling Ewing sarcoma tumors in vitro with 3D scaffolds.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.,2013-04-01,"The pronounced biological influence of the tumor microenvironment on cancer progression and metastasis has gained increased recognition over the past decade, yet most preclinical antineoplastic drug testing is still reliant on conventional 2D cell culture systems. Although monolayer cultures recapitulate some of the phenotypic traits observed clinically, they are limited in their ability to model the full range of microenvironmental cues, such as ones elicited by 3D cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. To address these shortcomings, we established an ex vivo 3D Ewing sarcoma model that closely mimics the morphology, growth kinetics, and protein expression profile of human tumors. We observed that Ewing sarcoma cells cultured in porous 3D electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds not only were more resistant to traditional cytotoxic drugs than were cells in 2D monolayer culture but also exhibited remarkable differences in the expression pattern of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.

The treatment outcome for adult patients with Ewing's sarcoma.,Current oncology reports,Curr Oncol Rep,2013-08-01,"Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children, but is extremely rare in adults. The outcome of patients with localized disease has improved over the past decades due to better combination chemotherapies, and better methods of local control. Unfortunately, patients with metastatic disease have a very poor outcome with current antineoplastic therapies.

Role of epigenetic modulation for the treatment of sarcoma.,Current treatment options in oncology,Curr Treat Options Oncol,2013-09-01,"Sarcoma is a disease that includes many different subtypes that can present with a wide range of differing clinical findings, prognosis, and treatment options. For certain subsets (e.g., Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]), extensive clinical trials have delineated effective treatment regimens often involving combination therapy, including surgery, radiation, systemic chemotherapy, and small molecular inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (as in the case of GIST). For nearly all patients with sarcoma who have relapsed or developed metastasis, the therapeutic benefit of chemotherapy has reached a plateau and as such new treatment approaches are needed to move this field forward. We recommend that all patients have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials where available. Recently, in our clinic we have started to increase our use of molecular testing and DNA sequencing studies to help identify potential treatment options for patients. One area of evolving basic and clinical research in sarcomas is the field of epigenetic therapeutics.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose-painting for pediatric sarcomas with pulmonary metastases.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-06-13,"We examined patterns of failure in pediatric patients with thoracic sarcoma and pulmonary metastases treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose-painting (DP-IMRT). Eleven pediatric patients, five with Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) and six with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), with primary thoracic tumors and pulmonary metastases underwent DP-IMRT with chemotherapy for definitive treatment. Eight patients also underwent surgery. Median time to RT was 21 (15-31) weeks. Nine patients received 45-50.4-Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions to the primary tumor (n = 3) or post-operative tumor bed (n = 6). Two patients ≤4 years received 12 Gy intraoperative radiation therapy and 30.6-36 Gy IMRT postoperatively to the tumor bed. All patients received 14-16.8 Gy in 0.54-0.88 Gy fractions to the whole lungs (n = 6) or hemithorax (n = 5) using dose-painting technique. A representative case was re-planned with IMRT plus standard AP/PA whole lung irradiation (WLI) for dosimetric comparison. With 27-month median follow-up, 3-year pulmonary relapse-free survival in all patients was 61%: 80% for RMS and 40% for ESFT. Five patients (4 ESFT and 1 RMS) experienced pulmonary relapse at median 16 (9-41) months. There were no local failures. Our representative case demonstrated more homogeneous target volume coverage of the whole lungs and decreased mean dose to esophagus (15%), heart (31%), spinal cord (15%), and liver (19%) with DP-IMRT.

Germline PTPRD mutations in Ewing sarcoma: biologic and clinical implications.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2013-06-01,"Ewing sarcoma occurs in children, adolescents and young adults. High STAT3 levels have been reported in approximately 50% of patients with Ewing sarcoma, and may be important in tumorigenesis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits STAT3 activation. To date, while somatic mutations in PTPRD have been reported in diverse tumors, germline mutations of PTPRD have not been investigated in Ewing sarcoma or other cancers. We identified a novel germline mutation in the PTPRD gene in three of eight patients (37.5%) with metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Although the functional impact in two of the patients is unclear, in one of them the aberration was annotated as a W775stop germline mutation, and would be expected to lead to gene truncation and, hence, loss of the STAT3 dephosphorylation function of PTPRD. Since STAT3 is phosphorylated after being recruited to the insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), suppression of IGF-1R could attenuate the enhanced STAT3 activation expected in the presence of PTPRD mutations. Of interest, two of three patients with germline PTPRD mutations achieved durable complete responses following treatment with IGF-1R monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Our pilot data suggest that PTPRD germline mutations may play a role in the development of Ewing sarcoma, a disease of young people, and their presence may have implications for therapy.

The hallmark of this disease is a EWS-WT1 translocation resulting from apposition of the Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) gene with the Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene. We performed morphoproteomic profiling of DSRCT (EWS-WT1), Ewing's sarcoma (EWS-FLI1) and Wilms' tumor (WT1) to better understand the signaling pathways for selecting future targeted therapies. This pilot study assessed patients with DSRCT, Wilms' tumor and Ewing's sarcoma. Morphoproteomics and immunohistochemical probes were applied to detect: p-mTOR (Ser2448); p-Akt (Ser473); p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204); p-STAT3 (Tyr 705); and cell cycle-related analytes along with their negative controls. In DSRCT the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is constitutively activated by p-Akt (Ser 473) expression in the nuclear compartment of the tumor cells and p-mTOR phosphorylated on Ser 2448, suggesting mTORC2 (rictor+mTOR) as the dominant form. Ewing's sarcoma had upregulated p-Akt and p-mTOR, predominantly mTORC2. In Wilm's tumor, the mTOR pathway is also activated with most tumor cells moderately expressing p-mTOR (Ser 2448) in plasmalemmal and cytoplasmic compartments. This coincides with the constitutive activation of one of the downstream effectors of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, namely p-p70S6K (Thr 389). There was constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) expression in the Wilms tumor and metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, but not in the DSRCT. MORPHOPROTEOMIC TUMOR ANALYSES REVEALED CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION OF THE MTOR PATHWAY AS EVIDENCED BY: (a) expression of phosphorylated (p)-mTOR, p-p70S6K; (b) mTORC 2 in EWS and DSRCT; (c) ERK signaling was seen in the advanced setting indicating these as resistance pathways to IGF1R related therapies.

Combining PARP-1 inhibition and radiation in Ewing sarcoma results in lethal DNA damage.,Molecular cancer therapeutics,Mol. Cancer Ther.,2013-08-21,"Ewing sarcomas (ES) harbor a chromosomal translocation that fuses the EWS gene to an ETS transcription factor, most commonly Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1). The EWS-FLI1 fusion protein acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of PARP-1, which is involved in repair of DNA damage. Here, we examine the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on Ewing sarcomas. In proliferation assays, the Ewing sarcoma cell lines RD-ES and SK-N-MC were much more sensitive than non-Ewing sarcoma cell lines to the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib (Ola; IC50 0.5-1 μmol/L vs. >5 μmol/L) and to radiation (IC50 2-4 Gy vs. >6 Gy). PARP-1 inhibition with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or Ola sensitized Ewing sarcoma cells, but not non-Ewing sarcoma cells, to radiation therapy in both proliferation and colony formation assays. Using the Comet assay, radiation of Ewing sarcoma cells with Ola, compared to without Ola, resulted in more DNA damage at 1 hour (mean tail moment 36-54 vs. 26-28) and sustained DNA damage at 24 hours (24-29 vs. 6-8). This DNA damage led to a 2.9- to 4.0-fold increase in apoptosis and a 1.6- to 2.4-fold increase in cell death. The effect of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on Ewing sarcoma cells was lost when EWS-FLI1 was silenced by shRNA. A small dose of radiation therapy (4 Gy), when combined with PARP-1 inhibition, stopped the growth of SK-N-MC flank tumors xenografts. In conclusion, PARP-1 inhibition in Ewing sarcomas amplifies the level and duration of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy, leading to synergistic increases in apoptosis and cell death in a EWS-FLI1-dependent manner.",Journal Article,2344.0,34.0,sarcomas ES harbor a chromosomal translocation that fuses the EWS gene to an ETS transcription factor most commonly Friend integration 1 FLI1 The EWS-FLI1 fusion protein acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of PARP-1 which is involved in repair of DNA damage Here we examine the effects of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on sarcomas In proliferation assays the cell lines RD-ES and SK-N-MC were much more sensitive than non-Ewing cell lines to the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib Ola IC50 0.5-1 μmol/L vs. 5 μmol/L and to radiation IC50 2-4 Gy vs. 6 Gy PARP-1 inhibition with short hairpin RNA shRNA or Ola sensitized cells but not non-Ewing cells to radiation therapy in both proliferation and colony formation assays Using the Comet assay radiation of cells with Ola compared to without Ola resulted in more DNA damage at 1 hour mean tail moment 36-54 vs. 26-28 and sustained DNA damage at 24 hours 24-29 vs. 6-8 This DNA damage led to a 2.9- to 4.0-fold increase in apoptosis and a 1.6- to 2.4-fold increase in cell death The effect of PARP-1 inhibition and radiation therapy on cells was lost when EWS-FLI1 was silenced by shRNA A small dose of radiation therapy 4 Gy when combined with PARP-1 inhibition stopped the growth of SK-N-MC flank tumors xenografts In conclusion PARP-1 inhibition in sarcomas amplifies the level and duration of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy leading to synergistic increases in apoptosis and cell death in a EWS-FLI1-dependent manner,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[1479, 3011, 2760, 8, 1860, 2006, 17, 19435, 3, 4528, 145, 6, 35, 4802, 866, 161, 96, 841, 18205, 2676, 14, 8327, 3, 4528, 8327, 1212, 178, 4459, 4, 8, 109, 3983, 4432, 6, 3040, 3, 55, 1, 2041, 14, 92, 16, 646, 4, 972, 1, 261, 1350, 467, 21, 1004, 3, 176, 1, 2041, 14, 297, 2, 121, 36, 23, 1479, 4, 457, 1013, 3, 31, 285, 3089, 3011, 2, 9845, 78, 4779, 11, 1802, 80, 745, 76, 220, 20442, 31, 285, 6, 3, 2041, 14, 230, 4024, 27304, 5211, 13, 33, 14, 7674, 805, 105, 33, 7674, 805, 2, 6, 121, 5211, 18, 39, 381, 105, 49, 381, 2041, 14, 297, 5, 978, 5957, 893, 3976, 15, 27304, 4242, 37, 84, 44, 220, 20442, 37, 6, 121, 36, 4, 110, 457, 2, 1975, 1264, 1013, 75, 3, 11175, 719, 121, 1, 37, 5, 27304, 72, 6, 187, 27304, 627, 4, 80, 261, 1350, 28, 14, 2583, 313, 5809, 12854, 511, 667, 105, 432, 339, 2, 2275, 261, 1350, 28, 259, 1459, 259, 462, 105, 49, 66, 26, 261, 1350, 836, 6, 8, 18, 83, 6, 39, 13, 1116, 344, 4, 351, 2, 8, 14, 49, 6, 18, 39, 1116, 344, 4, 31, 273, 3, 254, 1, 2041, 14, 297, 2, 121, 36, 23, 37, 10, 3009, 198, 4528, 8327, 10, 5442, 20, 3976, 8, 302, 61, 1, 121, 36, 39, 381, 198, 397, 5, 2041, 14, 297, 4403, 3, 129, 1, 9845, 78, 4779, 5564, 57, 1348, 4, 1221, 2041, 14, 297, 4, 1479, 19051, 3, 301, 2, 654, 1, 261, 1350, 1546, 20, 121, 36, 1049, 6, 1806, 1106, 4, 351, 2, 31, 273, 4, 8, 4528, 8327, 470, 1708]",1499.0,"['ewing', 'sarcoma', 'harbor', 'chromosomal', 'translocation', 'fuse', 'ew', 'ets', 'transcription', 'factor', 'commonly', 'friend', 'leukemia', 'integration', 'fli', 'ew', 'fli', 'fusion', 'act', 'positive', 'feedback', 'loop', 'maintain', 'expression', 'parp', 'involved', 'repair', 'dna', 'damage', 'examine', 'effect', 'parp', 'inhibition', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'proliferation', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'rd', 'sk', 'mc', 'sensitive', 'non', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'line', 'parp', 'inhibitor', 'olaparib', 'ola', 'ic', 'μmol', 'μmol', 'radiation', 'ic', 'gy', 'gy', 'parp', 'inhibition', 'short', 'hairpin', 'rna', 'shrna', 'ola', 'sensitized', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'non', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'proliferation', 'colony', 'formation', 'comet', 'radiation', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'ola', 'compared', 'ola', 'resulted', 'dna', 'damage', 'hour', 'mean', 'tail', 'moment', 'sustained', 'dna', 'damage', 'hour', 'dna', 'damage', 'led', 'fold', 'increase', 'apoptosis', 'fold', 'increase', 'death', 'effect', 'parp', 'inhibition', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'wa', 'lost', 'ew', 'fli', 'wa', 'silenced', 'shrna', 'small', 'dose', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'gy', 'combined', 'parp', 'inhibition', 'stopped', 'growth', 'sk', 'mc', 'flank', 'xenograft', 'parp', 'inhibition', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'amplifies', 'level', 'duration', 'dna', 'damage', 'caused', 'radiation', 'therapy', 'leading', 'synergistic', 'increase', 'apoptosis', 'death', 'ew', 'fli', 'dependent', 'manner']",23966622,7,0.03225806451612903
Comparison of Latino and non-Latino patients with Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2013-08-23,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignancy of bone and soft tissue in children and adults. Previous registry-based studies indicate that Latino patients with ES have inferior outcomes compared to non-Latino patients, though an etiology for this difference could not be identified. To explore possible differences that might underlie this disparity, we conducted a retrospective study to compare clinical characteristics, tumor features, healthcare access, and treatment outcomes between Latino and non-Latino patients with ES. Primary data for 218 ES patients treated at two academic medical centers between 1980 and 2010 were collected. Categorical data were compared using Fisher exact tests; Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for continuous variables. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank testing. Latino patients were diagnosed at a younger age (P = 0.014). All other clinical and histological data were similar between groups, including radiologic and histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Latino patients had lower socioeconomic status (P = 0.001), were less likely to have insurance (P = 0.001), and were more likely to present to the emergency room at onset of symptoms (P = 0.031) rather than to primary care physicians.

Targeted radiosensitization of ETS fusion-positive prostate cancer through PARP1 inhibition.,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",Neoplasia,2013-10-01,"ETS gene fusions, which result in overexpression of an ETS transcription factor, are considered driving mutations in approximately half of all prostate cancers. Dysregulation of ETS transcription factors is also known to exist in Ewing's sarcoma, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We previously discovered that ERG, the predominant ETS family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in human prostate cancer specimens. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ERG-PARP1 interaction may confer radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this radio-resistance could be reversed through PARP1 inhibition. Using lentiviral approaches, we established isogenic models of ERG overexpression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, ERG overexpression increased clonogenic survival following radiation by 1.25 (±0.07) fold (mean ± SEM) and also resulted in increased PARP1 activity. PARP1 inhibition with olaparib preferentially radiosensitized ERG-positive cells by a factor of 1.52 (±0.03) relative to ERG-negative cells (P < .05). Neutral and alkaline COMET assays and immunofluorescence microscopy assessing γ-H2AX foci showed increased short- and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was preferentially reversed by PARP1 inhibition. These findings were verified in an in vivo xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that ERG overexpression confers radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through inhibition of PARP1. These results motivate the use of PARP1 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with localized ETS fusion-positive cancers.

Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.,FEBS letters,FEBS Lett.,2013-12-01,"Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma in children and adolescents, as well as liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas in adults. Since GD2 expression in normal tissues is restricted to the brain, which is inaccessible to circulating antibodies, and in selected peripheral nerves and melanocytes, it was deemed a suitable target for systemic tumor immunotherapy. Anti-GD2 antibodies have been actively tested in clinical trials for neuroblastoma for over the past two decades, with proven safety and efficacy. The main limitations have been acute pain toxicity associated with GD2 expression on peripheral nerve fibers and the inability of antibodies to treat bulky tumor. Several strategies have been developed to reduce pain toxicity, including bypassing complement activation, using blocking antibodies, or targeting of O-acetyl-GD2 derivative that is not expressed on peripheral nerves. To enhance anti-tumor efficacy, anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies and fragments have been engineered into immunocytokines, immunotoxins, antibody drug conjugates, radiolabeled antibodies, targeted nanoparticles, T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptors.

"Pre-clinical efficacy of PU-H71, a novel HSP90 inhibitor, alone and in combination with bortezomib in Ewing sarcoma.",Molecular oncology,Mol Oncol,2013-12-15,"Ewing sarcoma is characterized by multiple deregulated pathways that mediate cell survival and proliferation. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a critical component of the multi-chaperone complexes that regulate the disposition and activity of a large number of proteins involved in cell-signaling systems. We tested the efficacy of PU-H71, a novel HSP90 inhibitor in Ewing sarcoma cell lines, primary samples, benign mesenchymal stromal cells and hematopoietic stem cells. We performed cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assay, immunoblot analysis and reverse phase protein array in Ewing cell lines and in vivo experiments in NSG and nude mice using the A673 cell line. We noted a significant therapeutic window in the activity of PU-H71 against Ewing cell lines and benign cells. PU-H71 treatment resulted in G2/M phase arrest. Exposure to PU-H71 resulted in depletion of critical proteins including AKT, pERK, RAF-1, c-MYC, c-KIT, IGF1R, hTERT and EWS-FLI1 in Ewing cell lines. Our results indicated that Ewing sarcoma tumor growth and the metastatic burden were significantly reduced in the mice injected with PU-H71 compared to the control mice. We also investigated the effects of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, alone and in combination with PU-H71 in Ewing sarcoma. Combination index (CI)-Fa plots and normalized isobolograms indicated synergism between PU-H71 and bortezomib.

Comparative evaluation of strategies for quantifying signaling pathway proteins in Ewing sarcoma.,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol.,2014-09-01,"Targeted therapies are increasingly being evaluated for patients with Ewing sarcoma (EWS). Optimal strategies for quantifying key signaling proteins in EWS remain unclear. We sought to quantify tumor expression of signaling pathway proteins in EWS using 3 methodologies. A total of 46 blocks of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were obtained from 40 patients with EWS. Tumor was evaluated for the expression of proteins in the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R), epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), and mTOR pathways using standard immunohistochemical analysis (IHC), automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) immunohistochemical analysis, and mass spectrometry quantification. The mean age at diagnosis was 14 years (range, 1 to 49 y). About 67.5% were male and 57.5% had localized disease. Samples displayed a wide range of expression by AQUA: mean (range) IGF-1R=10,702 (393 to 14,424); EGFR=2750 (672 to 9798); and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)=2250 (251 to 6557). Mean IGF-1R expression by AQUA did not differ between standard IHC expression categories (low IHC=11,255; medium IHC=11,070; high IHC=11,023; P=0.98). Mean PTEN expression by AQUA was higher in the medium and high IHC categories (low IHC=1229; medium IHC=2715; high IHC=2940; P=0.064). Only 2 samples expressed EGFR by standard IHC. Mass spectrometry trended toward correlation with standard IHC but did not yield interpretable results in the majority of samples. This study demonstrates that the relative quantification of signaling protein expression in EWS is dependent on the methodology used. Optimization and validation of these tools are necessary before clinical application for risk stratification of patients or measurement of biomarker expression.

Is methylene diphosphonate bone scan necessary for initial staging of Ewing sarcoma if 18F-FDG PET/CT is performed?,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2014-04-01,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans are necessary during initial staging in patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) in whom (18)F-FDG PET/CT is performed. A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent FDG PET/CT and MDP bone scan before treatment of newly diagnosed ES from January 2004 to November 2012. Studies were reviewed to document suspected primary and metastatic malignancy. Pathology and imaging follow-up were used to determine the presence or absence of disease at suspected sites. Sixty patients were identified in whom FDG PET/CT and MDP bone scans were performed before treatment of newly diagnosed ES. Forty-four primary malignancies had a lytic CT appearance, three were sclerotic, and 13 involved only soft tissue. In 11 of 12 patients with osseous metastases, these were detected on PET/CT, with the one false-negative occurring in a sclerotic primary tumor; in nine of 12 patients with osseous metastases, these were detected on MDP bone scan, with the three false-negatives occurring in patients with lytic primary tumors. Only one of 13 patients with a soft-tissue primary malignancy had bone metastases on both bone scan and PET/CT. PET/CT also showed that eight patients had lung metastases and three patients had lymph node metastases, which were not evident on MDP bone scan. When ES is lytic, MDP bone scan does not add to staging performed by FDG PET/CT; thus, MDP bone scanning may be omitted. However, when ES is sclerotic, MDP bone scan may detect osseous metastases not detected by FDG PET/CT.",Journal Article,2121.0,14.0,The purpose of this study was to determine whether methylene diphosphonate MDP scans are necessary during initial staging in patients with ES in whom 18 F-FDG PET/CT is performed A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent FDG PET/CT and MDP scan before treatment of newly diagnosed ES from January 2004 to November 2012 Studies were reviewed to document suspected primary and metastatic malignancy Pathology and imaging follow-up were used to determine the presence or absence of disease at suspected sites Sixty patients were identified in whom FDG PET/CT and MDP scans were performed before treatment of newly diagnosed ES Forty-four primary malignancies had a lytic CT appearance three were sclerotic and 13 involved only soft tissue In 11 of 12 patients with osseous metastases these were detected on PET/CT with the one false-negative occurring in a sclerotic primary tumor in nine of 12 patients with osseous metastases these were detected on MDP scan with the three false-negatives occurring in patients with lytic primary tumors Only one of 13 patients with a soft-tissue primary malignancy had metastases on both scan and PET/CT PET/CT also showed that eight patients had metastases and three patients had lymph node metastases which were not evident on MDP scan When ES is lytic MDP scan does not add to staging performed by FDG PET/CT thus MDP scanning may be omitted However when ES is sclerotic MDP scan may detect osseous metastases not detected by FDG PET/CT,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 317, 10256, 24415, 15781, 1441, 32, 1493, 190, 388, 632, 4, 7, 5, 3011, 4, 953, 203, 1068, 1285, 495, 425, 16, 173, 8, 459, 206, 10, 173, 1, 7, 54, 208, 1285, 495, 425, 2, 15781, 1657, 348, 24, 1, 732, 265, 3011, 29, 1024, 1131, 6, 2868, 1195, 94, 11, 446, 6, 4753, 2768, 86, 2, 113, 710, 1117, 2, 270, 166, 126, 11, 95, 6, 223, 3, 463, 15, 1127, 1, 34, 28, 2768, 633, 1746, 7, 11, 108, 4, 953, 1285, 495, 425, 2, 15781, 1441, 11, 173, 348, 24, 1, 732, 265, 3011, 1213, 294, 86, 441, 42, 8, 6148, 425, 3592, 169, 11, 11969, 2, 233, 646, 158, 1214, 246, 4, 175, 1, 133, 7, 5, 5230, 196, 46, 11, 530, 23, 495, 425, 5, 3, 104, 2133, 199, 1821, 4, 8, 11969, 86, 30, 4, 762, 1, 133, 7, 5, 5230, 196, 46, 11, 530, 23, 15781, 1657, 5, 3, 169, 2133, 13508, 1821, 4, 7, 5, 6148, 86, 57, 158, 104, 1, 233, 7, 5, 8, 1214, 246, 86, 710, 42, 196, 23, 110, 1657, 2, 495, 425, 495, 425, 120, 224, 17, 659, 7, 42, 196, 2, 169, 7, 42, 263, 289, 196, 92, 11, 44, 2853, 23, 15781, 1657, 198, 3011, 16, 6148, 15781, 1657, 1097, 44, 4178, 6, 632, 173, 20, 1285, 495, 425, 631, 15781, 3702, 68, 40, 7138, 137, 198, 3011, 16, 11969, 15781, 1657, 68, 1426, 5230, 196, 44, 530, 20, 1285, 495, 425]",1493.0,"['purpose', 'wa', 'determine', 'methylene', 'diphosphonate', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'necessary', 'initial', 'staging', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'fdg', 'pet', 'ct', 'performed', 'retrospective', 'review', 'wa', 'performed', 'patient', 'underwent', 'fdg', 'pet', 'ct', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'treatment', 'newly', 'diagnosed', 'january', 'november', 'reviewed', 'document', 'suspected', 'primary', 'metastatic', 'malignancy', 'pathology', 'imaging', 'follow', 'determine', 'presence', 'absence', 'disease', 'suspected', 'site', 'patient', 'identified', 'fdg', 'pet', 'ct', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'performed', 'treatment', 'newly', 'diagnosed', 'primary', 'malignancy', 'lytic', 'ct', 'appearance', 'sclerotic', 'involved', 'soft', 'tissue', 'patient', 'osseous', 'metastasis', 'detected', 'pet', 'ct', 'false', 'negative', 'occurring', 'sclerotic', 'primary', 'patient', 'osseous', 'metastasis', 'detected', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'false', 'negative', 'occurring', 'patient', 'lytic', 'primary', 'patient', 'soft', 'tissue', 'primary', 'malignancy', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'bone', 'scan', 'pet', 'ct', 'pet', 'ct', 'showed', 'patient', 'lung', 'metastasis', 'patient', 'lymph', 'node', 'metastasis', 'evident', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'lytic', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'doe', 'add', 'staging', 'performed', 'fdg', 'pet', 'ct', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scanning', 'omitted', 'sclerotic', 'mdp', 'bone', 'scan', 'detect', 'osseous', 'metastasis', 'detected', 'fdg', 'pet', 'ct']",24660717,136,0.6267281105990783
Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma with non-EWSR1-NR4A3 variant fusions correlate with rhabdoid phenotype and high-grade morphology.,Human pathology,Hum. Pathol.,2014-01-28,"Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas (EMC) are rare soft tissue sarcomas with distinctive histology and uncertain histogenesis, characterized by Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3 (EWSR1-NR4A3) fusion in 75% of the cases. A smaller proportion of cases show NR4A3 fused to other gene partners including TATA binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15), transcription factor 12 (TCF12), and TRK-fused gene (TFG). The impact of various gene fusions on morphology and outcome has not been previously evaluated. We investigated 26 consecutive EMCs and correlated the genetic findings with morphology and clinical outcome. There were 5 females and 21 males (median age, 49.5 years). Mean size of the tumors was 11 cm. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed EWSR1-NR4A3 gene fusion in 16 cases (62%), TAF15-NR4A3 gene fusion in 7 cases (27%), and TCF12-NR4A3 gene fusion in 1 case (4%). Two cases showed only NR4A3 gene rearrangements. Morphologically, most EWSR1-rearranged tumors (10/16) showed low cellularity, minimal cytologic atypia, and low mitotic counts. In contrast, 80% of EMCs with variant (non-EWSR1) NR4A3 gene fusions (TAF15, TCF12) had high-grade morphology with increased cellularity, proliferation, and cytologic atypia, showing a plasmacytoid/rhabdoid morphology in half the cases. Follow-up showed that only 1 of 16 patients with EWSR1-rearranged tumors died of disease, in contrast to 3 (43%) of 7 TAF15-rearranged tumors. In conclusion, EMCs with variant NR4A3 gene fusions show a higher incidence of rhabdoid phenotype, high-grade morphology, and a more aggressive outcome compared with the EWSR1-NR4A3 positive tumors. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization assay for NR4A3, along with EWSR1, may be an additional ancillary test to confirm diagnosis of EMCs.

Favorable outcomes after whole abdominopelvic radiation therapy for pediatric and young adult sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-05-04,"Current Children's Oncology Group (COG) guidelines recommend 24 Gy whole abdominopelvic radiation therapy (WAP-RT) for pediatric patients with sarcoma with peritoneal dissemination and/or malignant ascites.

The objective of this study was to evaluate feasibility, outcomes, and toxicity of WAP-RT in children with sarcoma and peritoneal dissemination. Detailed records of all 10 pediatric patients with sarcoma (excluding DSRCT) treated with WAP-RT from 2001 to 2013 were reviewed. Median age was 9.9 years (range, 1.7-33.8). Seven patients had rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 embryonal undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver, and 1 Ewing sarcoma. Patients received a median dose of 24 Gy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the whole abdomen and pelvis. Two patients did not complete treatment, one due to transfusion-resistant pancytopenia and one due to moderate acute gastrointestinal toxicity. At a median follow-up of 4.0 years, both relapse-free survival and overall survival were 100%. Acute hematologic toxicities were common, with 40% of patients developing a grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Most acute gastrointestinal toxicities were grade 1 and managed appropriately with anti-diarrheals and anti-emetics. Late effects varied, and half of patients are without long-term sequelae. All patients remain free of disease, both locally and distantly. Although WAP-RT was associated with acute and late toxicity, treatment was feasible with supportive care.

Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the dura in a 51-year-old woman following intensive treatment for breast cancer.,The American journal of case reports,Am J Case Rep,2014-07-10,"Female, 51. Ewing sarcoma. Visual disturbances. -. -. Oncology. Rare disease. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing sarcoma (PNET/EWS) is a round blue cell sarcoma that shows varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation. PNET/EWS as a primary intracranial tumor is extremely uncommon. We report a unique case of peripheral PNET presenting as an intracranial mass in an adult following chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a solid tumor. A 51-year-old woman with previously treated left breast cancer was evaluated for a newly developed brain mass. She underwent craniotomy with resection. Surgical pathology was consistent with a peripheral PNET/EWS with Ewing sarcoma gene translocation. She was treated appropriately with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (later dactinomycin) alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide.

Prognostic significance of treatment-induced pathologic necrosis in extremity and truncal soft tissue sarcoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-07-31,"Histologic response to chemotherapy has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. However, in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), the prognostic impact of histologic response to chemotherapy is less clear. In the current study, the authors sought to determine the prognostic significance of treatment-induced pathologic necrosis in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for STS. Between 1989 and 2011, a total of 113 patients with grade 2 or 3 (graded according to the National Cancer Institute grading system using 3 tiers) extremity or truncal STS were identified who received neoadjuvant interdigitated chemoradiotherapy according to protocol followed by surgery. The extent of tumor necrosis in the resected specimens was quantified and correlated with outcome. The median tumor necrosis rate was 90%, and 103 patients (91%) received all 3 cycles of planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The likelihood of achieving ≥95% necrosis was not related to the number of preoperative cycles of chemotherapy received but was found to be related to tumor histology (62% for malignant fibrous histiocytoma vs 0% for synovial sarcoma [P<.001]; 56% for myxoid liposarcoma vs 0% for synovial sarcoma [P = .002]). At a median follow-up of 6 years, there were no statistically significant differences noted in the 5-year local control, disease-specific survival, and overall survival rates for patients with ≥95% necrosis (50 patients; 44%) and <95% necrosis (63 patients; 56%), even when stratifying by histology.

Twenty eight patients with ES or DSRCT had tumor tissue available that could be analyzed by one of the following methods: 1) Next-generation exome sequencing platform; 2) Multiplex PCR/Mass Spectroscopy; 3) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single- gene mutation screening; 4) Sanger sequencing; 5) Morphoproteomics.

One patient with both PTPRD and GRB10 mutations and one with a GRB10 mutation achieved a complete remission (CR) on an Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor based treatment. One patient, who achieved a partial remission (PR) with IGF1R inhibitor treatment, but later developed resistance, demonstrated a KRAS mutation in the post-treatment resistant tumor, but not in the pre-treatment tumor suggesting that the RAF/RAS/MEK pathway was activated with progression.

Utility of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in initial staging of Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-08-30,"The current standard of care for initial staging of pediatric Ewing sarcoma (EWS) patients is to obtain a bilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (BMAB). The incidence of bone marrow (BM) disease in patients deemed non-metastatic by conventional and metabolic imaging and the concordance of BM positivity with other clinical characteristics are not well established. This study is a multi-institutional retrospective review of newly diagnosed EWS patients less than 40 years of age with initial staging that included imaging and BMAB. A total of 116 patients were eligible with 85 patients considered non-metastatic and 31 considered metastatic by imaging. None of the 85 patients with non-metastatic disease were BMAB positive (0%; 95% CI: 0-4.2%); 13 of the 31 patients with metastases were BMAB positive (41.9%; 95% CI: 24.5-60.9%). Primary tumor size was significantly higher in patients with metastases (P = 0.017). Bone metastasis by imaging had high correlation with BMAB positivity (P = 0.0002).

Thirteen patients were identified (median age, 33 y; male:female 11:2). Common presenting symptoms were back pain, flank pain, and hematuria. Six patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Initial diagnostic biopsy was performed in 6 patients. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity for CD99 (mic2) and cytogenetic analysis demonstrated evidence of EWSR1 fusion gene in 8 cases. Nine patients underwent nephrectomy. Frequently used chemotherapy regimens consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide. Median overall survival was 17.2 months. Three patients were alive at the time of analysis, at 2, 7, and 11 years from diagnosis (the latter without evidence of disease). Renal ESFT carry a guarded prognosis with limited response to therapy and short median overall survival.

Genomic landscape of Ewing sarcoma defines an aggressive subtype with co-association of STAG2 and TP53 mutations.,Cancer discovery,Cancer Discov,2014-09-15,"Ewing sarcoma is a primary bone tumor initiated by EWSR1-ETS gene fusions. To identify secondary genetic lesions that contribute to tumor progression, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 112 Ewing sarcoma samples and matched germline DNA. Overall, Ewing sarcoma tumors had relatively few single-nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants, and copy-number alterations. Apart from whole chromosome arm copy-number changes, the most common somatic mutations were detected in STAG2 (17%), CDKN2A (12%), TP53 (7%), EZH2, BCOR, and ZMYM3 (2.7% each). Strikingly, STAG2 mutations and CDKN2A deletions were mutually exclusive, as confirmed in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. In an expanded cohort of 299 patients with clinical data, we discovered that STAG2 and TP53 mutations are often concurrent and are associated with poor outcome. Finally, we detected subclonal STAG2 mutations in diagnostic tumors and expansion of STAG2-immunonegative cells in relapsed tumors as compared with matched diagnostic samples. Whole-genome sequencing reveals that the somatic mutation rate in Ewing sarcoma is low. Tumors that harbor STAG2 and TP53 mutations have a particularly dismal prognosis with current treatments and require alternative therapies.

Comparative evaluation of local control strategies in localized Ewing sarcoma of bone: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Cancer,Cancer,2014-09-23,"Patients with Ewing sarcoma require local primary tumor control with surgery, radiation, or both. The optimal choice of local control for overall and local disease control remains unclear. Patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone who were treated on 3 consecutive protocols with standard-dose, 5-drug chemotherapy every 3 weeks were included (n=465). Propensity scores were used to control for differences between local control groups by constructing multivariate models to assess the impact of local control type on clinical endpoints (event-free survival [EFS], overall survival, local failure, and distant failure) independent of differences in their propensity to receive each local control type. Patients who underwent surgery were younger (P=.02) and had more appendicular tumors (P<.001). Compared with surgery, radiation had higher unadjusted risks of any event (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.44), death (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.18-2.85), and local failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.37-4.83).

Radiation for bone metastases in Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-10-24,"The role, optimal dose, and efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of bone metastases in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing sarcoma (ES) are unclear. All patients with ES or RMS who received RT for bone metastases with curative intent during frontline therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1995 and 2013 were reviewed. Among the 30 patients (8 RMS and 22 ES), 49 bone metastases were irradiated. Median biologically effective dose (BED) was 42.4 Gy (range, 34.9-59.7) for RMS and 50.7 Gy (range, 31.3-65.8) for ES. Tumor recurrence occurred in six of 49 irradiated bone metastases. Cumulative incidence of local failure at a treated metastatic site was 6.6% at 1 year and 9.0% at 3 years. Dose, fractionation, and RT technique did not impact local control at an irradiated site. The presence of >5 bone metastases was associated with worse local control at an irradiated site (P = 0.07). The 3-year EFS was 33% in RMS and 16% in ES. RT appears to be an effective modality of local control for bone metastases in ES and RMS. Local control at sites of metastatic bone irradiation is similar to local control at the primary site after definitive RT. Doses in the biologic range prescribed for the definitive treatment of primary disease should be used for metastatic sites of disease.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1915.0,8.0,The role optimal dose and efficacy of radiotherapy RT for the treatment of metastases in RMS and ES are unclear All patients with ES or RMS who received RT for metastases with curative intent during frontline therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center MSKCC between 1995 and 2013 were reviewed Among the 30 patients 8 RMS and 22 ES 49 metastases were irradiated Median biologically effective dose BED was 42.4 Gy range 34.9-59.7 for RMS and 50.7 Gy range 31.3-65.8 for ES Tumor recurrence occurred in six of 49 irradiated metastases Cumulative incidence of local failure at a treated metastatic site was 6.6 at 1 year and 9.0 at 3 years Dose fractionation and RT technique did not impact local control at an irradiated site The presence of 5 metastases was associated with worse local control at an irradiated site P 0.07 The 3-year EFS was 33 in RMS and 16 in ES RT appears to be an effective modality of local control for metastases in ES and RMS Local control at sites of metastatic irradiation is similar to local control at the primary site after definitive RT Doses in the biologic range prescribed for the definitive treatment of primary disease should be used for metastatic sites of disease,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 200, 665, 61, 2, 209, 1, 310, 240, 9, 3, 24, 1, 196, 4, 3413, 2, 3011, 32, 1200, 62, 7, 5, 3011, 15, 3413, 54, 103, 240, 9, 196, 5, 1075, 1697, 190, 3171, 36, 28, 2563, 2783, 2784, 12, 574, 4191, 59, 2323, 2, 1346, 11, 446, 107, 3, 201, 7, 66, 3413, 2, 350, 3011, 739, 196, 11, 2398, 52, 2665, 323, 61, 2929, 10, 595, 39, 381, 184, 562, 83, 728, 67, 9, 3413, 2, 212, 67, 381, 184, 456, 27, 556, 66, 9, 3011, 30, 146, 489, 4, 437, 1, 739, 2398, 196, 967, 287, 1, 293, 496, 28, 8, 73, 113, 606, 10, 49, 49, 28, 14, 111, 2, 83, 13, 28, 27, 60, 61, 3519, 2, 240, 1312, 205, 44, 345, 293, 182, 28, 35, 2398, 606, 3, 463, 1, 33, 196, 10, 41, 5, 639, 293, 182, 28, 35, 2398, 606, 19, 13, 1615, 3, 27, 111, 1683, 10, 466, 4, 3413, 2, 245, 4, 3011, 240, 1233, 6, 40, 35, 323, 1396, 1, 293, 182, 9, 196, 4, 3011, 2, 3413, 293, 182, 28, 633, 1, 113, 1104, 16, 288, 6, 293, 182, 28, 3, 86, 606, 50, 1057, 240, 415, 4, 3, 1283, 184, 2746, 9, 3, 1057, 24, 1, 86, 34, 257, 40, 95, 9, 113, 633, 1, 34]",1206.0,"['role', 'optimal', 'dose', 'efficacy', 'radiotherapy', 'rt', 'treatment', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'rms', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'unclear', 'patient', 'rms', 'received', 'rt', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'curative', 'intent', 'frontline', 'therapy', 'memorial', 'sloan', 'kettering', 'center', 'mskcc', 'reviewed', 'patient', 'rms', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'irradiated', 'median', 'biologically', 'effective', 'dose', 'bed', 'wa', 'gy', 'range', 'rms', 'gy', 'range', 'recurrence', 'occurred', 'irradiated', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'cumulative', 'incidence', 'local', 'failure', 'treated', 'metastatic', 'site', 'wa', 'year', 'year', 'dose', 'fractionation', 'rt', 'technique', 'impact', 'local', 'control', 'irradiated', 'site', 'presence', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'wa', 'associated', 'worse', 'local', 'control', 'irradiated', 'site', 'year', 'efs', 'wa', 'rms', 'rt', 'appears', 'effective', 'modality', 'local', 'control', 'bone', 'metastasis', 'rms', 'local', 'control', 'site', 'metastatic', 'bone', 'irradiation', 'similar', 'local', 'control', 'primary', 'site', 'definitive', 'rt', 'dos', 'biologic', 'range', 'prescribed', 'definitive', 'treatment', 'primary', 'disease', 'metastatic', 'site', 'disease']",25346208,80,0.3686635944700461
BCOR-CCNB3 fusions are frequent in undifferentiated sarcomas of male children.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2014-10-31,"The BCOR-CCNB3 fusion gene, resulting from a chromosome X paracentric inversion, was recently described in translocation-negative 'Ewing-like' sarcomas arising in bone and soft tissue. Genetic subclassification of undifferentiated unclassified sarcomas may potentially offer markers for reproducible diagnosis and substrates for therapy. Using whole transcriptome paired-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) we unexpectedly identified BCOR-CCNB3 fusion transcripts in an undifferentiated spindle-cell sarcoma. RNA-seq results were confirmed through direct RT-PCR of tumor RNA and cloning of the genomic breakpoints from tumor DNA. Five additional undifferentiated sarcomas with BCOR-CCNB3 fusions were identified in a series of 42 pediatric and adult unclassified sarcomas. Genomic breakpoint analysis demonstrated unique breakpoint locations in each case at the DNA level even though the resulting fusion mRNA was identical in all cases. All patients with BCOR-CCNB3 sarcoma were males diagnosed in mid childhood (7-13 years of age). Tumors were equally distributed between axial and extra-axial locations. Five of the six tumors were soft-tissue lesions with either predominant spindle-cell morphology or spindle-cell areas interspersed with ovoid to round cells. CCNB3 immunohistochemistry showed strong nuclear positivity in five tumors before oncologic therapy, but was patchy to negative in post-treatment tumor samples. An RT-PCR assay developed to detect the fusion transcript in archival formalin-fixed tissue was positive in all six cases, with high sensitivity and specificity in both pre- and post-treated samples. This study adds to recent reports on the clinicopathologic spectrum of BCOR-CCNB3 fusion-positive sarcomas, a newly emerging entity within the undifferentiated unclassified sarcoma category and describes a simple RT-PCR assay that in conjunction with CCNB3 immunohistochemistry can be useful in diagnosing these tumors.

Phase II study of olaparib in patients with refractory Ewing sarcoma following failure of standard chemotherapy.,BMC cancer,BMC Cancer,2014-11-05,"Preclinical studies have documented antitumor activity of PARP inhibition both in vitro and in vivo, against Ewing sarcoma cells. This study aimed to translate that observation into a clinical trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma (EWS) progressing after prior chemotherapy. In this nonrandomized phase II trial, adult participants with radiographically measureable metastatic EWS received olaparib tablets, 400 mg orally twice daily, until disease progression or drug intolerance. Tumor measurements were determined by CT or MRI at 6 and 12 weeks after starting olaparib administration, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Tumor response determinations were made according to RECIST 1.1, and adverse event determinations were made according to CTCAE, version 4.0. A total of 22 participants were planned to be enrolled using a conventional 2-step phase II study design. If no objective responses were observed after 12 participants had been followed for at least 3 months, further accrual would be stopped. 12 participants were enrolled, and all were evaluable. There were no objective responses (PR/CR), 4 SD (duration 10.9, 11.4, 11.9, and 17.9 wks), and 8 PD as best response. Of the SD, 2 had minor responses (-9% and -11.7% by RECIST 1.1). The median time to disease progression was 5.7 weeks. Further enrollment was therefore discontinued. No significant or unexpected toxicities were observed with olaparib, with only a single case each of grade 3 anemia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia observed. This study is the first report of a prospective phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma after failure of standard chemotherapy. Olaparib administration was safe and well tolerated when administered to this small heavily pre-treated cohort at the 400 mg BID dose, although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 weeks. No significant responses or durable disease control was seen, and the short average interval to disease progression underscores the aggressiveness of this disease. Other studies to combine cytotoxic chemotherapy with PARP inhibition in EWS are actively ongoing.

intolerance Tumor measurements were determined by CT or MRI at 6 and 12 weeks after starting olaparib administration and then every 8 weeks thereafter Tumor response determinations were made according to RECIST 1.1 and adverse event determinations were made according to CTCAE version 4.0 A total of 22 participants were planned to be enrolled using a conventional 2-step phase II study design If no objective responses were observed after 12 participants had been followed for at least 3 months further accrual would be stopped 12 participants were enrolled and all were evaluable There were no objective responses PR/CR 4 SD duration 10.9 11.4 11.9 and 17.9 wks and 8 PD as best response Of the SD 2 had minor responses -9 and -11.7 by RECIST 1.1 The median time to disease progression was 5.7 weeks Further enrollment was therefore discontinued No significant or unexpected toxicities were observed with olaparib with only a single case each of grade 3 anemia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia observed This study is the first report of a prospective phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced after failure of standard chemotherapy Olaparib administration was safe and well tolerated when administered to this small heavily pre-treated cohort at the 400 mg BID dose although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 weeks No significant responses or durable disease control was seen and the short average interval to disease progression underscores the aggressiveness of this disease Other studies to combine cytotoxic chemotherapy with PARP inhibition in EWS are actively ongoing ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01583543,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[693, 94, 47, 1405, 579, 128, 1,

They include pediatric embryonal tumors (neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma), as well as adult cancers (small cell lung cancer, melanoma, soft tissue sarcomas). Because of its restricted normal tissue distribution, GD2 has been proven safe for antibody targeting. Anti-GD2 antibody is now incorporated into the standard of care for the treatment of high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma. Building on this experience, novel combinations of antibodies, cytokines, cells, and genetically engineered products all directed at GD2 are rapidly moving into the clinic.

Phase II study of cixutumumab in combination with temsirolimus in pediatric patients and young adults with recurrent or refractory sarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2014-11-28,"The combined inhibition of insulin-growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has shown activity in preclinical models of pediatric sarcoma and in adult sarcoma patients. We evaluated the activity of the anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other soft tissue sarcoma, using the recommended dosages from a pediatric phase I trial. Cixutumumab 6 mg/kg and temsirolimus 8 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously once weekly in 4-week cycles to patients <30 years. Temsirolimus was escalated to 10 mg/m(2) for subsequent cycles in patients who did not experience unacceptable first-cycle toxicity. A two-stage design was used to identify a response rate <10 or >35% for each tumor-specific cohort. Tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for potential biomarkers of response. Forty-three evaluable patients received a median of 2 cycles (range 1-7). No objective responses were observed, and 16% of patients were progression-free at 12 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 15 (16%) of 92 cycles. The most common toxicities were mucositis, electrolyte disturbances, and myelosuppression. The majority of patients receiving a second cycle were not eligible for temsirolimus escalation due to first-cycle toxicity. The lack of objective responses precluded correlation with tissue biomarkers. Despite encouraging preclinical data, the combination of cixutumumab and temsirolimus did not result in objective responses in this phase II trial of pediatric and young adults with recurrent or refractory sarcoma.","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1880.0,42.0,The combined inhibition of insulin-growth factor type 1 receptor IGF-1R and the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR has shown activity in preclinical models of pediatric and in adult patients We evaluated the activity of the anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory and other soft tissue using the recommended dosages from a pediatric phase I trial Cixutumumab 6 mg/kg and temsirolimus 8 mg/m 2 were administered intravenously once weekly in 4-week cycles to patients 30 years Temsirolimus was escalated to 10 mg/m 2 for subsequent cycles in patients who did not experience unacceptable first-cycle toxicity A two-stage design was used to identify a response rate 10 or 35 for each tumor-specific cohort Tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for potential biomarkers of response Forty-three evaluable patients received a median of 2 cycles range 1-7 No objective responses were observed and 16 of patients were progression-free at 12 weeks Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 15 16 of 92 cycles The most common toxicities were mucositis electrolyte disturbances and myelosuppression The majority of patients receiving a second cycle were not eligible for temsirolimus escalation due to first-cycle toxicity The lack of objective responses precluded correlation with tissue biomarkers Despite encouraging preclinical data the combination of cixutumumab and temsirolimus did not result in objective responses in this phase II trial of pediatric and young adults with recurrent or refractory,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 397, 297, 1, 1601, 129, 161, 267, 14, 153, 1273, 2994, 2, 3, 2359, 283, 1, 1620, 873, 71, 443, 128, 4, 693, 274, 1, 815, 2, 4, 780, 7, 21, 194, 3, 128, 1, 3, 312, 1273, 2994, 548, 7180, 5, 3, 873, 230, 2831, 4, 7, 5, 591, 15, 430, 2, 127, 1214, 246, 75, 3, 793, 7352, 29, 8, 815, 124, 70, 160, 7180, 49, 81, 503, 2, 2831, 66, 81, 188, 18, 11, 468, 1672, 1059, 709, 4, 39, 647, 410, 6, 7, 201, 60, 2831, 10, 2842, 6, 79, 81, 188, 18, 9, 706, 410, 4, 7, 54, 205, 44, 730, 3215, 157, 417, 155, 8, 100, 82, 771, 10, 95, 6, 255, 8, 51, 116, 79, 15, 465, 9, 296, 30, 112, 180, 30, 246, 10, 311, 20, 888, 9, 174, 582, 1, 51, 1213, 169, 859, 7, 103, 8, 52, 1, 18, 410, 184, 14, 67, 77, 461, 253, 11, 164, 2, 245, 1, 7, 11, 91, 115, 28, 133, 244, 61, 817, 155, 10, 164, 4, 167, 245, 1, 937, 410, 3, 96, 186, 385, 11, 2606, 10834, 6741, 2, 2858, 3, 686, 1, 7, 357, 8, 419, 417, 11, 44, 625, 9, 2831, 1125, 520, 6, 157, 417, 155, 3, 926, 1, 461, 253, 8035, 816, 5, 246, 582, 550, 2269, 693, 74, 3, 150, 1, 7180, 2, 2831, 205, 44, 757, 4, 461, 253, 4, 26, 124, 215, 160, 1, 815, 2, 1169, 857, 5, 387, 15, 430]",1571.0,"['combined', 'inhibition', 'insulin', 'growth', 'factor', 'type', 'receptor', 'igf', 'mammalian', 'target', 'rapamycin', 'mtor', 'ha', 'shown', 'activity', 'preclinical', 'model', 'pediatric', 'sarcoma', 'adult', 'sarcoma', 'patient', 'evaluated', 'activity', 'anti', 'igf', 'antibody', 'cixutumumab', 'mtor', 'inhibitor', 'temsirolimus', 'patient', 'relapsed', 'refractory', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'osteosarcoma', 'soft', 'tissue', 'sarcoma', 'recommended', 'dosage', 'pediatric', 'phase', 'trial', 'cixutumumab', 'mg', 'temsirolimus', 'mg', 'administered', 'intravenously', 'weekly', 'week', 'cycle', 'patient', 'year', 'temsirolimus', 'wa', 'escalated', 'mg', 'subsequent', 'cycle', 'patient', 'experience', 'unacceptable', 'cycle', 'toxicity', 'stage', 'design', 'wa', 'identify', 'response', 'rate', 'specific', 'cohort', 'tissue', 'wa', 'potential', 'biomarkers', 'response', 'evaluable', 'patient', 'received', 'median', 'cycle', 'range', 'objective', 'response', 'observed', 'patient', 'progression', 'free', 'week', 'dose', 'limiting', 'toxicity', 'wa', 'observed', 'cycle', 'common', 'toxicity', 'mucositis', 'electrolyte', 'disturbance', 'majority', 'patient', 'receiving', 'second', 'cycle', 'eligible', 'temsirolimus', 'escalation', 'cycle', 'toxicity', 'lack', 'objective', 'response', 'precluded', 'correlation', 'tissue', 'biomarkers', 'despite', 'encouraging', 'preclinical', 'combination', 'cixutumumab', 'temsirolimus', 'objective', 'response', 'phase', 'ii', 'trial', 'pediatric', 'young', 'adult', 'recurrent', 'refractory', 'sarcoma']",25446280,16,0.07373271889400922
Pediatric bone sarcoma: diagnostic performance of ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT versus conventional imaging for initial staging and follow-up.,AJR. American journal of roentgenology,AJR Am J Roentgenol,2015-01-01,"The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and conventional imaging for staging and follow-up of pediatric osteosarcoma and skeletal Ewing sarcoma. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PET/CT and conventional imaging (CT, MRI, bone scanning) for sites of disease and number of lesions. Diagnostic benefit, defined as better characterization of lesions, was evaluated on a per-scan basis, comparing PET/CT and conventional imaging. A total of 412 lesions were characterized by imaging in 64 patients (20, osteosarcoma; 44, Ewing sarcoma). For osteosarcoma patients PET/CT was available only at follow-up, where it proved more accurate than conventional imaging for the detection of bone lesions (accuracy, 95% vs 67% for CT and 86% for MRI) and complementary to CT in evaluating lung nodules (sensitivity, 84% vs 94%; specificity, 79% vs 71%) with diagnostic benefit in 18% of examinations. In patients with Ewing sarcoma, PET/CT tended to perform better during follow-up than at initial staging (accuracy, 85% vs 69%). For lung findings, PET/CT was more specific than CT but was less sensitive. The diagnostic benefit of PET/CT was greater at staging (28%) than during followup (9%).

Chemotherapy for bone sarcomas in adults: the MD anderson experience.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2015-01-01,"Increasing age is an adverse prognostic factor in the treatment of primary bone tumors. There are few published data on treatment of primary bone tumors in adults. This paper presents data from the Department of Sarcoma Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, summarizing our treatment results. To treat primary osteosarcoma, we used 90 mg/m2 of doxorubicin as a continuous intravenous infusion over 48 to 96 hours and 120 to 160 mg/m2 of cisplatin intravenously or intra-arterially. Initially, we found a marked difference in postoperative continuous disease-free survival (CDFS) between those with 90% or greater (i.e., good response) tumor necrosis and those with less than 90% (i.e., poor response) tumor necrosis. The sequential addition of high-dose methotrexate and ifosfamide to patients with poorly responding disease improved their CDFS to that of patients with good response. Older patients and those who have tumors with variant histology have inferior outcomes. Evaluation of subsequent patients revealed similar outcomes for those with good or poor response to induction therapy, supporting our practice of adaptation of postoperative chemotherapy to the results of preoperative chemotherapy. PET-CT is the best imaging modality to screen for a response with tumors inside bone. To treat Ewing sarcoma, we have employed 2 mg of vincristine, 75 to 90 mg/m2 of doxorubicin as a 72-hour infusion, and 2.5 g/m2 of ifosfamide over 3 hours daily for 4 doses (i.e., vincristine, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide [VAI]). Preliminary analysis indicates a higher CDFS when adjusted for patient age than seen with the standard alternating regimen used in pediatrics. A screening MRI of the pelvis and spine can detect subtle metastatic disease in bone or bone marrow that is missed by other imaging modalities or blind biopsy.

"A phase I trial combining decitabine/dendritic cell vaccine targeting MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 for children with relapsed or therapy-refractory neuroblastoma and sarcoma.","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,2015-06-24,"Antigen-specific immunotherapy was studied in a multi-institutional phase 1/2 study by combining decitabine (DAC) followed by an autologous dendritic cell (DC)/MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. Patients aged 2.5-15 years with relapsed neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were eligible to receive DAC followed by DC pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from full-length MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1. The primary endpoints were to assess the feasibility and tolerability of this regimen. Each of four cycles consisted of week 1: DAC 10 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days and weeks 2 and 3: DC vaccine once weekly. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, of which 10 were evaluable. Generation of DC was highly feasible for all enrolled patients. The treatment regimen was generally well tolerated, with the major toxicity being DAC-related myelosuppression in 5/10 patients. Six of nine patients developed a response to MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 or NY-ESO-1 peptides post-vaccine. Due to limitations in number of cells available for analysis, controls infected with a virus encoding relevant genes have not been performed. Objective responses were documented in 1/10 patients who had a complete response.

IGF1R- and ROR1-Specific CAR T Cells as a Potential Therapy for High Risk Sarcomas.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2015-07-14,"Patients with metastatic or recurrent and refractory sarcomas have a dismal prognosis. Therefore, new targeted therapies are urgently needed. This study was designed to evaluate chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) or tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) molecules for their therapeutic potential against sarcomas. Here, we report that IGF1R (15/15) and ROR1 (11/15) were highly expressed in sarcoma cell lines including Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, alveolar or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from eight healthy donors using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system were cytotoxic against sarcoma cells and produced high levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-13 in an antigen-specific manner. IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells generated from three sarcoma patients released significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to sarcoma stimulation. The adoptive transfer of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells derived from a sarcoma patient significantly reduced tumor growth in pre-established, systemically disseminated and localized osteosarcoma xenograft models in NSG mice. Infusion of IGF1R and ROR1 CAR T cells also prolonged animal survival in a localized sarcoma model using NOD/scid mice. Our data indicate that both IGF1R and ROR1 can be effectively targeted by SB modified CAR T cells and that such CAR T cells may be useful in the treatment of high risk sarcoma patients.

Clinical features and outcomes of infants with Ewing sarcoma under 12 months of age.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-07-14,"Ewing sarcoma peaks in incidence in adolescence. Infants <12 months old have rarely been reported. We aimed to compare clinical features, treatment, and survival of infants <12 months to those of older pediatric patients with Ewing sarcoma. We utilized the SEER database to identify patients <12 months of age diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma between 1973 and 2011. We used Fisher exact tests to compare clinical features and treatment modalities between these patients and patients aged 1-19 years. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to describe overall survival in these two groups. Of 1,957 patients in the cohort, 39 (2.0%) were diagnosed at <12 months of age. Infants had a different distribution of primary tumor sites, with lower extremity tumors under represented. Compared to older patients, infants were more likely to have soft tissue tumors (81.6% vs. 27.1%; P < 0.001); have primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Askin tumor (61.5% vs. 19.9%; P < 0.001); and have tumors <8 cm (81.0% vs. 53.2%; P < 0.014). Infants were less likely to receive radiation therapy (13.2% vs. 53.3%; P < 0.001). Infants were at increased risk for early death (P < 0.013 by Wilcoxon), though long-term overall survival was not different between age groups (P < 0.25 by log rank).

Identification of Discrete Prognostic Groups in Ewing Sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2015-08-10,"Although multiple prognostic variables have been proposed for Ewing sarcoma (EWS), little work has been done to further categorize these variables into prognostic groups for risk classification. We derived initial prognostic groups from 2,124 patients with EWS in the SEER database. We constructed a multivariable recursive partitioning model of overall survival using the following covariates: age; stage; race/ethnicity; sex; axial primary; pelvic primary; and bone or soft tissue primary. Based on this model, we identified risk groups and estimated 5-year overall survival for each group using Kaplan-Meier methods. We then applied these groups to 1,680 patients enrolled on COG clinical trials. A multivariable model identified five prognostic groups with significantly different overall survival: (i) localized, age <18 years, non-pelvic primary; (ii) localized, age <18, pelvic primary or localized, age ≥18, white, non-Hispanic; (iii) localized, age ≥18, all races/ethnicities other than white, non-Hispanic; (iv) metastatic, age <18; and (v) metastatic, age ≥18. These five groups were applied to the COG dataset and showed significantly different overall and event-free survival based upon this classification system (P < 0.0001).

The second European interdisciplinary Ewing sarcoma research summit--A joint effort to deconstructing the multiple layers of a complex disease.,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,2016-02-01,"Despite multimodal treatment, long term outcome for patients with Ewing sarcoma is still poor. The second ""European interdisciplinary Ewing sarcoma research summit"" assembled a large group of scientific experts in the field to discuss their latest unpublished findings on the way to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by a quiet genome with presence of an EWSR1-ETS gene rearrangement as the only and defining genetic aberration. RNA-sequencing of recently described Ewing-like sarcomas with variant translocations identified them as biologically distinct diseases. Various presentations adressed mechanisms of EWS-ETS fusion protein activities with a focus on EWS-FLI1. Data were presented shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of genetic permissiveness to this disease uncovering interaction of EWS-FLI1 with recently discovered susceptibility loci. Epigenetic context as a consequence of the interaction between the oncoprotein, cell type, developmental stage, and tissue microenvironment emerged as dominant theme in the discussion of the molecular pathogenesis and inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of Ewing sarcoma, and the difficulty to generate animal models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. The problem of preclinical development of biologically targeted therapeutics was discussed and promising perspectives were offered from the study of novel in vitro models. Finally, it was concluded that in order to facilitate rapid pre-clinical and clinical development of novel therapies in Ewing sarcoma, the community needs a platform to maintain knowledge of unpublished results, systems and models used in drug testing and to continue the open dialogue initiated at the first two Ewing sarcoma summits.

Impact of Two Measures of Micrometastatic Disease on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ewing Sarcoma: A Report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2016-02-09,"Flow cytometry and RT-PCR can detect occult Ewing sarcoma cells in the blood and bone marrow. These techniques were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of micrometastatic disease in Ewing sarcoma. Newly diagnosed patients with Ewing sarcoma were enrolled on two prospective multicenter studies. In the flow cytometry cohort, patients were defined as ""positive"" for bone marrow micrometastatic disease if their CD99(+)/CD45(-) values were above the upper limit in 22 control patients. In the PCR cohort, RT-PCR on blood or bone marrow samples classified the patients as ""positive"" or ""negative"" for EWSR1/FLI1 translocations. The association between micrometastatic disease burden with clinical features and outcome was assessed. Coexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) on detected tumor cells was performed in a subset of flow cytometry samples. The median total bone marrow CD99(+)CD45(-) percent was 0.0012% (range 0%-1.10%) in the flow cytometry cohort, with 14 of 109 (12.8%) of Ewing sarcoma patients defined as ""positive."" In the PCR cohort, 19.6% (44/225) patients were ""positive"" for any EWSR1/FLI1 translocation in blood or bone marrow. There were no differences in baseline clinical features or event-free or overall survival between patients classified as ""positive"" versus ""negative"" by either method. CD99(+)CD45(-) cells had significantly higher IGF-1R expression compared with CD45(+) hematopoietic cells (mean geometric mean fluorescence intensity 982.7 vs. 190.9; P < 0.001).

Conditional Survival and Predictors of Late Death in Patients With Ewing Sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-02-17,"Long-term survivors of Ewing sarcoma (EWS) are at considerable risk for future complications, including late relapse and death. Data on prognostic factors for late death in those who have survived beyond 5 years are lacking. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We obtained clinical features and outcome data on 1,351 patients with EWS who had survived 60 months or more. From these data, we performed univariate and multivariable analyses of overall survival (OS) using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models. Of 1,351 patients in the cohort, there were 209 deaths, 144 (69%) of which were reported to be due to EWS. The OS for 5-year survivors at 10 years was 87.5% (95% confidence interval 85.4-89.3%). Univariate adverse prognostic factors for late death in 5-year survivors included age ≥ 18 years at initial diagnosis, male sex, and axial/pelvic primary site. Initial stage was not prognostic. Independent adverse prognostic factors for late death included black race (hazard ratio [HR] 2.16, P = 0.01), age ≥ 18 years at diagnosis (HR 2.02, P < 0.001), male sex (HR 1.43, P = 0.01), and axial/pelvic primary site (HR 1.43, P = 0.02).

Three-dimensional Radiologic Assessment of Chemotherapy Response in Ewing Sarcoma Can Be Used to Predict Clinical Outcome.,Radiology,Radiology,2016-03-16,"Purpose To compare the agreement of three-dimensional (3D) tumor measurements for therapeutic response assessment of Ewing sarcoma according to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) criteria, one-dimensional (1D) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and two-dimensional (2D) measurements defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) with tumor volume measurements as the standard of reference and to determine which method correlates best with clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board of three institutions. Seventy-four patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 14.5 years ± 6.5) with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma treated at three medical centers were evaluated. Primary tumor size was assessed on pre- and posttreatment magnetic resonance images according to 1D RECIST, 2D WHO, and 3D COG measurements. Tumor responses were compared with the standard of reference (tumor volume) on the basis of RECIST, COG, and WHO therapeutic response thresholds. Agreement between the percentage reduction measurements of the methods was assessed with concordance correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Spearman rank correlation. Agreement between therapeutic responses was assessed with Kendall tau and unweighted κ statistics. Tumor responses were compared with patient survival by using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier plots, and Cox regression. Results Agreement with the reference standard was significantly better for 3D measurement than for 1D and 2D measurements on the basis of RECIST and COG therapeutic response thresholds (concordance correlation of 0.41, 0.72, and 0.84 for 1D, 2D, and 3D measurements, respectively; P < .0001). Comparison of overall survival of responders and nonresponders demonstrated P values of .4133, .0112, .0032, and .0027 for 1D, 2D, 3D, and volume measurements, respectively, indicating that higher dimensional measurements were significantly better predictors of overall survival. Conclusion The 3D tumor measurements according to COG are better predictors of therapeutic response of Ewing sarcoma than 1D RECIST or 2D WHO measurements and show a significantly higher correlation with clinical outcomes.

Phase 1 study of dalotuzumab monotherapy and ridaforolimus-dalotuzumab combination therapy in paediatric patients with advanced solid tumours.,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",Eur. J. Cancer,2016-05-10,"Dalotuzumab is a highly specific, humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody against insulin-like growth factor receptor 1. This multicenter phase 1 study (NCT01431547) explored the safety and pharmacokinetics of dalotuzumab monotherapy (part 1) and the combination of dalotuzumab with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus (part 2) in paediatric patients with advanced solid tumours. Dalotuzumab was administered intravenously every 3 weeks starting at 900 mg/m(2) and escalating to 1200 and 1500 mg/m(2). Combination therapy included intravenous dalotuzumab at the defined single-agent recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and oral ridaforolimus 28 mg/m(2) daily (days 1-5), repeated weekly. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to evaluate the mean serum trough dalotuzumab concentration, which guided the RP2D. Twenty-four patients were enrolled (part 1, n = 20; part 2, n = 4). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in patients receiving dalotuzumab alone. One patient experienced dose-limiting stomatitis in the combination arm. Pharmacokinetic data showed dose-dependent increases in exposure (area under the curve from zero to infinity [AUC0-∞]) (87,900, 164,000, and 186,000 h*mg/ml for the 900, 1200, and 1500 mg/m(2) dose levels, respectively), maximum serum concentration (Cmax) (392, 643, and 870 mg/ml), and serum trough concentration (Ctrough) (67.1, 71.6, and 101 mg/ml). The mean half-life was 265, 394, and 310 h, respectively. Dalotuzumab pharmacokinetics were not affected by coadministration with ridaforolimus. One of six patients with Ewing sarcoma had confirmed partial response to dalotuzumab monotherapy at 900 mg/m(2). Time to response was 41 d, and progression occurred at 126 d. Dalotuzumab was well tolerated in paediatric patients with advanced solid malignancies.

Local Control Modality and Outcome for Ewing Sarcoma of the Femur: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-05-23,"The choice of a local control (LC) modality for Ewing sarcoma (EWS) of the femur is controversial. This study aimed to determine the effect of LC modality on tumor LC and patient outcomes. The study reviewed the treatment and outcomes for 115 patients who had EWS of the femur treated with similar chemotherapy in three cooperative group trials. Patient outcomes were analyzed according to the LC modality using the log-rank test and the cumulative incidence of local or distant failure using competing risks regression. The median age of the patients was 13 years. The most common tumor location was the proximal femur followed by the mid femur. For 55 patients with available data, the tumor was larger than 8 cm in 29 patients and 8 cm or smaller in 26 patients. For 84 patients (73 %), surgery only was performed, whereas 17 patients (15 %) had surgery plus radiation, and 14 patients (12 %) had radiation only. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 65 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 55-73 %), and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70 % (95 % CI, 61-78 %). Patient outcomes did not differ significantly according to tumor location within the femur (proximal, mid or distal) or tumor size (<8 vs ≥8 cm). The findings showed no statistically significant differences in EFS, OS, cumulative incidence of local failure, or cumulative incidence of distant failure according to LC modality (surgery, surgery plus radiation, or radiation).

Proteasome Addiction Defined in Ewing Sarcoma Is Effectively Targeted by a Novel Class of 19S Proteasome Inhibitors.,Cancer research,Cancer Res.,2016-06-02,"Ewing sarcoma is a primitive round cell sarcoma with a peak incidence in adolescence that is driven by a chimeric oncogene created from the fusion of the EWSR1 gene with a member of the ETS family of genes. Patients with metastatic and recurrent disease have dismal outcomes and need better therapeutic options. We screened a library of 309,989 chemical compounds for growth inhibition of Ewing sarcoma cells to provide the basis for the development of novel therapies and to discover vulnerable pathways that might broaden our understanding of the pathobiology of this aggressive sarcoma. This screening campaign identified a class of benzyl-4-piperidone compounds that selectively inhibit the growth of Ewing sarcoma cell lines by inducing apoptosis. These agents disrupt 19S proteasome function through inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzymes USP14 and UCHL5. Functional genomic data from a genome-wide shRNA screen in Ewing sarcoma cells also identified the proteasome as a node of vulnerability in Ewing sarcoma cells, providing orthologous confirmation of the chemical screen findings. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated silencing of USP14 or UCHL5 in Ewing sarcoma cells produced significant growth inhibition. Finally, treatment of a xenograft mouse model of Ewing sarcoma with VLX1570, a benzyl-4-piperidone compound derivative currently in clinical trials for relapsed multiple myeloma, significantly inhibited in vivo tumor growth.

Comparison of clinical features and outcomes in patients with extraskeletal versus skeletal localized Ewing sarcoma: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-06-14,"The prognostic significance of having extraskeletal (EES) versus skeletal Ewing sarcoma (ES) in the setting of modern chemotherapy protocols is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics, biologic features, and outcomes for patients with EES and skeletal ES. Patients had localized ES and were treated on two consecutive protocols using five-drug chemotherapy (INT-0154 and AEWS0031). Patients were analyzed based on having an extraskeletal (n = 213) or skeletal (n = 826) site of tumor origin. Event-free survival (EFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, compared using the log-rank test, and modeled using Cox multivariate regression. Patients with extraskeletal ES (EES) were more likely to have axial tumors (72% vs. 55%; P < 0.001), less likely to have tumors >8 cm (9% vs. 17%; P < 0.01), and less likely to be white (81% vs. 87%; P < 0.001) compared to patients with skeletal ES. There was no difference in key genomic features (type of EWSR1 translocation, TP53 mutation, CDKN2A mutation/loss) between groups. After controlling for age, race, and primary site, EES was associated with superior EFS (hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.95; P = 0.02). Among patients with EES, age ≥18, nonwhite race, and elevated baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate were independently associated with inferior EFS.

GD2-specific antibody is currently a standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma therapy. In this study, the pattern of GD2 and GD3 expression among pediatric/adolescent or young adult tumors was determined, providing companion diagnostics for targeted therapy. Ninety-two specimens of human osteosarcoma (OS), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Ewing family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), and melanoma were analyzed for GD2/GD3 expression by immunohistochemistry. Murine monoclonal antibody 3F8 was used for GD2 staining, and R24 for GD3. Staining was scored according to both intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells from 0 to 4. Both gangliosides were highly prevalent in OS and melanoma. Among other tumors, GD3 expression was higher than GD2 expression. Most OS samples demonstrated strong staining for GD2 and GD3, whereas expression for other tumors was highly variable. Mean intensity of GD2 expression was significantly more heterogeneous (P < 0.001) when compared to GD3 across tumor types. When assessing the difference between GD2 and GD3 expression in all tumor types combined, GD3 expression had a significantly higher score (P = 0.049). When analyzed within each cancer, GD3 expression was significantly higher only in DSRCT (P = 0.002). There was no statistical difference in either GD2 or GD3 expression between primary and recurrent sarcomas.

A phase II study of clinical activity of SCH 717454 (robatumumab) in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-06-30,"Robatumumab (19D12; MK-7454 otherwise known as SCH717454) is a fully human antibody that binds to and inhibits insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R). This multiinstitutional study (P04720) determined the safety and clinical efficacy of robatumumab in three separate patient groups with resectable osteosarcoma metastases (Group 1), unresectable osteosarcoma metastases (Group 2), and Ewing sarcoma metastases (Group 3). Robatumumab infusions were administered every 2 weeks and were well tolerated with minimal toxicity. Centrally reviewed response data were available for 144 patients. Low disease burden was important for osteosarcoma response: three of 31 patients had complete response or partial response (PR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) in resectable patients (Group 1) versus zero of 29 in unresectable patients (Group 2); median overall survival was 20 months in Group 1 versus 8.2 months in Group 2. In centrally reviewed patients with Ewing sarcoma with PET-CT data (N = 84/115), there were six PR, 23 stable disease, and 55 progression of disease by RECIST at 2 months. Patients with Ewing sarcoma had a median overall survival of 6.9 months. However, responding patients with Ewing sarcoma were allowed to continue on treatment after study closure. A minority of patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma showed clinical responses and have remained healthy after receiving 25-115 doses of robatumumab with remissions of >4 years duration (N = 6). These findings show that although the IGF-1R remains an attractive treatment target, additional research is needed to identify responders and/or means to achieve durable remissions in order to successfully exploit IGF-1R signal blockade in Ewing sarcoma (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00617890).","Clinical Trial, Phase II",1300.0,17.0,Robatumumab 19D12 MK-7454 otherwise known as SCH717454 is a fully human antibody that binds to and inhibits insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 IGF-1R This multiinstitutional study P04720 determined the safety and clinical efficacy of robatumumab in three separate patient groups with resectable metastases Group 1 unresectable metastases Group 2 and metastases Group 3 Robatumumab infusions were administered every 2 weeks and were well tolerated with minimal toxicity Centrally reviewed response data were available for 144 patients Low disease burden was important for response three of 31 patients had complete response or partial response PR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST in resectable patients Group 1 versus zero of 29 in unresectable patients Group 2 median overall survival was 20 months in Group 1 versus 8.2 months in Group 2 In centrally reviewed patients with with PET-CT data N 84/115 there were six PR 23 stable disease and 55 progression of disease by RECIST at 2 months Patients with had a median overall survival of 6.9 months However responding patients with were allowed to continue on treatment after study closure A minority of patients with metastatic showed clinical responses and have remained healthy after receiving 25-115 doses of robatumumab with remissions of 4 years duration N 6 These findings show that although the IGF-1R remains an attractive treatment target additional research is needed to identify responders and/or means to achieve durable remissions in order to successfully exploit IGF-1R signal blockade in clinicaltrials.gov NCT00617890,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[22844, 68506, 3558, 68507, 2632, 440, 22, 68508, 16, 8, 1910, 171, 548, 17, 3333, 6, 2, 1576, 1601, 733, 129, 161, 153, 14, 1273, 2994, 26, 13781, 45, 68509, 509, 3, 367, 2, 38, 209, 1, 22844, 4, 169, 2282, 69, 271, 5, 1899, 196, 87, 14, 1468, 196, 87, 18, 2, 196, 87, 27, 22844, 3435, 11, 468, 454, 18, 244, 2, 11, 149, 421, 5, 1048, 155, 4604, 446, 51, 74, 11, 390, 9, 4415, 7, 154, 34, 892, 10, 305, 9, 51, 169, 1, 456, 7, 42, 236, 51, 15, 450, 51, 998, 20, 51, 451, 371, 4, 537, 57, 1834, 4, 1899, 7, 87, 14, 185, 5115, 1, 462, 4, 1468, 7, 87, 18, 52, 63, 25, 10, 179, 53, 4, 87, 14, 185, 66, 18, 53, 4, 87, 18, 4, 4604, 446, 7, 5, 5, 495, 425, 74, 78, 874, 3670, 125, 11, 437, 998, 382, 585, 34, 2, 614, 91, 1, 34, 20, 1834, 28, 18, 53, 7, 5, 42, 8, 52, 63, 25, 1, 49, 83, 53, 137, 3261, 7, 5, 11, 2313, 6, 1906, 23, 24, 50, 45, 4830, 8, 2652, 1, 7, 5, 113, 224, 38, 253, 2, 47, 958, 1331, 50, 357, 243, 3670, 415, 1, 22844, 5, 3166, 1, 39, 60, 654, 78, 49, 46, 272, 514, 17, 242, 3, 1273, 2994, 469, 35, 3059, 24, 283, 402, 389, 16, 575, 6, 255, 1983, 2, 15, 2263, 6, 1359, 1480, 3166, 4, 1732, 6, 1878, 6109, 1273, 2994, 1235, 1189, 4, 1252, 1239, 68510]",1607.0,"['robatumumab', 'mk', 'known', 'sch', 'fully', 'human', 'antibody', 'bind', 'inhibits', 'insulin', 'like', 'growth', 'factor', 'receptor', 'igf', 'determined', 'safety', 'clinical', 'efficacy', 'robatumumab', 'separate', 'patient', 'group', 'resectable', 'osteosarcoma', 'metastasis', 'group', 'unresectable', 'osteosarcoma', 'metastasis', 'group', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'metastasis', 'group', 'robatumumab', 'infusion', 'administered', 'week', 'tolerated', 'minimal', 'toxicity', 'centrally', 'reviewed', 'response', 'available', 'patient', 'low', 'disease', 'burden', 'wa', 'important', 'osteosarcoma', 'response', 'patient', 'complete', 'response', 'partial', 'response', 'pr', 'response', 'evaluation', 'criterion', 'solid', 'recist', 'resectable', 'patient', 'group', 'versus', 'zero', 'unresectable', 'patient', 'group', 'median', 'overall', 'survival', 'wa', 'month', 'group', 'versus', 'month', 'group', 'centrally', 'reviewed', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'pet', 'ct', 'pr', 'stable', 'disease', 'progression', 'disease', 'recist', 'month', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'median', 'overall', 'survival', 'month', 'responding', 'patient', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'allowed', 'continue', 'treatment', 'closure', 'minority', 'patient', 'metastatic', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'showed', 'clinical', 'response', 'remained', 'healthy', 'receiving', 'dos', 'robatumumab', 'remission', 'year', 'duration', 'finding', 'igf', 'remains', 'attractive', 'treatment', 'target', 'additional', 'research', 'needed', 'identify', 'responder', 'mean', 'achieve', 'durable', 'remission', 'order', 'successfully', 'exploit', 'igf', 'signal', 'blockade', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'clinicaltrials', 'gov', 'nct']",27362300,62,0.2857142857142857
Pediatric Oncology Provider Views on Performing a Biopsy of Solid Tumors in Children with Relapsed or Refractory Disease for the Purpose of Genomic Profiling.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2016-07-26,"Patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumors have a poor prognosis. Recent advances in genomic technology have made it feasible to screen tumors for actionable mutations, with the anticipation that this may provide benefit to patients. Pediatric oncologists were emailed an anonymous 34-question survey assessing their willingness to offer a rebiopsy to patients with relapsed disease for the purpose of tumor genomic profiling. They were presented with two scenarios evaluating morbidity and invasiveness of the procedures using the clinical examples of medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma. A total of 195 pediatric oncologists responded to the questionnaire. Morbidity and invasiveness of the procedure demonstrated significant differences in provider willingness to refer their patients for rebiopsy. The pretest probability was a major variable influencing provider willingness to offer a rebiopsy. Respondents were more likely to offer a rebiopsy if the likelihood was high that the results would have an impact on clinical management than if the biopsy was for histologic confirmation alone (mean 89 vs. 56 %; p = 0.017). Compared with the rate of a rebiopsy for histologic confirmation, significantly fewer providers were willing to offer a rebiopsy if they were led to believe the likelihood of finding an actionable mutation was low (mean 45 vs. 56 %; p = 0.021). The scenario showed that the pretest probability of finding an actionable mutation was influential in determining provider willingness to offer a rebiopsy for the purpose of tumor genomic profiling.

"PAX7 Expression in Rhabdomyosarcoma, Related Soft Tissue Tumors, and Small Round Blue Cell Neoplasms.",The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2016-10-01,"Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common soft tissue malignancy of childhood, is a morphologically variable tumor defined by its phenotype of skeletal muscle differentiation. The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma often relies in part on the identification of myogenic gene expression using immunohistochemical or molecular techniques. However, these techniques show imperfect sensitivity and specificity, particularly in scant tissue biopsies. Here, we expand the toolkit for rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis by studying the expression of PAX7, a transcriptional regulator of mammalian muscle progenitor cells implicated in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays using a monoclonal anti-PAX7 antibody was used to characterize PAX7 expression in 25 non-neoplastic tissues, 109 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 697 small round blue cell or other soft tissue tumors. Among non-neoplastic tissues, PAX7 was specifically expressed in adult muscle progenitor cells (satellite cells). In embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, PAX7 expression was positive in 52 of 63 cases (83%), negative in 9 of 63 cases (14%), and focal in 2 of 63 cases (3%). PAX7-positive embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cases included several showing focal or negative myogenin expression. PAX7 expression in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma was positive in 6 of 31 cases (19%), negative in 14 of 31 cases (45%), and focal in 11 of 31 cases (36%). In addition, PAX7 was expressed in 5 of 7 pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcomas (71%) and 6 of 8 spindle cell rhabdomyosarcomas (75%).

IGF-1R and mTOR Blockade: Novel Resistance Mechanisms and Synergistic Drug Combinations for Ewing Sarcoma.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,J. Natl. Cancer Inst.,2016-08-30,"Therapies cotargeting insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have demonstrated remarkable, albeit short-lived, clinical responses in a subset of Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients. However, the mechanisms of resistance and applicable strategies for overcoming drug resistance to the IGF-1R/mTOR blockade are still undefined. To elucidate predominant mechanism(s) of acquired drug resistance while identifying synergistic drug combinations that improve clinical efficacy, we generated more than 18 ES cell lines resistant to IGF-1R- or mTOR-targeted therapy. Two small-molecule inhibitors of IGF-1R were chosen, NVP-ADW-742 (IGF-1R-selective) and OSI-906 (a dual IGF-1R/insulin receptor alpha [IR-α] inhibitor). Reverse-phase protein lysate arrays (RPPAs) revealed proteomic changes linked to IGF-1R/mTOR resistance, and selected proteins were validated in cell-based assays, xenografts, and within human clinical samples. All statistical tests were two-sided. Novel mechanisms of resistance (MOR) emerged after dalotuzumab-, NVP-ADW-742-, and OSI-906-based targeting of IGF-1R. MOR to dalotuzumab included upregulation of IRS1, PI3K, and STAT3, as well as p38 MAPK, which was also induced by OSI-906. pEIF4E(Ser209), a key regulator of Cap-dependent translation, was induced in ridaforolimus-resistant ES cell lines. Unique drug combinations targeting IGF-1R and PI3K-alpha or Mnk and mTOR were synergistic in vivo and vitro (P < .001) as assessed respectively by Mantel-Cox and isobologram testing.

Ewing sarcoma family of tumors in children younger than 10 years of age.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2016-10-03,"Few data exist regarding the clinical characteristics and outcome of young children with Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT). We reviewed the records of ESFT patients at our institution younger than 10 years of age at diagnosis. Forty-two patients were identified. Median age was 6.4 years (range 0.6-9.5 years). Most patients had T2 (>5 cm) tumors (n = 31; 74%). Most common primary site was the extremity (n = 17; 41%). Seven patients (17%) had metastasis at diagnosis. For local tumor control, 20 patients had surgery only, 13 had radiation therapy only, and 6 had surgery plus radiation. Surgical margin status was negative in 19 patients (73%).

Generation of conditional oncogenic chromosomal translocations using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing and homology-directed repair.,The Journal of pathology,J. Pathol.,2017-03-30,"Chromosomal rearrangements encoding oncogenic fusion proteins are found in a wide variety of malignancies. The use of programmable nucleases to generate specific double-strand breaks in endogenous loci, followed by non-homologous end joining DNA repair, has allowed several of these translocations to be generated as constitutively expressed fusion genes within a cell population. Here, we describe a novel approach that combines CRISPR-Cas9 technology with homology-directed repair to engineer, capture, and modulate the expression of chromosomal translocation products in a human cell line. We have applied this approach to the genetic modelling of t(11;22)(q24;q12) and t(11;22)(p13;q12), translocation products of the EWSR1 gene and its 3' fusion partners FLI1 and WT1, present in Ewing's sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumour, respectively.

Longitudinal follow-up of adult survivors of Ewing sarcoma: A report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,Cancer,Cancer,2017-02-21,"Ewing sarcoma survivors (ESSs) are at increased risk for treatment-related complications. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity and late mortality with aging is unknown. This study reports survival probabilities, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality and chronic conditions among ESSs in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated between 1970 and 1986. Piecewise exponential models were used to estimate relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes. Chronic conditions were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Among 404 5-year ESSs (median age at last follow-up, 34.8 years; range, 9.1-54.8 years), the 35-year survival rate was 70% (95% CI, 66%-74%). Late recurrence (cumulative incidence at 35 years, 15.1%) was the most common cause of death, and it was followed by treatment-related causes (11.2%). There were 53 patients with subsequent neoplasms (SNs; cumulative incidence at 35 years, 24.0%), and 38 were malignant (14.3% at 35 years). The standardized incidence ratios were 377.1 (95% CI, 172.1-715.9) for osteosarcoma, 28.9 (95% CI, 3.2-104.2) for acute myeloid leukemia, 14.9 (95% CI, 7.9-25.5) for breast cancer, and 13.1 (95% CI, 4.8-28.5) for thyroid cancer. Rates of chronic conditions were highest for musculoskeletal (RR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.8-25.7) and cardiac complications (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Thirty-five years after the diagnosis, the cumulative incidences of any chronic conditions and 2 or more chronic conditions were 84.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-88.8%) and 73.8% (95% CI, 67.8%-79.9%), respectively. With extended follow-up, ESSs' risk for late mortality and SNs does not plateau. Treatment-related chronic conditions develop years after therapy, and this supports the need for lifelong follow-up.

Pelvis Ewing sarcoma: Local control and survival in the modern era.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-02-28,"Local control for Ewing sarcoma (ES) has improved in modern studies. However, it is unclear if these gains have also been achieved for pelvis tumors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate local control and survival in pelvis ES patients treated in the modern era. All pelvis ES patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2012 and seen at Mayo Clinic were identified. Factors relevant to survival and local control were analyzed. The cohort consisted of 48 patients. Fifty-two percent had metastatic disease at diagnosis. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival was 73% and 65%, respectively, for localized disease. The 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 19%, with a 26% incidence for radiation, 13% for surgery, and 0% for surgery + radiation (P = 0.54). All local failures occurred in-field. Sacral involvement by tumor trended toward a higher incidence of local recurrence (hazard ratio 3.06, P = 0.09). Patients treated with definitive radiation doses ≥5,600 cGy had a lower incidence of local recurrence (17% vs. 28%, P = 0.61). Our study demonstrates excellent survival for localized tumors in the modern era. Anatomical localization within the pelvis likely correlates with outcomes. Local control remains problematic, especially for patients treated with definitive radiation. Though statistically not significant, surgery + radiation and definitive radiation dose ≥5,600 cGy were associated with the lowest incidence of local failure, suggesting treatment intensification may improve local control for pelvis ES.",Journal Article,1057.0,5.0,"Local control for ES has improved in modern studies However it is unclear if these gains have also been achieved for pelvis tumors The purpose of this study is to evaluate local control and survival in pelvis ES patients treated in the modern era All pelvis ES patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2012 and seen at Mayo Clinic were identified Factors relevant to survival and local control were analyzed The cohort consisted of 48 patients Fifty-two percent had metastatic disease at diagnosis The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival was 73 and 65 respectively for localized disease The 5-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 19 with a 26 incidence for radiation 13 for surgery and 0 for surgery radiation P 0.54 All local failures occurred in-field Sacral involvement by tumor trended toward a higher incidence of local recurrence hazard ratio 3.06 P 0.09 Patients treated with definitive radiation doses ≥5,600 cGy had a lower incidence of local recurrence 17 vs. 28 P 0.61 Our study demonstrates excellent survival for localized tumors in the modern era Anatomical localization within the pelvis likely correlates with outcomes Local control remains problematic especially for patients treated with definitive radiation Though statistically not significant surgery radiation and definitive radiation dose ≥5,600 cGy were associated with the lowest incidence of local failure suggesting treatment intensification may improve local control for pelvis ES",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[293, 182, 9, 3011, 71, 231, 4, 2366, 94, 137, 192, 16, 1200, 492, 46, 3849, 47, 120, 85, 513, 9, 3270, 57, 3, 743, 1, 26, 45, 16, 6, 376, 293, 182, 2, 25, 4, 3270, 3011, 7, 73, 4, 3, 2366, 1713, 62, 3270, 3011, 7, 265, 29, 2289, 6, 1195, 2, 527, 28, 2486, 1188, 11, 108, 130, 867, 6, 25, 2, 293, 182, 11, 311, 3, 180, 1695, 1, 576, 7, 1461, 100, 714, 42, 113, 34, 28, 147, 3, 33, 111, 63, 25, 2, 774, 115, 25, 10, 803, 2, 556, 106, 9, 909, 34, 3, 33, 111, 967, 287, 1, 293, 146, 10, 326, 5, 8, 432, 287, 9, 121, 233, 9, 152, 2, 13, 9, 152, 121, 19, 13, 667, 62, 293, 3368, 489, 4, 1067, 7943, 799, 20, 30, 6374, 1317, 8, 142, 287, 1, 293, 146, 360, 197, 27, 1460, 19, 13, 1730, 7, 73, 5, 1057, 121, 415, 4126, 2383, 3071, 42, 8, 280, 287, 1, 293, 146, 269, 105, 339, 19, 13, 713, 114, 45, 1902, 1503, 25, 9, 909, 57, 4, 3, 2366, 1713, 5024, 2145, 262, 3, 3270, 322, 1871, 5, 123, 293, 182, 469, 6594, 1093, 9, 7, 73, 5, 1057, 121, 2471, 712, 44, 93, 152, 121, 2, 1057, 121, 61, 4126, 2383, 3071, 11, 41, 5, 3, 2101, 287, 1, 293, 496, 802, 24, 5091, 68, 401, 293, 182, 9, 3270, 3011]",1474.0,"['local', 'control', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'ha', 'improved', 'modern', 'unclear', 'gain', 'achieved', 'pelvis', 'purpose', 'evaluate', 'local', 'control', 'survival', 'pelvis', 'patient', 'treated', 'modern', 'era', 'pelvis', 'patient', 'diagnosed', 'seen', 'mayo', 'clinic', 'identified', 'factor', 'relevant', 'survival', 'local', 'control', 'cohort', 'consisted', 'patient', 'percent', 'metastatic', 'disease', 'diagnosis', 'year', 'overall', 'survival', 'event', 'free', 'survival', 'wa', 'respectively', 'localized', 'disease', 'year', 'cumulative', 'incidence', 'local', 'recurrence', 'wa', 'incidence', 'radiation', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'local', 'failure', 'occurred', 'field', 'sacral', 'involvement', 'trended', 'higher', 'incidence', 'local', 'recurrence', 'hazard', 'ratio', 'patient', 'treated', 'definitive', 'radiation', 'dos', 'cgy', 'lower', 'incidence', 'local', 'recurrence', 'demonstrates', 'excellent', 'survival', 'localized', 'modern', 'era', 'anatomical', 'localization', 'pelvis', 'likely', 'correlate', 'outcome', 'local', 'control', 'remains', 'problematic', 'especially', 'patient', 'treated', 'definitive', 'radiation', 'statistically', 'significant', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'definitive', 'radiation', 'dose', 'cgy', 'associated', 'lowest', 'incidence', 'local', 'failure', 'suggesting', 'treatment', 'intensification', 'improve', 'local', 'control', 'pelvis']",28244685,26,0.11981566820276497
Sarcomas With CIC-rearrangements Are a Distinct Pathologic Entity With Aggressive Outcome: A Clinicopathologic and Molecular Study of 115 Cases.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2017-07-01,"CIC-DUX4 gene fusion, resulting from either a t(4;19) or t(10;19) translocation, is the most common genetic abnormality detected in EWSR1-negative small blue round cell tumors. Following their discovery it was debated if these tumors should be classified as variants of Ewing sarcoma (ie, atypical Ewing sarcoma) or as a stand-alone pathologic entity. As such the WHO classification temporarily grouped the CIC-rearranged tumors under undifferentiated sarcomas with round cell phenotype, until further clinical evidence was available. However, most studies reported so far include small series with limited follow-up information, which preclude a more definitive assessment. The present work investigates the clinicopathologic features of a large cohort of sarcomas with CIC gene rearrangement, to define their clinical presentation, morphologic spectrum, and outcome. Our study further examines the overall survival of the CIC-positive cohort compared with a control group of EWSR1-rearranged Ewing sarcoma matched for age and stage. The study cohort included 115 patients, with a mean age of 32 years and a slight male predominance. Most tumors occurred in the soft tissue (86%), predominantly deep-seated and equally divided among trunk and extremity, followed by visceral locations (12%) and rarely in the bone (3%). Microscopically, most tumors showed round to ovoid cytomorphology but half of the cases showed also focal areas of spindling and epithelioid/rhabdoid phenotype, with frequent myxoid stromal changes. Variable CD99 reactivity was seen in 84% cases, with a diffuse pattern only in 23% of cases, whereas nuclear WT1 was seen in 92%. A CIC-DUX4 fusion was detected in 57% of cases, with either DUX4 on 4q35 (35%) or on 10q26 in 25 (22%) cases. No FOXO4 gene rearrangements were present in 39 cases tested. Clinical follow-up was available in 57 patients, with a 5-year survival of 43%, which was significantly lower than the 77% 5-year survival in the control Ewing sarcoma group (P=0.002). Our findings show that CIC-DUX4 sarcomas occur most commonly in young adults within the somatic soft tissues, having a wide spectrum of morphology including round, epithelioid and spindle cells, and associated with an aggressive clinical course, with an inferior overall survival compared with Ewing sarcoma. The results support the classification of CIC-rearranged tumors as an independent molecular and clinical subset of small blue round cell tumors distinct from Ewing sarcoma.",Journal

Morbidity and mortality after treatment of Ewing sarcoma: A single-institution experience.,Pediatric blood & cancer,Pediatr Blood Cancer,2017-04-18,"Children, adolescents, and young adults treated for Ewing sarcoma (ES) are at risk for disease-related and treatment-related complications. We aimed to describe early and late overall mortality, cause-specific mortality, and key adverse health outcomes in a large, single-institutional cohort of patients with ES. Patients with ES diagnosed at age less than 40 years and treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering between 1974 and 2012 were included. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards were used to examine the association of clinical and pathologic variables with overall survival. Cause-specific mortality was evaluated with the cumulative incidence function accounting for competing risks. Three hundred patients with ES (60.3% male; median age at diagnosis: 16.8 years [range: 0.3-39]; 30.0% with metastatic disease at diagnosis) were followed for a median of 7.8 years (range: 0.2-37). Five-year overall survival was 65.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 59.8-71.1%) for the entire cohort; 78.6% for those with localized disease; 40.1% for those with isolated pulmonary metastases; and 28.1% for those with extrapulmonary metastases. In multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis, minority race/ethnicity, and metastatic disease at diagnosis were associated with inferior survival. Ten-year cumulative incidence of relapse/progression was 40.1%, with eight late relapses occurring at a median of 6.3 years after diagnosis (range: 5-14). Seventeen patients developed subsequent neoplasms (treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia = 9; solid tumors = 6; nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC] = 4). Excluding NMSC and melanoma in situ, the cumulative incidence of subsequent malignant neoplasms at 25 years was 15% (95% CI, 4.8-25.1%).

Prior to delivery of VDC/IE in adults, 5-year OS was <50%. We reviewed our institutional outcomes for adults with ES who received VDC/IE-based treatment. Between 1997-2013, 67 adults with localized ES were treated with curative intent. Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS were determined using Kaplan-Meier method; comparisons were assessed with log-rank. Proportional hazard models were used to determine predictive factors. All patients received VDC/IE (median 14 cycles.) Local therapy was surgery for 33, radiation therapy for 17, or both for 17. Median follow-up for living patients was 5.2 years. Six patients had disease progression on therapy. Site of first failure was local for three, local and distant for two, and distant for ten. Five-year LRFS was 91%; 5-year LRFS was 96% for nonpelvic disease and 64% for pelvic disease (<i>p</i> = .003). Five-year PFS was 66%, and 5-year OS was 79%. On multivariate analysis, pelvic site had a 3.3 times increased risk of progression (<i>p</i> = .01). Survival for adults with localized ES treated with VDC/IE-based multimodality therapy appears to be better than historical data and similar to excellent outcomes in children.

Advances in the Treatment of Pediatric Bone Sarcomas.,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,2017-01-01,"Bone tumors make up a significant portion of noncentral nervous system solid tumor diagnoses in pediatric oncology patients. Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, both with distinct clinical and pathologic features, are the two most commonly encountered bone cancers in pediatrics. Although mutations in the germline have classically been more associated with osteosarcoma, there is recent evidence germline alterations in patients with Ewing sarcoma also play a significant role in pathogenesis. Treatment advances in this patient population have lagged behind that of other pediatric malignancies, particularly targeted interventions directed at the biologic underpinnings of disease. Recent advances in biologic and genomic understanding of these two cancers has expanded the potential for therapeutic advancement and prevention. In Ewing sarcoma, directed focus on inhibition of EWSR1-FLI1 and its effectors has produced promising results. In osteosarcoma, instead of a concentrated focus on one particular change, largely due to tumor heterogeneity, a more diversified approach has been adopted including investigations of growth factors inhibitors, signaling pathway inhibitors, and immune modulation. Continuing recently made treatment advances relies on clinical trial design and enrollment.

A phase I study of single-agent perifosine for recurrent or refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-05,"The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in various pediatric tumors. We conducted a phase I study of the Akt inhibitor perifosine in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. This was a standard 3+3 open-label dose-escalation study to assess pharmacokinetics, describe toxicities, and identify the MTD for single-agent perifosine. Five dose levels were investigated, ranging from 25 to 125 mg/m2/day for 28 days per cycle. Twenty-three patients (median age 10 years, range 4-18 years) with CNS tumors (DIPG [n = 3], high-grade glioma [n = 5], medulloblastoma [n = 2], ependymoma [n = 3]), neuroblastoma (n = 8), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1) were treated. Only one DLT occurred (grade 4 hyperuricemia at dose level 4). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity at least possibly related to perifosine was neutropenia (8.7%), with the remaining grade 3 or 4 toxicities (fatigue, hyperglycemia, fever, hyperuricemia, and catheter-related infection) occurring in one patient each. Pharmacokinetics was dose-saturable at doses above 50 mg/m2/day with significant inter-patient variability, consistent with findings reported in adult studies. One patient with DIPG (dose level 5) and 4 of 5 patients with high-grade glioma (dose levels 2 and 3) experienced stable disease for two months. Five subjects with neuroblastoma (dose levels 1 through 4) achieved stable disease which was prolonged (≥11 months) in three. No objective responses were noted. In conclusion, the use of perifosine was safe and feasible in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. An MTD was not defined by the 5 dose levels investigated.

EWSR1 fusion proteins mediate PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2017-06-23,"PAX7 is a paired-box transcription factor that is required for the developmental specification of adult skeletal muscle progenitors in mice. We previously demonstrated PAX7 expression as a marker of skeletal muscle differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma. Here, using analyses of published whole-genome gene expression microarray data, we identify PAX7 as a gene with significantly increased expression in Ewing sarcoma in comparison to CIC-DUX4 round cell sarcoma. Analysis of PAX7 in a large cohort of 103 Ewing sarcoma cases by immunohistochemistry revealed expression in 99.0% of cases (102/103). PAX7 expression was noted in cases demonstrating three distinct Ewing sarcoma EWSR1 translocations involving FLI1, ERG, and NFATc2. No PAX7 expression was observed in any of 27 cases of CIC-DUX4 sarcoma by immunohistochemistry (0%; 0/27). Exploring the mechanism of PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma using curated RNA- and ChIP-sequencing data, we demonstrate that the EWSR1 fusion protein is required for PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma and identify a candidate EWSR1-FLI1-bound PAX7 enhancer that coincides with both a consensus GGAA repeat-containing binding site and a peak of regulatory H3K27 acetylation.

A Clinicopathologic Study of Head and Neck Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.,Head and neck pathology,Head Neck Pathol,2017-07-31,"Head and neck high grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (HN-MPNSTs) are rare highly aggressive soft tissue sarcomas that show overlapping morphologic and immunophenotypic features with melanoma and other high grade sarcomas, resulting in diagnostic challenges, particularly in sporadic settings. Recent discoveries have implicated loss of function mutations in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components, including EED or SUZ12 genes, as one of the leading pathogenetic mechanisms in high grade MPNST. MPNSTs with PRC2 loss are associated with complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which emerged as a reliable immunohistochemical marker in the diagnosis of sporadic and radiation induced MPNST. As the diagnosis of MPNST in the HN is particularly challenging to distinguish from melanoma and other sarcoma types, we carried out a clinicopathologic analysis on HN-MPNST patients managed at our institution over a 20-year period (1997-2016), using the latest diagnostic criteria including H3K27me3 staining and other molecular investigations. The overall survival of HN-MPNST was compared with other HN soft tissue sarcomas. The diagnosis of HN-MPNST was confirmed in 13 patients (seven males and six females), with a mean age of 31 years; with 3 (23%) patients being of pediatric age. The most common site was the neck soft tissue (77%). Two-thirds of patients (n = 9) had stigmata of NF1, three had prior radiotherapy and only one developed a de novo MPNST. All except one tumor (86%) tested showed loss of H3K27me3 expression, including all non-NF1 patients. The 2 and 5-year DSS rates were 50 and 30%. The 2-year DFS rate was 21%. Adverse predictors on DSS included adult age (p = 0.011), prior-history of RT (p = 0.003) and recurrence (p = 0.003). Compared to other molecularly confirmed subsets of HN sarcomas (Ewing and Ewing-like sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma), HN-MPNST had the worst overall survival (p < 0.0001). We conclude that HN-MPNSTs are highly aggressive sarcomas associated with an unfavorable outcome and the utility of H3K27me3 IHC stains in the evaluation of MPNST is a reliable ancillary diagnostic

Ewing Sarcoma of the Spine: Prognostic Variables for Survival and Local Control in Surgically Treated Patients.,Spine,Spine,2018-05-01,"Multicenter, ambispective observational study. To quantify mortality and local recurrence after surgical treatment of spinal Ewing sarcoma (ES) and to determine whether an Enneking appropriate procedure and surgical margins (en bloc resection with wide/marginal margins) are associated with improved prognosis. Treatment of primary ES of the spine is complex. Ambiguity remains regarding the role and optimal type of surgery in the treatment of spinal ES. The AOSpine Knowledge Forum Tumor developed a multicenter database including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, mortality, and recurrence rate data for spinal ES. Patients were stratified based on surgical margins and Enneking appropriateness. Survival and recurrence were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Fifty-eight patients diagnosed with primary spinal ES underwent surgery. Enneking appropriateness of surgery was known for 55 patients; 24 (44%) treated Enneking appropriately (EA) and 31 (56%) treated Enneking inappropriately (EI). A statistically significant difference in favor of EA-treated patients was found with regards to survival (P = 0.034). Neoadjuvant and postoperative chemotherapy was significantly associated with increased survival (P = 0.008). Local recurrence occurred in 22% (N = 5) of patients with an EA procedure versus 38% (N = 11) of patients with an EI procedure. The timing of chemotherapy treatment was significantly different between the Enneking cohorts (P < 0.001) and all EA-treated patients received chemotherapy treatment. Although, local recurrence was not significantly different between Enneking cohorts (P = 0.140), intralesional surgical margins and patients who received a previous spine tumor operation were associated with increased local recurrence (P = 0.025 and P = 0.018, respectively).

Identification of Patients With Localized Ewing Sarcoma at Higher Risk for Local Failure: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-08-24,"To identify clinical and treatment variables associated with a higher risk of local failure in Ewing sarcoma patients treated on recent Children's Oncology Group protocols. Data for 956 patients treated with ifosfamide and etoposide-based chemotherapy on INT-0091, INT-0154, and AEWS0031 were analyzed. Local treatment modalities were defined as surgery, definitive radiation therapy (RT), or surgery plus radiation (S+RT). Five-year cumulative incidence of local failure was determined. The local failure rate for the entire cohort was 7.3%, with a 3.9% rate for surgery, 15.3% for RT (P<.01), and 6.6% for S+RT (P=.12). The local failure incidence was 5.4% for extremity tumors, 13.2% for pelvis tumors (P<.01), 5.3% for axial non-spine tumors (P=.90), 9.1% for extraskeletal tumors (P=.08), and 3.6% for spine tumors (P=.49). The incidence of local failure was 14.8% for extremity tumors and 22.4% for pelvis tumors treated with RT, compared with 3.7% for extremity tumors and 3.9% for pelvis tumors treated with surgery (P≤.01). There was no difference in local failure incidence by local treatment modality for axial non-spine, spine, and extraskeletal tumors. The local failure incidence was 11.9% in patients aged ≥18 years versus 6.7% in patients aged <18 years (P=.02). Age ≥18 years (hazard ratio 1.9, P=.04) and treatment with RT (hazard ratio 2.40, P<.01) remained independent prognostic factors for higher local failure incidence on multivariate analysis. Tumor size (</≥ 8 cm) was available in 40% of patients and did not correlate with local failure incidence. Local tumor control is excellent and similar between surgery and RT for axial non-spine, spine, and extraskeletal tumors. Age ≥18 years and use of RT, primarily for pelvis and extremity tumors, are associated with the highest risk of local failure. Further efforts should focus on improving outcomes for these

"Pembrolizumab in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma (SARC028): a multicentre, two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2017-10-04,"Patients with advanced sarcomas have a poor prognosis and few treatment options that improve overall survival. Chemotherapy and targeted therapies offer short-lived disease control. We assessed pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for safety and activity in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma. In this two-cohort, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma from 12 academic centres in the USA that were members of the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC). Patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had to be aged 18 years or older to enrol; patients with bone sarcoma could enrol if they were aged 12 years or older. Patients had histological evidence of metastatic or surgically unresectable locally advanced sarcoma, had received up to three previous lines of systemic anticancer therapy, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1, and had at least one lesion accessible for biopsy. All patients were treated with 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response. Patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab were included in the safety analysis and patients who progressed or reached at least one scan assessment were included in the activity analysis. Accrual is ongoing in some disease cohorts. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02301039. Between March 13, 2015, and Feb 18, 2016, we enrolled 86 patients, 84 of whom received pembrolizumab (42 in each disease cohort) and 80 of whom were evaluable for response (40 in each disease cohort). Median follow-up was 17·8 months (IQR 12·3-19·3). Seven (18%) of 40 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma had an objective response, including four (40%) of ten patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, two (20%) of ten patients with liposarcoma, and one (10%) of ten patients with synovial sarcoma. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an objective response. Two (5%) of 40 patients with bone sarcoma had an objective response, including one (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and one (20%) of five patients with chondrosarcoma. None of the 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma had an objective response. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were anaemia (six [14%]), decreased lymphocyte count (five [12%]), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (four [10%]), and decreased platelet count (three [7%]) in the bone sarcoma group, and anaemia, decreased lymphocyte count, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in the soft-tissue sarcoma group (three [7%] each). Nine (11%) patients (five [12%] in the bone sarcoma group and four [10%] in the soft-tissue sarcoma group) had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), five of whom had immune-related SAEs, including two with adrenal insufficiency, two with pneumonitis, and one with nephritis. The primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort. However, pembrolizumab showed encouraging activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Enrolment to expanded cohorts of those subtypes is ongoing to confirm and characterise the activity of pembrolizumab.

Secondary Acute Leukemia in Sarcoma Patients: A Population-Based Study.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2017-11-14,"To compare rates of secondary acute leukemia between sarcoma patients and the general population, using data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, and to examine whether various patient, tumor, and treatment factors were associated with development of a secondary acute leukemia. Patients with a primary diagnosis of connective tissue malignancy between 1973 and 2008 in the SEER database were included. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with subsequent development of acute leukemia. Using observed-to-expected ratios, we compared incidence rates of secondary acute leukemia between sarcoma patients and the general population. A total of 72,945 patients were identified, with median follow-up of 131 months. On multivariable competing risk analysis, factors associated with increased risk of secondary acute leukemia included receipt of radiation therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, P=.02), distant disease (HR 2.67, P=.004), male gender (HR 1.53, P=.03), year of diagnosis (HR 0.98, P=.049), and Ewing sarcoma histology (HR 9.95, P < .0001) and osteosarcoma histology (HR 5.06, P=.0001). The observed-to-expected ratio for development of a secondary acute leukemia was 3.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95-6.28), 3.41 (95% CI 2.73-4.20), and 1.6 (95% CI 1.38-8.19) for acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute monocytic leukemia, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary acute leukemia for patients who did and did receive radiation therapy was 0.3% versus 0.1% (P=.02). Patients treated for sarcoma, in particular those with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma histology, seem to have a higher incidence of secondary acute leukemia as compared with the general population.

Radiomics Features Differentiate Between Normal and Tumoral High-Fdg Uptake.,Scientific reports,Sci Rep,2018-03-02,"Identification of FDGavid- neoplasms may be obscured by high-uptake normal tissues, thus limiting inferences about the natural history of disease. We introduce a FDG-PET radiomics tissue classifier for differentiating FDGavid- normal tissues from tumor. Thirty-three scans from 15 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and 68 scans from 23 patients with Ewing sarcoma treated on two prospective clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed. Disease volumes were manually segmented on FDG-PET and CT scans. Brain, heart, kidneys and bladder and tumor volumes were automatically segmented on PET images. Standard-uptake-value (SUV) derived shape and first order radiomics features were computed to build a random forest classifier. Manually segmented volumes were compared to automatically segmented tumor volumes. Classifier accuracy for normal tissues was 90%. Classifier performance was varied across normal tissue types (brain, left kidney and bladder, hear and right kidney were 100%, 96%, 97%, 83% and 87% respectively). Automatically segmented tumor volumes showed high concordance with the manually segmented tumor volumes (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97).

EwS data from the Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatology (GPOH) database of the Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Study (CESS) 81/86 and the European Intergroup Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Study EICESS 92 and the EUROpean Ewing tumor Working Initiative of National Groups-99-Protocol (EURO-E.W.I.N.G.-99) study were analyzed. Patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated statistically using chi square tests. The study population included 2,635 patients with bone EwS. Sites of primary and metastatic tumors differed according to the age groups of young children (0-9 years), early adolescence (10-14 years), late adolescence (15-19 years), young adults (20-24 years), and adults (more than 24 years). Young children demonstrated the most striking differences in site of disease with a lower proportion of pelvic primary and axial tumors. They presented less often with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Site of primary and metastatic tumor involvement in EwS differs according to patient age.

Multimodality Treatment of Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor: Chemotherapy and Complete Cytoreductive Surgery Improve Patient Survival.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-06-05,"<b>Purpose:</b> Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), which harbors EWSR1-WT1 t(11;22)(p13:q12) chromosomal translocation, is an aggressive malignancy that typically presents as intra-abdominal sarcomatosis in young males. Given its rarity, optimal treatment has not been defined.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We conducted a retrospective study of 187 patients with DSRCT treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center over 2 decades. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. We determined whether chemotherapy, complete cytoreductive surgery (CCS), hyperthermic intraperitoneal cisplatin (HIPEC), and/or whole abdominal radiation (WART) improve overall survival (OS) in patients with DSRCT. Critically, because our institutional practice limits HIPEC and WART to patients with less extensive, potentially resectable disease that had benefited from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a time-variant analysis was performed to evaluate those adjunct treatment modalities.<b>Results:</b> The pre-2003 5-year OS rate of 5% has substantially improved to 25% with the advent of newer chemotherapies and better surgical and radiotherapy techniques (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.75). Chemotherapy response (log rank <i>P</i> = 0.004) and CCS (log rank <i>P</i> < 0.0001) were associated with improved survival. Although WART and HIPEC lacked statistical significance, our study was not powered to detect their potential impact upon OS.<b>Conclusions:</b> Improved 3- and 5-year OS were observed following multidisciplinary treatment that includes Ewing sarcoma (ES)-based chemotherapy and complete tumor cytoreductive surgery, but few if any patients are cured. Prospective randomized studies will be required to prove whether HIPEC or WART are important. In the meantime, chemotherapy and CCS remain the cornerstone of treatment and provide a solid foundation to evaluate new biologically targeted therapies. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(19); 4865-73. ©2018

Growing Role of Regorafenib in the Treatment of Patients with Sarcoma.,Targeted oncology,Target Oncol,2018-08-01,"Sarcomas encompass a group of rare solid tumors responsible for approximately 1% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States each year. Subtypes include, but are not limited to, soft tissue sarcomas (STS) such as leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, pleomorphic sarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Treatment options for patients with STS vary depending on, among other factors, histological subtype. Data from a mix of phase 2 and phase 3 trials have suggested that the orally available multikinase inhibitor regorafenib may have efficacy in patients with STS who have progressed on previous lines of systemic therapy. Some clinical benefit of regorafenib has been shown in patients with leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, GIST, Ewing's sarcoma, and other sarcoma subtypes, suggesting a broad spectrum of potential activity in this population.

Phys.,2018-08-02,"Treatment strategies in palliation of pediatric cancer remain a significant challenge. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) for metastatic or recurrent childhood tumors. A total of 104 lesions in 62 pediatric patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer were treated with a short hypofractionation schedule (>1 but ≤5 fractions; ≥3 Gy per fraction) between 2007 and 2017 in our institution. The primary endpoint was local control (LC). Other endpoints included treatment response, overall survival, progression-free survival, and toxicity. Toxicities were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0. The most common histologies were neuroblastoma, comprising 50 of the 104 lesions (48.1%); osteosarcoma, 17 lesions (16.4%); and Ewing sarcoma, 13 lesions (12.5%). A median total dose of 24 Gy was delivered in a median of 5 fractions. Of 104 lesions, 26 (25.0%) were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy, 24 (23.1%) with intensity modulated RT, and 48 (46.2%) with 2-dimensional RT or 3-dimensional conformal RT. A complete or partial response was observed in 63 (60.6%) of lesions, and stable disease was observed in 34 (32.7%). At a median follow-up of 8.7 months, 21 local failures occurred (20.2%). The 1- and 2-year LC rates were 74% and 68%, respectively. LC was better for tumors without previous irradiation (83% vs 57% with previous RT; P = .004). LC rates did not differ between RT techniques or total biologically effective dose with α/β ratio of 10 (BED10) (≤30 vs >30 Gy). At the time of analysis, 38 deaths in the cohort of 62 patients (61.3%) were recorded. The 1-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 31% and 44%, respectively. Incidence of any grade ≥3 toxicity was 6.7% (7 of 104). No grade 5 events occurred.

Genome-wide association study identifies multiple new loci associated with Ewing sarcoma susceptibility.,Nature communications,Nat Commun,2018-08-09,"Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer characterized by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. We performed a genome-wide association study of 733 EWS cases and 1346 unaffected individuals of European ancestry.

"Abemaciclib Is Active in Preclinical Models of Ewing Sarcoma via Multipronged Regulation of Cell Cycle, DNA Methylation, and Interferon Pathway Signaling.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2018-08-21,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and highly malignant cancer that occurs in the bone and surrounding tissue of children and adolescents. The <i>EWS/ETS</i> fusion transcription factor that drives ES pathobiology was previously demonstrated to modulate cyclin D1 expression. In this study, we evaluated abemaciclib, a small-molecule CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4 and 6) inhibitor currently under clinical investigation in pediatric solid tumors, in preclinical models of ES. Using Western blot, high-content imaging, flow cytometry, ELISA, RNA sequencing, and CpG methylation assays, we characterized the <i>in vitro</i> response of ES cell lines to abemaciclib. We then evaluated abemaciclib <i>in vivo</i> in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models of ES as either a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Abemaciclib induced quiescence in ES cell lines via a G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle block, characterized by decreased proliferation and reduction of Ki-67 and FOXM1 expression and retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation. In addition, abemaciclib reduced DNMT1 expression and promoted an inflammatory immune response as measured by cytokine secretion, antigen presentation, and interferon pathway upregulation. Single-agent abemaciclib reduced ES tumor volume in preclinical mouse models and, when given in combination with doxorubicin or temozolomide plus irinotecan, durable disease control was observed. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the antitumor effects of abemaciclib in preclinical ES models are multifaceted and include cell-cycle inhibition, DNA demethylation, and immunogenic changes.",Journal Article,518.0,4.0,ES is a rare and highly malignant cancer that occurs in the and surrounding tissue of children and adolescents The i EWS/ETS /i fusion transcription factor that drives ES pathobiology was previously demonstrated to modulate cyclin D1 expression In this study we evaluated abemaciclib a small-molecule CDK4 and CDK6 CDK4 and 6 inhibitor currently under clinical investigation in pediatric solid tumors in preclinical models of ES Using Western blot high-content imaging flow cytometry ELISA RNA sequencing and CpG methylation assays we characterized the i in vitro /i response of ES cell lines to abemaciclib We then evaluated abemaciclib i in vivo /i in cell line-derived xenograft CDX and patient-derived xenograft PDX mouse models of ES as either a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy Abemaciclib induced quiescence in ES cell lines via a G sub 1 /sub cell-cycle block characterized by decreased proliferation and reduction of Ki-67 and FOXM1 expression and protein RB phosphorylation In addition abemaciclib reduced DNMT1 expression and promoted an inflammatory immune response as measured by cytokine secretion antigen presentation and interferon pathway upregulation Single-agent abemaciclib reduced ES tumor volume in preclinical mouse models and when given in combination with doxorubicin or temozolomide plus irinotecan durable disease control was observed Collectively our data demonstrate that the antitumor effects of abemaciclib in preclinical ES models are multifaceted and include cell-cycle inhibition DNA demethylation and immunogenic changes,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3011, 16, 8, 622, 2, 561, 393, 12, 17, 1780, 4, 3, 2, 2976, 246, 1, 541, 2, 3101, 3, 70, 4528, 4802, 70, 1212, 866, 161, 17, 5267, 3011, 8465, 10, 373, 264, 6, 3319, 1226, 2146, 55, 4, 26, 45, 21, 194, 10140, 8, 302, 1354, 3254, 2, 9518, 3254, 2, 49, 230, 694, 669, 38, 940, 4, 815, 537, 57, 4, 693, 274, 1, 3011, 75, 1521, 2639, 64, 2457, 270, 1412, 1914, 3664, 893, 615, 2, 2075, 569, 1013, 21, 765, 3, 70, 4, 439, 70, 51, 1, 3011, 31, 285, 6, 10140, 21, 818, 194, 10140, 70, 4, 386, 70, 4, 31, 328, 526, 1330, 12417, 2, 69, 526, 1330, 3250, 830, 274, 1, 3011, 22, 361, 8, 1411, 15, 4, 150, 5, 56, 10140, 277, 13957, 4, 3011, 31, 285, 847, 8, 499, 551, 14, 551, 31, 417, 2381, 765, 20, 340, 457, 2, 628, 1, 2311, 598, 2, 7899, 55, 2, 178, 2955, 982, 4, 352, 10140, 405, 7328, 55, 2, 2992, 35, 1291, 250, 51, 22, 644, 20, 1675, 2935, 448, 1031, 2, 1688, 308, 2218, 226, 420, 10140, 405, 3011, 30, 433, 4, 693, 830, 274, 2, 198, 447, 4, 150, 5, 856, 15, 1537, 349, 1071, 1480, 34, 182, 10, 164, 2535, 114, 74, 608, 17, 3, 579, 176, 1, 10140, 4, 693, 3011, 274, 32, 10076, 2, 643, 31, 417, 297, 261, 6800, 2, 4190, 400]",1570.0,"['ewing', 'sarcoma', 'rare', 'highly', 'malignant', 'occurs', 'bone', 'surrounding', 'tissue', 'child', 'adolescent', 'ew', 'ets', 'fusion', 'transcription', 'factor', 'drive', 'pathobiology', 'wa', 'previously', 'demonstrated', 'modulate', 'cyclin', 'expression', 'evaluated', 'abemaciclib', 'small', 'molecule', 'cdk', 'cdk', 'cdk', 'inhibitor', 'currently', 'clinical', 'investigation', 'pediatric', 'solid', 'preclinical', 'model', 'western', 'blot', 'high', 'content', 'imaging', 'flow', 'cytometry', 'elisa', 'rna', 'sequencing', 'cpg', 'methylation', 'characterized', 'vitro', 'response', 'line', 'abemaciclib', 'evaluated', 'abemaciclib', 'vivo', 'line', 'derived', 'xenograft', 'cdx', 'patient', 'derived', 'xenograft', 'pdx', 'mouse', 'model', 'monotherapy', 'combination', 'chemotherapy', 'abemaciclib', 'induced', 'quiescence', 'line', 'sub', 'sub', 'cycle', 'block', 'characterized', 'decreased', 'proliferation', 'reduction', 'ki', 'foxm', 'expression', 'retinoblastoma', 'rb', 'phosphorylation', 'addition', 'abemaciclib', 'reduced', 'dnmt', 'expression', 'promoted', 'inflammatory', 'immune', 'response', 'measured', 'cytokine', 'secretion', 'antigen', 'presentation', 'interferon', 'pathway', 'upregulation', 'single', 'agent', 'abemaciclib', 'reduced', 'volume', 'preclinical', 'mouse', 'model', 'given', 'combination', 'doxorubicin', 'temozolomide', 'plus', 'irinotecan', 'durable', 'disease', 'control', 'wa', 'observed', 'collectively', 'demonstrate', 'antitumor', 'effect', 'abemaciclib', 'preclinical', 'model', 'multifaceted', 'include', 'cycle', 'inhibition', 'dna', 'demethylation', 'immunogenic', 'change']",30131386,38,0.17511520737327188
Detection of circulating tumour DNA is associated with inferior outcomes in Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,British journal of cancer,Br. J. Cancer,2018-08-21,"New prognostic markers are needed to identify patients with Ewing sarcoma (EWS) and osteosarcoma unlikely to benefit from standard therapy. We describe the incidence and association with outcome of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays. A NGS hybrid capture assay and an ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing assay were used to detect ctDNA in banked plasma from patients with EWS and osteosarcoma, respectively. Patients were coded as positive or negative for ctDNA and tested for association with clinical features and outcome. The analytic cohort included 94 patients with EWS (82% from initial diagnosis) and 72 patients with primary localised osteosarcoma (100% from initial diagnosis). ctDNA was detectable in 53% and 57% of newly diagnosed patients with EWS and osteosarcoma, respectively. Among patients with newly diagnosed localised EWS, detectable ctDNA was associated with inferior 3-year event-free survival (48.6% vs. 82.1%; p = 0.006) and overall survival (79.8% vs. 92.6%; p = 0.01).

Characteristics and Predictors for Secondary Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome in Ewing and Osteosarcoma Survivors.,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.,2018-08-28,"Long-term survivors of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma may be at risk for therapy-related acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AL/MDS). We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 1071 patients with osteosarcoma (n = 757) and ES (n = 314) who were treated between 1985 and 2014. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to analyze predictors of t-AL/MDS, including a radiation dose (≥55.8 Gy vs <55.8 Gy) × disease site (pelvis/spine vs other) interaction term. A supplemental nested case-control study was conducted to assess the association between cumulative chemotherapy dose and t-AL/MDS. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 97 months (range, 0.03-380). Twenty patients developed t-AL/MDS, all of whom received chemotherapy and 15 of whom were treated with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to ≥55.8 Gy was associated with development of t-AL/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-6.80; P = .015), and there was a significant radiation dose × disease site interaction term (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.71-16.53; P<sub>interaction</sub> < .001).

Assessing the feasibility and validity of the Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines: a population-based registry study.,The Lancet.

However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma.

Extraskeletal versus Skeletal Ewing Sarcoma in the adult population: Controversies in care.,Surgical oncology,Surg Oncol,2018-05-24,"A lack of consensus exists on the prognosis of extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES) relative to its skeletal (ES) counterpart in adults. This study sought to characterize outcome differences between the two diagnoses. From 2004 to 2014, the NCDB identified 2,660 Ewing Sarcoma patients. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for overall survival (OS). EES patients were older, more likely to be female, and have smaller tumors. Among patients with ES, 4.0% received no treatment, 2.5% received local therapy only (surgery and/or radiation), 16.8% received chemotherapy only, while 52.2% received combination therapy (local and chemotherapy), and 17.0% recieived triple therapy (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy). Among patients with EES, 4.3% recived no treatment, 5.6% received local therapy only, 15.6% received chemotherapy only, while 47.0% received combination therapy, and 21.6% received triple therapy. No difference in OS was observed between the two groups (P = 0.816). Factors independently associated with OS for ES included age (HR = 1.26, P = 0.01), Charlson-Deyo Score (CDS) ≥2 (HR = 3.66, P < 0.001), combination therapy (HR = 0.39, P < 0.001) and triple therapy (HR = 0.34, P < 0.001). For EES, factors for OS were age (HR = 1.52, P < 0.001), CDS ≥2 (HR = 1.90, P = 0.02), combination therapy (HR = 0.44, P < 0.001), triple therapy (HR = 0.34, P < 0.001) and PNET histology (HR = 1.33, P = 0.02).

The intra-abdominal tumors affected female patients, 31-and 53-year old. Both tumors showed sheets and nests of round to spindle cells, fine chromatin, tiny conspicuous nucleoli, moderate cytoplasm, and thick bands of intratumoral fibrosis. On immunohistochemistry, both tumors showed positivity for CD99, desmin, myogenin, MyoD1, S100, Sox10, CD34, and GFAP and were negative for keratin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed rearrangement at EWSR1 locus. Next-generation sequencing-based RNA fusion assay revealed EWSR1-PATZ1 fusion in both cases.

Risk stratification by somatic mutation burden in Ewing sarcoma.,Cancer,Cancer,2019-01-02,"Up to one-third of patients with localized Ewing sarcoma (ES) develop recurrent disease, but current biomarkers do not accurately identify this high-risk group. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the utility of mutational burden in predicting outcomes in patients with localized ES. Clinical and genomic data from 99 patients with ES, of whom 63 had localized disease at diagnosis, were obtained from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Genomic data included the type and number of somatic mutations using cBioPortal mutation calling. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the time to progression (TTP). Patients had a median number of 11 somatic mutations. Patients were stratified according to whether they had a lower or higher mutational burden if they had ≤11 or >11 mutations, respectively. Higher mutational burden was significantly associated with inferior OS and TTP, a finding that was confirmed by univariate and multivariable analyses. In patients who had localized disease at diagnosis, higher mutational burden was the only variable significantly associated with inferior OS and TTP. The presence of a mutation in either stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or tumor protein 53 (TP53), both of which were correlated previously with shorter OS in patients with ES, were significantly associated with higher mutational burden. Upon stratifying patients who had localized disease based on a standard panel of cancer genes, higher risk stratification was correlated significantly with inferior TTP and trended toward significance with inferior OS. Patients who have localized ES and a higher mutational burden have inferior OS and TTP compared with those who have lower mutation burden. The current findings suggest that the somatic mutation burden can be used to better risk stratify these patients and to guide clinical decision making.",Journal Article,384.0,5.0,Up to one-third of patients with localized ES develop recurrent disease but current biomarkers do not accurately identify this high-risk group Therefore the objective of this study was to determine the utility of mutational burden in predicting outcomes in patients with localized ES Clinical and genomic data from 99 patients with ES of whom 63 had localized disease at diagnosis were obtained from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics Genomic data included the type and number of somatic mutations using cBioPortal mutation calling Primary endpoints were overall survival OS and the time to progression TTP Patients had a median number of 11 somatic mutations Patients were stratified according to whether they had a lower or higher mutational burden if they had ≤11 or 11 mutations respectively Higher mutational burden was significantly associated with inferior OS and TTP a finding that was confirmed by univariate and multivariable analyses In patients who had localized disease at diagnosis higher mutational burden was the only variable significantly associated with inferior OS and TTP The presence of a mutation in either stromal antigen 2 STAG2 or tumor protein 53 TP53 both of which were correlated previously with shorter OS in patients with ES were significantly associated with higher mutational burden Upon stratifying patients who had localized disease based on a standard panel of cancer genes higher risk stratification was correlated significantly with inferior TTP and trended toward significance with inferior OS Patients who have localized ES and a higher mutational burden have inferior OS and TTP compared with those who have lower mutation burden The current findings suggest that the somatic mutation burden can be used to better risk stratify these patients and to guide clinical decision making,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[126, 6, 104, 1282, 1, 7, 5, 909, 3011, 690, 387, 34, 84, 291, 582, 1022, 44, 2141, 255, 26, 64, 43, 87, 673, 3, 461, 1, 26, 45, 10, 6, 223, 3, 1207, 1, 1619, 892, 4, 1434, 123, 4, 7, 5, 909, 3011, 38, 2, 572, 74, 29, 1058, 7, 5, 3011, 1, 953, 676, 42, 909, 34, 28, 147, 11, 683, 29, 3, 27506, 9, 12, 4229, 572, 74, 159, 3, 267, 2, 207, 1, 1119, 138, 75, 27506, 258, 14558, 86, 1387, 11, 63, 25, 118, 2, 3, 98, 6, 91, 2422, 7, 42, 8, 52, 207, 1, 175, 1119, 138, 7, 11, 1173, 768, 6, 317, 491, 42, 8, 280, 15, 142, 1619, 892, 492, 491, 42, 32288, 15, 175, 138, 106, 142, 1619, 892, 10, 97, 41, 5, 1663, 118, 2, 2422, 8, 1567, 17, 10, 557, 20, 880, 2, 658, 318, 4, 7, 54, 42, 909, 34, 28, 147, 142, 1619, 892, 10, 3, 158, 1347, 97, 41, 5, 1663, 118, 2, 2422, 3, 463, 1, 8, 258, 4, 361, 1126, 448, 18, 15439, 15, 30, 178, 699, 1206, 110, 1, 92, 11, 438, 373, 5, 985, 118, 4, 7, 5, 3011, 11, 97, 41, 5, 142, 1619, 892, 1548, 5035, 7, 54, 42, 909, 34, 90, 23, 8, 260, 993, 1, 12, 214, 142, 43, 1541, 10, 438, 97, 5, 1663, 2422, 2, 6374, 1317, 724, 5, 1663, 118, 7, 54, 47, 909, 3011, 2, 8, 142, 1619, 892, 47, 1663, 118, 2, 2422, 72, 5, 135, 54, 47, 280, 258, 892, 3, 291, 272, 309, 17, 3, 1119, 258, 892, 122, 40, 95, 6, 380, 43, 3570, 46, 7, 2, 6, 1597, 38, 948, 1079]",1821.0,"['patient', 'localized', 'ewing', 'sarcoma', 'develop', 'recurrent', 'disease', 'current', 'biomarkers', 'accurately', 'identify', 'high', 'risk', 'group', 'objective', 'wa', 'determine', 'utility', 'burden', 'predicting', 'outcome', 'patient', 'localized', 'clinical', 'genomic', 'patient', 'localized', 'disease', 'diagnosis', 'obtained', 'cbioportal', 'genomics', 'genomic', 'included', 'type', 'number', 'somatic', 'cbioportal', 'calling', 'primary', 'endpoint', 'overall', 'survival', 'time', 'progression', 'ttp', 'patient', 'median', 'number', 'somatic', 'patient', 'stratified', 'according', 'lower', 'higher', 'burden', 'respectively', 'higher', 'burden', 'wa', 'significantly', 'associated', 'inferior', 'ttp', 'finding', 'wa', 'confirmed', 'univariate', 'multivariable', 'patient', 'localized', 'disease', 'diagnosis', 'higher', 'burden', 'wa', 'variable', 'significantly', 'associated', 'inferior', 'ttp', 'presence', 'stromal', 'antigen', 'stag', 'tp', 'correlated', 'previously', 'shorter', 'patient', 'significantly', 'associated', 'higher', 'burden', 'stratifying', 'patient', 'localized', 'disease', 'based', 'standard', 'panel', 'higher', 'risk', 'stratification', 'wa', 'correlated', 'significantly', 'inferior', 'ttp', 'trended', 'significance', 'inferior', 'patient', 'localized', 'higher', 'burden', 'inferior', 'ttp', 'compared', 'lower', 'burden', 'current', 'finding', 'suggest', 'somatic', 'burden', 'better', 'risk', 'stratify', 'patient', 'guide', 'clinical', 'decision', 'making']",30602061,3,0.013824884792626729
