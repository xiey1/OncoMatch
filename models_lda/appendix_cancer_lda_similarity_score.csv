American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on the use of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: status report 2002.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2002-08-01,"To conduct an evidence-based technology assessment to determine whether the routine use of anastrozole or any of the aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant breast cancer setting is appropriate for broad-based conventional use in clinical practice. POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS: Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. Outcomes of interest include breast cancer incidence, breast cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and net health benefit. A comprehensive, formal literature review was conducted for relevant topics and is detailed in the text. Testimony was collected from invited experts and interested parties. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)-prescribed technology assessment procedure was followed. BENEFITS/HARMS: The ASCO panel recognizes that a woman and her physician's decision regarding adjuvant hormonal therapy is complex and will depend on the importance and weight attributed to information regarding both cancer and non-cancer-related risks and benefits. The panel was influenced by the compelling, extensive, and long-term data available on tamoxifen. Overall, the panel considers the results of the Arimidex (anastrozole) or Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial and the extensive supporting data to be very promising but insufficient to change the standard practice at this time (May 2002). A 5-year course of adjuvant tamoxifen remains the standard therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The panel recommends that physicians discuss the available information with patients, and, in making a decision, acknowledge that treatment approaches can change over time. Individual health care providers and their patients will need to come to their own conclusions, with careful consideration of all of the available data. (Specific questions addressed by the panel are summarized in Appendix 3.) The conclusions of the panel were endorsed by the ASCO Health Services Research Committee and the ASCO Board of Directors.",Journal Article,6382.0,215.0,To conduct an evidence-based technology

Anderson Cancer Center and Texas Children's Hospital were searched for cases of carcinoid tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma arising at extra-appendiceal sites in children. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections and, when available, immunohistochemistry, electron photomicrographs and gross photographs were reviewed. The tumors were classified as either carcinoid tumor or neuroendocrine carcinoma based upon histopathologic features. Demographic information was obtained from review of the surgical pathology reports, autopsy reports, and clinical charts. The study population included 8 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 8 to 18 years. The majority of the cases were classified as carcinoid tumors (8/13), with the remainder being neuroendocrine carcinomas (5/13). The lung was the initial site of presentation in most children (6/13). The liver was the next most common site (5/13) of tumor presentation with no other primary site identified. Neuroendocrine carcinoma within an inguinal lymph node, with no primary tumor site identified, was present in a single case. The final case was a neuroendocrine carcinoma with widespread involvement of multiple organs with no definitive primary site identified.

Whole-genome allelotyping identified distinct loss-of-heterozygosity patterns in mucinous ovarian and appendiceal carcinomas.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2005-11-01,"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary is one of the common histologic types of ovarian cancer. Its pathogenesis is largely unknown. In addition, the differential diagnosis of metastatic mucinous carcinomas to the ovaries, particularly those originating from the appendix, remains challenging. The purpose of this study is to identify molecular biomarkers for mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma and compare them with those of appendiceal origin. Genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was done on DNA isolated from 28 microdissected primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and five appendiceal adenocarcinomas. Markers from high-loss regions were selected for further analysis on a total of 32 ovarian and 14 appendiceal cancers. High levels of LOH rates (>40%) were detected on chromosome arms 9p, 17p, and 21q in mucinous ovarian carcinoma cases. The frequency of allelic loss was similar between high-grade and low-grade mucinous ovarian carcinoma cases but was significantly higher in ovarian versus appendiceal cases. In addition, LOH rates on five chromosomal loci were statistically different between ovarian and appendiceal carcinomas. A high frequency of LOH can be found in mucinous ovarian adenocarcinomas independent of grade.

VEGF expression predicts survival in patients with peritoneal surface metastases from mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix and colon.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2007-11-28,"High levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ovarian cancer metastases are associated with a worse prognosis in patients treated with chemotherapy. VEGF-directed therapy improves survival for those with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients with mucinous adenocarcinomas metastatic to the peritoneal surfaces can be treated with cytoreductive surgery, and both tumor grade and cytoreduction status are prognostic. We hypothesized that angiogenic indices may be prognostic in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix and colon. Cytoreductive cases from a 5-year period from the University of Cincinnati peritoneal malignancy database were reviewed. CD 34 counts (blood vessels) and VEGF expression was evaluated by means of immunohistochemistry on specimens from patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) for mucinous adenocarcinoma. A total of 26 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 50 years, underwent cytoreductive surgery and IPHP for mucinous adenocarcinoma of appendiceal (n = 32) or colonic (n = 3) origin. With a mean follow-up of 18 months (range 1-63 months), 23 had disease recurrence and 12 were alive without recurrence. The mean survival was 19 months (range 1-63 months). CD34 counts did not correlate with recurrence or survival; however, average VEGF counts correlated with survival (P = 0.017), and, for patients with recurrence, this correlation was stronger (P = 0.002). These results suggest that markers of tumor angiogenesis may predict survival in patients with peritoneal surface metastases from mucinous adenocarcinoma.

Is there a difference in survival between right- versus left-sided colon cancers?,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2008-07-12,"The incidence of right-sided colon cancers has been increasing in recent years. It is unclear whether patient prognosis varies by tumor location. In this study, we have compared the survival of right-and left-sided colon cancers in a longitudinal population-based database. A retrospective survival analysis was performed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database between 1988 and 2003 on subjects who underwent surgical resection for the a primary diagnosis of pathologically confirmed invasive colon adenocarcinoma. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess long-term survival outcomes comparing right-sided (cecum to transverse colon, excluding appendix) versus left-sided (splenic flexure to sigmoid, excluding rectum) colon cancers. A total of 77,978 subjects were identified with adenocarcinoma of the colon. Overall median survival was 83 months. Median survival for right-sided cancers was 78 vs. 89 months for left-sided cancers (P < .001). By Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, controlling for statistically significant confounders, including age, sex, race, marital status, tumor stage, tumor size, histologic grade, number of lymph nodes examined, and year of diagnosis, right-sided colon cancers were associated with a 5% increased mortality risk compared with left-sided colon cancers (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07). These findings were consistent across subsets of subjects. On the basis of analysis of information from the SEER database, we found that right-sided colon cancers have a worse prognosis than left-sided colon cancers. The reason for this remains unclear but may be due to biological and/or environmental factors and may have particular bearing, given the rising incidence of right-sided colon cancers.",Comparative Study,4210.0,252.0,"The incidence of right-sided cancers has been increasing in recent years It is unclear whether patient prognosis varies by tumor location In this study we have compared the survival of right-and left-sided cancers in a longitudinal population-based database A retrospective survival analysis was performed using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program SEER database between 1988 and 2003 on subjects who underwent surgical resection for the a primary diagnosis of pathologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess long-term survival outcomes comparing right-sided cecum to transverse excluding versus left-sided splenic flexure to sigmoid excluding rectum cancers A total of 77,978 subjects were identified with adenocarcinoma of the Overall median survival was 83 months Median survival for right-sided cancers was 78 vs. 89 months for left-sided cancers P .001 By Cox proportional hazard regression analysis controlling for statistically significant confounders including age sex race marital status tumor stage tumor size histologic grade number of lymph nodes examined and year of diagnosis right-sided cancers were associated with a 5 increased mortality risk compared with left-sided cancers hazard ratio 1.04 95 confidence interval 1.02-1.07 These findings were consistent across subsets of subjects On the basis of analysis of information from the SEER database we found that right-sided cancers have a worse prognosis than left-sided cancers The reason for this remains unclear but may be due to biological and/or environmental factors and may have particular bearing given the rising incidence of right-sided cancers",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[3, 287, 1, 1913, 1689, 163, 71, 85, 602, 4, 435, 60, 192, 16, 1200, 317, 69, 356, 4037, 20, 30, 1147, 4, 26, 45, 21, 47, 72, 3, 25, 1, 1913, 2, 1712, 1689, 163, 4, 8, 2380, 266, 90, 609, 8, 459, 25, 65, 10, 173, 75, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1243, 1605, 609, 59, 3314, 2, 1522, 23, 976, 54, 208, 221, 170, 9, 3, 8, 86, 147, 1, 2998, 557, 416, 449, 418, 831, 360, 320, 65, 10, 95, 6, 423, 319, 337, 25, 123, 1430, 1913, 1689, 16000, 6, 8575, 3207, 185, 1712, 1689, 5237, 15997, 6, 9356, 3207, 3660, 163, 8, 181, 1, 849, 14270, 976, 11, 108, 5, 449, 1, 3, 63, 52, 25, 10, 852, 53, 52, 25, 9, 1913, 1689, 163, 10, 833, 105, 887, 53, 9, 1712, 1689, 163, 19, 144, 20, 418, 831, 360, 320, 65, 1893, 9, 712, 93, 4423, 141, 89, 1035, 1047, 5345, 156, 30, 82, 30, 444, 884, 88, 207, 1, 263, 502, 409, 2, 111, 1, 147, 1913, 1689, 163, 11, 41, 5, 8, 33, 101, 282, 43, 72, 5, 1712, 1689, 163, 360, 197, 14, 755, 48, 307, 268, 14, 588, 14, 1615, 46, 272, 11, 925, 716, 1890, 1, 976, 23, 3, 877, 1, 65, 1, 487, 29, 3, 1605, 609, 21, 204, 17, 1913, 1689, 163, 47, 8, 639, 356, 76, 1712, 1689, 163, 3, 3852, 9, 26, 469, 1200, 84, 68, 40, 520, 6, 1037, 2, 15, 3766, 130, 2, 68, 47, 1454, 1894, 447, 3, 3699, 287, 1, 1913, 1689, 163]",1702.0,"['incidence', 'right', 'sided', 'colon', 'ha', 'increasing', 'recent', 'year', 'unclear', 'patient', 'prognosis', 'varies', 'location', 'compared', 'survival', 'right', 'left', 'sided', 'colon', 'longitudinal', 'population', 'based', 'database', 'retrospective', 'survival', 'wa', 'performed', 'surveillance', 'epidemiology', 'end', 'program', 'seer', 'database', 'subject', 'underwent', 'surgical', 'resection', 'primary', 'diagnosis', 'pathologically', 'confirmed', 'invasive', 'colon', 'adenocarcinoma', 'cox', 'proportional', 'hazard', 'regression', 'wa', 'ass', 'long', 'term', 'survival', 'outcome', 'comparing', 'right', 'sided', 'cecum', 'transverse', 'colon', 'excluding', 'appendix', 'versus', 'left', 'sided', 'splenic', 'flexure', 'sigmoid', 'excluding', 'rectum', 'colon', 'total', 'subject', 'identified', 'adenocarcinoma', 'colon', 'overall', 'median', 'survival', 'wa', 'month', 'median', 'survival', 'right', 'sided', 'wa', 'month', 'left', 'sided', 'cox', 'proportional', 'hazard', 'regression', 'controlling', 'statistically', 'significant', 'confounders', 'including', 'age', 'sex', 'race', 'marital', 'status', 'stage', 'size', 'histologic', 'grade', 'number', 'lymph', 'node', 'examined', 'year', 'diagnosis', 'right', 'sided', 'colon', 'associated', 'increased', 'mortality', 'risk', 'compared', 'left', 'sided', 'colon', 'hazard', 'ratio', 'confidence', 'interval', 'finding', 'consistent', 'subset', 'subject', 'basis', 'information', 'seer', 'database', 'right', 'sided', 'colon', 'worse', 'prognosis', 'left', 'sided', 'colon', 'reason', 'remains', 'unclear', 'environmental', 'factor', 'particular', 'bearing', 'given', 'rising', 'incidence', 'right', 'sided', 'colon']",18622647,0,0.0
Feasibility and safety of outpatient brachytherapy in 37 patients with brain tumors using the GliaSite Radiation Therapy System.,Medical physics,Med Phys,2008-07-01,"Temporary, low dose rate brachytherapy to the margins of resected brain tumors, using a balloon catheter system (GliaSite Radiation Therapy System) and liquid I-125 radiation source (Iotrex), began in 2002 at the University of Arizona Medical Center. Initially, all patients were treated on an inpatient basis. For patient convenience, we converted to outpatient therapy. In this article we review the exposure data and safety history for the 37 patients treated as outpatients. Proper patient selection and instruction is crucial to having a successful outpatient brachytherapy program. A set of evaluation criteria and patient instructions were developed in compliance with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's document NUREG-1556 Volume 9 (Appendix U) and Arizona State Nuclear regulatory guidelines, which specify acceptable exposure rates for outpatient release in this setting. Of the 37 patients monitored, 26 patients were treated for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), six for primary GBM, and five for metastatic brain tumors. All 37 patients and their primary caregivers gave signed agreement to follow a specific set of instructions and were released for the duration of brachytherapy (3-7 days). The typical prescription dose was 60 Gy delivered at 0.5 cm from the balloon surface. Afterloaded activities in these patients ranged from 90.9 to 750.0 mCi and measured exposure rates at 1 m from the head were less than 14 mR/h.

Appendiceal carcinoma: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.,Postgraduate medicine,Postgrad Med,2008-11-01,"Appendiceal carcinoma is a very rare clinical entity, constituting 1% of all colorectal malignancies and 1% of all appendectomy specimens. Appendiceal malignancies often present atypically, thus creating diagnostic challenges. We present a patient with mucinous carcinoma of the appendix who presented with hematuria and abdominal pain. Similar case reports are extremely rare in the literature, while typical presentations of appendiceal carcinoma include abdominal pain, abdominal mass, early satiety, nausea, and iron-deficiency anemia. Initially, the diagnostic investigation in our patient was focused on urinary tract disorders, but ultimately resulted in finding a mucinous appendiceal carcinoma. The carcinoma had invaded the urinary bladder and was disseminated in the peritoneal cavity. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery is the most common therapeutic approach for disseminated tumors, often followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy. However, treatment should be individualized based on patient-specific parameters, such as the presence of comorbidities, performance status, as well as the presence of metastatic disease. Our patient had optimal cytoreduction with subsequent systemic therapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor.

Similar to NETs in general, the diagnosed incidence of the midgut NETs is on the rise. Their presenting symptoms vary depending on stage and primary site. Local-regional NETs often present with vague and nonspecific symptoms. Classic carcinoid syndrome is more likely to appear in patients with advanced disease. Local-regional NETs of the small bowel should be resected whenever possible. With the exception of small well-differentiated NETs of the appendix, NETs of the midgut have substantial risk of relapse after resection and need to be followed for at least 7 years.Metastatic/advanced NETs of the midgut are incurable. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Somatostatin analogs are effective in the management of carcinoid syndrome. Octreotide long-acting release has also recently been shown to delay disease progression. Liver-directed therapy and surgical debulking can improve quality of life in selected patients.

Appendiceal pathology at the time of oophorectomy for ovarian neoplasms.,Obstetrics and gynecology,Obstet Gynecol,2010-12-01,"To investigate the prevalence of appendiceal pathology in women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian neoplasm and the predictive value of intraoperative findings to determine the need for appendectomy at the time of surgery. Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent oophorectomy and appendectomy during the same surgical procedures at the University of Virginia Health System from 1992 to 2007. Observations were stratified based on the nature (benign, borderline, or malignant) and histology (serous compared with mucinous) of the ovarian neoplasm, frozen compared with final pathological diagnosis, and the gross appearance of the appendix. Among the 191 patients identified, frozen section was consistent with seven mucinous and 35 serous carcinomas, 16 serous and 33 mucinous borderline tumors, 71 mucinous and serous cystadenomas, and 29 cases of suspected metastatic tumor from a gastrointestinal primary. The highest rates of coexisting appendiceal pathology were associated with serous ovarian cancers (94.4% of grossly abnormal and 35.3% of normal appendices) and ovarian tumors suspected to be of primary gastrointestinal origin (83.3% grossly abnormal and 60.0% normal appendices harbored coexisting mucinous neoplasms). Linear regression analysis revealed that appearance of the appendix and frozen section diagnosis of the ovarian pathology were statistically significant predictors of coexisting appendiceal pathology, but the latter was more important. The prevalence of coexisting, clinically significant appendiceal pathology is low with a frozen section diagnosis of serous or mucinous cystadenoma.

On Bayesian methods of exploring qualitative interactions for targeted treatment.,Statistics in medicine,Stat Med,2012-06-26,"Providing personalized treatments designed to maximize benefits and minimizing harms is of tremendous current medical interest. One problem in this area is the evaluation of the interaction between the treatment and other predictor variables. Treatment effects in subgroups having the same direction but different magnitudes are called quantitative interactions, whereas those having opposite directions in subgroups are called qualitative interactions (QIs). Identifying QIs is challenging because they are rare and usually unknown among many potential biomarkers. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis reduces the power of hypothesis testing and multiple subgroup analyses inflate the type I error rate. We propose a new Bayesian approach to search for QI in a multiple regression setting with adaptive decision rules. We consider various regression models for the outcome. We illustrate this method in two examples of phase III clinical trials. The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement using existing software packages.

Varying malignant potential of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors: importance of histologic subtype.,Journal of surgical oncology,J Surg Oncol,2012-07-05,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the appendix include malignant carcinoid tumor (MCT), goblet cell carcinoid (GCT), and composite goblet cell carcinoid-adenocarcinoma (CGCC-A). We compared characteristics and outcomes of these histologic subtypes. Patients with appendiceal NETs were identified from the National Cancer Database (1998-2007). Descriptive statistics were used to compare cohorts and associations between clinicopathologic factors and overall survival (OS) were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 2,812 patients with appendiceal NETs were identified. The most common histologic subtype was GCT (59.6%), followed by MCT (32.1%), CGCC-A (6.9%), and others (1.4%). CGCC-A had a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastases (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-4.8) and distant metastases (OR, 6.0; 95% CI = 3.8-9.3) than GCT. The 5-year OS was 86.3% (95% CI, 81.4-89.9) for MCT, 77.6% (95% CI, 74.0-80.8) for GCT, and 56.3% (95% CI, 42.1-68.4) for CGCC-A (P < 0.0001). Appendiceal NETs represent a spectrum of disease with varying malignant potential: MCT (low), GCT (intermediate), and CGCC-A (high).

Improving the AJCC/TNM staging for adenocarcinomas of the appendix: the prognostic impact of histological grade.,Annals of surgery,Ann. Surg.,2013-06-01,"Though histological grade is known to have a major prognostic impact in metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas, the prognostic impact of grade in localized disease, and the validity of the American Joint Committee on Cancer AJCC Staging Manual 7th edition's decision to combine moderately and poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas into a single mucinous high-grade category, is not known. Patients with adenocarcinoma of the appendix diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 were identified from the SEER database. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) stratified by histological subtype, stage, and grade was calculated, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed. We analyzed a total of 2469 appendiceal adenocarcinomas, of which 1375 had mucinous histology and 860 had nonmucinous histology. Though overall CSS was similar for mucinous and nonmucinous subtypes, differences in stage distribution and stage-stratified CSS were seen. Female sex, stage IV disease, and well-differentiated histology were more common for mucinous adenocarcinomas. Histological grade had a strong prognostic impact, especially in patients with stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma. The adjusted hazard ratios for stage IV moderately and poorly differentiated histological grade were 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.34] and 4.94 (95% CI: 3.32-7.35) for mucinous histology, in comparison with 1.44 (95% CI: 0.82-2.52) and 1.90 (95% CI: 0.95-3.80) for nonmucinous histology, respectively. The strong prognostic impact of histological grade for mucinous adenocarcinomas is primarily restricted to stage IV disease.

Patients with MCTs were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Patients undergoing surgery were compared to unresected patients. Surgery was performed in 33% of patients.

High-level microsatellite instability in appendiceal carcinomas.,The American journal of surgical pathology,Am. J. Surg. Pathol.,2013-08-01,"High-level microsatellite instability (MSI-high) is found in approximately 15% of all colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRCs) and in at least 20% of right-sided cancers. It is most commonly due to somatic hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter region, with familial cases (Lynch syndrome) representing only 2% to 3% of CRCs overall. In contrast to CRC, MSI-high in appendiceal adenocarcinomas is rare. Only 4 MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas and 1 MSI-high appendiceal serrated adenoma have been previously reported, and the prevalence of MSI in the appendix is unknown. We identified 108 appendiceal carcinomas from MD Anderson Cancer Center in which MSI status had been assessed by immunohistochemistry for the DNA mismatch-repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (n=83), polymerase chain reaction (n=7), or both (n=18). Three cases (2.8%) were MSI-high, and 1 was MSI-low. The 3 MSI-high cases included: (1) a poorly differentiated nonmucinous adenocarcinoma with loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression, lack of MLH1 promoter methylation, and lack of BRAF gene mutation, but no detected germline mutation in MLH1 from a 39-year-old man; (2) an undifferentiated carcinoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6, but no detected germline mutation in MSH2 or TACSTD1, from a 59-year-old woman; and (3) a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in a villous adenoma with loss of MSH2/MSH6 expression, in a 38-year-old man with a strong family history of CRC who declined germline testing. When the overall group of appendiceal carcinomas was classified according to histologic features and precursor lesions, the frequencies of MSI-high were: 3 of 108 (2.8%) invasive carcinomas, 3 of 96 (3.1%) invasive carcinomas that did not arise from a background of goblet cell carcinoid tumors, and 0 of 12 (0%) signet ring and mucinous carcinomas arising in goblet cell carcinoid tumors. These findings, in conjunction with the previously reported MSI-high appendiceal carcinomas, highlight the low prevalence of MSI in the appendix as compared with the right colon and suggest that MLH1 promoter methylation is not a mechanism for MSI in this location.

Analysis of 320 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors identifies TS expression as independent biomarker for survival.,International journal of cancer,Int. J. Cancer,2014-01-06,"Thymidylate synthase (TS), a critical enzyme for DNA synthesis and repair, is both a potential tumor prognostic biomarker as well as a tumorigenic oncogene in animal models. We have now studied the clinical implications of TS expression in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and compared these results to other cell cycle biomarker genes. Protein tissue arrays were used to study TS, Ki-67, Rb, pRb, E2F1, p18, p21, p27 and menin expression in 320 human GEP-NETs samples. Immunohistochemical expression was correlated with univariate and multivariate predictors of survival utilizing Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Real time RT-PCR was used to validate these findings. We found that 78 of 320 GEP-NETs (24.4%) expressed TS. NETs arising in the colon, stomach and pancreas showed the highest expression of TS (47.4%, 42.6% and 37.3%, respectively), whereas NETs of the appendix, rectum and duodenum displayed low TS expression (3.3%, 12.9% and 15.4%, respectively). TS expression in GEP-NETs was associated with poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma, angiolymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). Patients with TS-positive NETs had markedly worse outcomes than TS-negative NETs as shown by univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.01) survival analyses. Expression of p18 predicted survival in TS-positive patients that received chemotherapy (p = 0.015). In conclusion, TS protein expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for GEP-NETs.

Laparoscopic evacuation of mucinous ascites for palliation of pseudomyxoma peritonei.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2014-11-14,"Accumulation of mucinous ascites causes significant morbidity for patients with unresectable pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). The success of paracentesis for mucin evacuation is limited due to the presence of adhesions, disease burden, and the viscous nature of mucinous ascites. We sought to review our experience with laparoscopic evacuation of mucinous ascites for palliation of PMP. Records were reviewed for patients who underwent laparoscopy for carcinomatosis secondary to appendix or colon cancer from July 2007 to January 2014. Of 123 patients, 10 were identified who underwent 17 laparoscopic procedures for palliative evacuation of mucinous ascites. All patients had primary appendiceal cancers and all presented with symptomatic ascites causing abdominal distension and bloating. Pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle or 5-mm optical viewing trocar in the majority of cases (n = 11). In the remaining six cases, an open technique was used and a 10-mm Hasson trocar was placed. There were no trocar-related complications. The median volume of mucin evacuated was 2.0 liters (range 1.7-8.0). All procedures were done as same-day surgeries; no patients required hospitalization. All patients reported symptomatic improvement following the procedure.

This study sought to characterize predictors of outcome among patients treated for stages 1-3 appendix cancer at the authors' institution. Patients with nonmetastatic appendix cancer undergoing definitive surgery at a single cancer center from 1994 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with appendiceal adenomas, cystadenomas, or classical carcinoids were excluded from the study. The median follow-up period was 5.2 years (interquartile range 2.9-6.7 years). The study identified 70 patients, 49 % of whom were women. The median age was 52 years (range 20-84 years). All were explored by an expert surgeon who had treated at least 20 appendiceal cancers. The procedures were appendectomy (n = 2), right hemicolectomy (n = 66), and diagnostic laparoscopy and placement of an intraperitoneal port (n = 2). The final pathology showed that transmural (30 T4, 32 T3, 4 T2, 4 T1) and node-negative disease (80 %) were common. Goblet cell carcinoid (GCC) features were identified in 54 % of the tumors. These were smaller and more likely to present as acute appendicitis than appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA), but were otherwise similar in clinical presentation and outcome. The presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than of stage 2 appendix cancer (78 vs. 4 % at 5 years; p < 0.0001).

A Simplified Preoperative Assessment Predicts Complete Cytoreduction and Outcomes in Patients with Low-Grade Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Appendix.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-02-20,"Complete cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) has been shown to improve survival in patients with low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma (LGMA). However, incomplete cytoreduction exposes patients to significant morbidity without a similar survival benefit. Preoperative assessment of the ability to achieve CRS is therefore a critical step in selecting patients for CRS/HIPEC. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a preoperative scoring system to accurately predict the ability to achieve complete cytoreduction in patients with LGMA of the appendix. A simplified preoperative assessment for appendix tumor (SPAAT) score was developed based on computed tomography scan findings thought to predict incomplete cytoreduction. We applied the SPAAT score to patients with LGMA to determine the ability of the score to predict complete cytoreduction. This scoring system was then applied to a separate cohort of patients from a different institution. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for the SPAAT score. Survival was calculated and correlated with the SPAAT score and the completeness of cytoreduction score. A SPAAT score of <3 is a significant predictor of complete cytoreduction in the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort, 40 of 42 patients with a SPAAT score <3 achieved a complete cytoreduction, for a positive predictive value of 95.2 % and a negative predictive value of 100 %.

"The impact of stage, grade, and mucinous histology on the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in adenocarcinomas of the appendix: Analysis of the National Cancer Data Base.",Cancer,Cancer,2015-10-27,"Adenocarcinomas of the appendix represent a heterogeneous disease depending on the presence of mucinous histology, histologic grade, and stage. In the current study, the authors sought to explore the interplay of these factors with systemic chemotherapy in a large population data set. Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) who were diagnosed with mucinous, nonmucinous, and signet ring cell-type appendiceal neoplasms from 1985 through 2006 were selected. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed. A total of 11,871 patients met the inclusion criteria for the current study: 50.3% had mucinous neoplasms, 40.5% had nonmucinous neoplasms, and 9.2% had signet ring cell-type neoplasms. The 5-year overall survival (OS) stratified by grade was similar among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to stage III disease but not for those with stage IV disease. The median OS for patients with stage IV mucinous and nonmucinous tumors was 6.4 years and 2.3 years, respectively, for those with well differentiated histology (P<.0001) and was 1.5 years and 0.8 years, respectively, for those with poorly differentiated histology (P<.0001). In multivariable modeling for stage I to III disease, adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS for both mucinous and nonmucinous histologies, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.68-0.89 [P = .0002]) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94 [P = .002]), respectively. For patients with stage IV disease, systemic chemotherapy significantly improved OS for those with nonmucinous (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82 [P<.0001]) but not mucinous (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86-1.04 [P = .2) histologies, although this was grade-dependent. The median OS for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 6.4 years versus 6.5 years (P value not significant) for patients with mucinous, well-differentiated tumors and 1.6 years versus 1.0 years (P = .0007) for patients with mucinous, poorly differentiated tumors. Adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a significant OS benefit regardless of histology. However, for patients with stage IV disease, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy varied by tumor histology and grade, with patients with well-differentiated, mucinous, appendiceal adenocarcinomas deriving no survival benefit from systemic chemotherapy.

A Novel Tool for Predicting Major Complications After Cytoreductive Surgery with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2015-12-17,"Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) has an emerging role in the treatment of peritoneal malignancies. The CRS-HIPEC approach has known treatment-related toxicities. This study sought to determine the predictors of major postoperative complications after CRS-HIPEC in a high-volume center. From a single-institution database, this study investigated complications experienced by patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC. Multiple preoperative and operative factors were analyzed for their ability to predict 60-day Clavien grade 3 and greater (major) complications by logistic regression. A predictive model was created from preoperative factors using multivariate logistic regression. The model was tested by Akaike's information criterion, the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test, the receiver operating characteristic, and the Youden Index. The study evaluated 247 patients undergoing CRS-HIPEC. The primary tumor site was the appendix in 166 cases (67.2 %), the colorectal area in 51 cases (20.6 %), the peritoneum (mesothelioma) in 22 cases (8.9 %), the ovary in 5 cases (2 %), and the small bowel in 3 cases (1.2 %). The median peritoneal cancer index was 14 (range 0-29), and 235 patients (95.1 %) had a complete (CC-0/1) cytoreduction. Major complications occurred for 41 patients (16.6 %), classified as grade 3 in 33 cases (13.4 %), grade 4 in 5 cases (2 %), and grade 5 (deaths) in 3 cases (1.2 %). The factors predictive of major complications in the multivariate analysis were a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score higher than 0 [odds ratio (OR), 2.505; p = 0.035], presence of preoperative symptoms (OR 1.951; p = 0.064), and prior resection status [no resection or prior CRS-HIPEC (OR 2.087) vs. prior resection without CRS-HIPEC (OR 3.209); p = 0.046].

"Nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 012): results of an open-label, phase 1, multicohort study.",The Lancet. Oncology,Lancet Oncol.,2016-12-05,"Nivolumab has shown improved survival in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with chemotherapy. We assessed the safety and activity of combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first-line therapy for NSCLC. The open-label, phase 1, multicohort study (CheckMate 012) cohorts reported here were enrolled at eight US academic centres. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent stage IIIb or stage IV, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Data from the latter two cohorts, which were considered potentially suitable for further clinical development, are presented in this report; data from the other cohort (as well as several earlier cohorts) are described in the appendix. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, assessed in all treated patients. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01454102. Between May 15, 2014, and March 25, 2015, 78 patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 12 weeks (n=38) or nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 6 weeks (n=40). One patient in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort was excluded before treatment; therefore 77 patients actually received treatment (38 in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort; 39 in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort). At data cut-off on Jan 7, 2016, 29 (76%) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 32 (82%) in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort had discontinued treatment. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (37%) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 13 (33%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort; the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased lipase (three [8%] and no patients), pneumonitis (two [5%] and one [3%] patients), adrenal insufficiency (one [3%] and two [5%] patients), and colitis (one [3%] and two [5%] patients). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 12 (32%) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 11 (28%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort. Treatment-related adverse events (any grade) prompted treatment discontinuation in four (11%) patients in the every-12-weeks cohort and five (13%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Confirmed objective responses were achieved in 18 (47% [95% CI 31-64]) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 15 (38% [95% CI 23-55]) patients in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort; median duration of response was not reached in either cohort, with median follow-up times of 12·8 months (IQR 9·3-15·5) in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 11·8 months (6·7-15·9) in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort. In patients with PD-L1 of 1% or greater, confirmed objective responses were achieved in 12 (57%) of 21 patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 13 (57%) of 23 patients in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort. In NSCLC, first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab had a tolerable safety profile and showed encouraging clinical activity characterised by a high response rate and durable response. To our knowledge, the results of this study are the first suggestion of improved benefit compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in patients with NSCLC, supporting further assessment of this combination in a phase 3 study.

Overinterpretation is common in pathological diagnosis of appendix cancer during patient referral for oncologic care.,PloS one,PLoS ONE,2017-06-07,"Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) and appendiceal adenocarcinoma are known to cause the majority of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP, i.e. mucinous ascites); however, recognition and proper classification of these neoplasms can be difficult despite established diagnostic criteria. To determine the pathological diagnostic concordance for appendix neoplasia and related lesions during patient referral to an academic medical center specialized in treating patients with PMP. The anatomic pathology laboratory information system was searched to identify cases over a two-year period containing appendix specimens with mucinous neoplasia evaluated by an outside pathology group and by in-house slide review at a single large academic medical center during patient referral. 161 cases containing appendix specimens were identified over this period. Forty-six of 161 cases (28.6%) contained appendiceal primary neoplasia or lesions. Of these, the originating pathologist diagnosed 23 cases (50%) as adenocarcinoma and 23 cases (50%) as LAMN; however, the reference pathologist diagnosed 29 cases (63.0%) as LAMN, 13 cases (28.3%) as adenocarcinoma, and 4 cases (8.7%) as ruptured simple mucocele. Importantly, for cases in which the originating pathologist rendered a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, the reference pathologist rendered a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (56.5%, 13 of 23), LAMN (39.1%, 9 of 23), or simple mucocele (4.3%, 1 of 23). The overall diagnostic concordance rate for these major classifications was 71.7% (33 of 46) with an unweighted observed kappa value of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.27-0.69), consistent with moderate interobserver agreement. All of the observed discordance (28.3%) for major classifications could be attributed to over-interpretation. In addition, the majority of LAMN cases (65.5%) had potential diagnostic deficiencies including over-interpretation as adenocarcinoma and lacking or discordant risk stratification (i.e. documentation of extra-appendiceal neoplastic epithelium). Appendiceal mucinous lesions remain a difficult area for appropriate pathological classification with substantial discordance due to over-interpretation in this study. The findings highlight the critical need for recognition and application of diagnostic criteria regarding these tumors.

Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for Moderately and Poorly Differentiated Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma: Survival Outcomes and Patient Selection.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2017-07-10,"Moderately and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the appendix represents an aggressive histological variant with a high risk of recurrence and death. Overall, 178 patients with moderately and poorly differentiated appendiceal adenocarcinoma were identified from a prospective database. Clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors were analyzed for outcomes. Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) identified radiographic occult peritoneal metastasis in 25 (42%) patients. These patients had a significantly lower peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) and improved overall survival (OS) compared with those with radiographic disease. Twenty-seven (41%) patients were excluded from cytoreductive surgery (CRS) because of findings on DL, while 116 (65%) patients underwent CRS and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), with a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 23 months. Mucinous histology (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, p = 0.04) and PCI (HR 1.054, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of DFS. The median OS following CRS and HIPEC was 48 months.

Impact of Synchronous Liver Resection on the Perioperative Outcomes of Patients Undergoing CRS-HIPEC.,Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,J. Gastrointest. Surg.,2018-04-30,"While liver resection (LR) and cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are commonly performed for hepatic and peritoneal metastases, respectively, the safety of synchronous LR and CRS-HIPEC has not been established. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) databases from 2005 to 2016 were used to identify patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC. Demographic, clinical, and perioperative outcomes were compared among patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC with and without synchronous LR. Among 1168 patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC, 100 (8.6%) underwent synchronous LR and 1068 (91.4%) did not. The most common primary diagnosis was unspecified (65.3%) followed by appendix (16.0%) and colorectal (12.5%). Among patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC plus LR, the majority had a partial hepatectomy (96.0%), while a small subset underwent trisegmentectomy (2.0%) or hemihepatectomy (2.0%). Patients who underwent CRS-HIPEC plus LR underwent a greater number of operative procedures (8.3 ± 2.5 vs 6.7 ± 2.5, p < 0.001), had a longer operative time (520.7 ± 155.3 vs 454.6 ± 160.7 min, p = 0.001), had a longer hospital length of stay (16.7 ± 15.6 vs 11.1 ± 11.5 days, p < 0.001), were more likely to require reoperation (13.0 vs 6.9%, p = 0.03), and experienced greater 30-day morbidity (47.0 vs 27.4%, p < 0.001), but not mortality (3.0 vs 1.4%, p = 0.22). On multivariate logistic regression, LR was strongly associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity even after controlling for potential confounders (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.64). Simultaneous LR and CRS-HIPEC was associated with increased operative time, length of hospital stay, reoperation, and postoperative morbidity compared to CRS-HIPEC alone.

Preoperative Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis is an Independent Predictor of Progression-Free Survival.,Annals of surgical oncology,Ann. Surg. Oncol.,2018-06-14,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a useful tool for detecting genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To date, most ctDNA tests have been performed on patients with widely metastatic disease. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (metastases) present unique prognostic and therapeutic challenges. We therefore explored preoperative ctDNA in patients with peritoneal metastases undergoing surgery. Patients referred for surgical resection of peritoneal metastases underwent preoperative blood-derived ctDNA analysis (clinical-grade NGS [68-73 genes]). ctDNA was quantified as the percentage of altered circulating cell-free DNA (% cfDNA). Eighty patients had ctDNA testing: 46 (57.5%) women; median age 55.5 years. The following diagnoses were included: 59 patients (73.8%), appendix cancer; 11 (13.8%), colorectal; five (6.3%), peritoneal mesothelioma; two (2.5%), small bowel; one (1.3%) each of cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian, and testicular cancer. Thirty-one patients (38.8%) had detectable preoperative ctDNA alterations, most frequently in the following genes: TP53 (25.8% of all alterations detected) and KRAS (11.3%). Among 15 patients with tissue DNA NGS, 33.3% also had ctDNA alterations (overall concordance = 96.7%). Patients with high ctDNA quantities (≥ 0.25% cfDNA, n = 25) had a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with lower ctDNA quantities (n = 55; 7.8 vs. 15.0 months; hazard ratio 3.23, 95% confidence interval 1.43-7.28, p = 0.005 univariate, p = 0.044 multivariate).

Trends in Outcomes After Cytoreductive Surgery With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.,The Journal of surgical research,J. Surg. Res.,2018-10-12,"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and cytoreductive surgery (CRS) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes among select patients presenting with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The aim of the present study was to describe temporal trends in clinical outcomes among patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC. Patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases from 2005 to 2013. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. A total of 889 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. The most common primary tumor sites were the peritoneum (59.8%), followed by the appendix (13.7%) and colon (6.4%). The median operative time for all patients was 438 min (interquartile range: 328-550); postoperative morbidity was 41.3%, and 2.0% of patients died within 30 d of surgery. Over the time evaluated, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the median operative time (2005 versus 2013, 600 versus 403 min), postoperative morbidity (50.0% versus 36.1%), and length of stay (13.5 versus 8 d; all P < 0.05).

Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder of Appendix Mimicking Acute Appendicitis: A Case Report.,Transplantation proceedings,Transplant. Proc.,2019-07-29,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) can be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoproliferations occurring in the first year after transplantation or EBV-negative lymphoma occurring many years after transplantation. Both B-cell and T-cell type of PTLD are described in the literature. In the gastrointestinal tract, the small and large intestine are the common sites of involvement. PTLD of the appendix is a lesser-known entity and cases described previously presented clinically as acute appendicitis.
