Treatment of late-stage Sézary syndrome with 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine.,International journal of dermatology,Int. J. Dermatol.,2002-06-01,"2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), a purine adenosine analog, is safe and effective chemotherapy for patients with hairy cell leukemia and low-grade lymphomas. Adverse effects include neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and infectious complications. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2-CdA (2-6 seven-day cycles) in the treatment of late-stage, recalcitrant Sézary syndrome. Retrospective review of medical records of six patients with Sézary syndrome who had received 2-CdA cycles at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between March 1995 and March 2000. Variables assessed from the records included improvement in global appearance, extent of erythroderma, size of lymph nodes, pruritus, and leukocyte, lymphocyte, and absolute Sézary cell counts. Two patients, both with stage III Sézary syndrome, whose previous treatment consisted of only two modalities, responded well to the treatment, with moderate to total clearing of erythroderma and pruritus associated with a significant decrease in Sézary cell counts. The other four patients had only a partial response (one patient) or no response (three patients) to 2-CdA. The mortality rate was 50%. All three patients died of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. However, only one patient was receiving 2-CdA treatment when he died. The other two patients died 8 and 9 weeks after the last 2-CdA cycle. This high mortality rate is attributed to infectious complications after 2-CdA treatment in patients with recalcitrant disease. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine shows efficacy in stage III Sézary syndrome, but it also carries a substantial risk of septic complications and mortality. It can be used if no other suitable alternatives are available. Caution should be exercised in all these patients regarding skin care and avoidance of infections or sepsis.",Journal Article,6443.0,18.0,2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine 2-CdA a purine adenosine analog is safe and effective chemotherapy for patients with hairy cell and low-grade lymphomas Adverse effects include neutropenia lymphocytopenia and infectious complications Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of 2-CdA 2-6 seven-day cycles in the treatment of late-stage recalcitrant Sézary syndrome Retrospective review of medical records of six patients with Sézary syndrome who had received 2-CdA cycles at Mayo Clinic Rochester between March 1995 and March 2000 Variables assessed from the records included improvement in global appearance extent of erythroderma size of lymph nodes pruritus and leukocyte lymphocyte and absolute Sézary cell counts Two patients both with stage III Sézary syndrome whose previous treatment consisted of only two modalities responded well to the treatment with moderate to total clearing of erythroderma and pruritus associated with a significant decrease in Sézary cell counts The other four patients had only a partial response one patient or no response three patients to 2-CdA The mortality rate was 50 All three patients died of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis However only one patient was receiving 2-CdA treatment when he died The other two patients died 8 and 9 weeks after the last 2-CdA cycle This high mortality rate is attributed to infectious complications after 2-CdA treatment in patients with recalcitrant disease 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine shows efficacy in stage III Sézary syndrome but it also carries a substantial risk of septic complications and mortality It can be used if no other suitable alternatives are available Caution should be exercised in all these patients regarding care and avoidance of infections or sepsis,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[18, 23121, 18, 8174, 8, 5006, 4938, 3497, 16, 1165, 2, 323, 56, 9, 7, 5, 7152, 31, 2, 154, 88, 1557, 290, 176, 643, 778, 18790, 2, 3398, 521, 114, 461, 10, 6, 376, 3, 209, 1, 18, 8174, 18, 49, 648, 218, 410, 4, 3, 24, 1, 807, 82, 20201, 9939, 681, 459, 206, 1, 484, 1064, 1, 437, 7, 5, 9939, 681, 54, 42, 103, 18, 8174, 410, 28, 2486, 1188, 5801, 59, 2363, 2323, 2, 2363, 1081, 682, 275, 29, 3, 1064, 159, 767, 4, 1648, 3592, 1039, 1, 21999, 444, 1, 263, 502, 6858, 2, 3627, 1448, 2, 1766, 9939, 31, 1911, 100, 7, 110, 5, 82, 316, 9939, 681, 1310, 698, 24, 1695, 1, 158, 100, 1558, 2211, 149, 6, 3, 24, 5, 1163, 6, 181, 17090, 1, 21999, 2, 6858, 41, 5, 8, 93, 775, 4, 9939, 31, 1911, 3, 127, 294, 7, 42, 158, 8, 450, 51, 104, 69, 15, 77, 51, 169, 7, 6, 18, 8174, 3, 282, 116, 10, 212, 62, 169, 7, 1016, 1, 14739, 14772, 4227, 137, 158, 104, 69, 10, 357, 18, 8174, 24, 198, 3174, 1016, 3, 127, 100, 7, 1016, 66, 2, 83, 244, 50, 3, 1060, 18, 8174, 417, 26, 64, 282, 116, 16, 3073, 6, 3398, 521, 50, 18, 8174, 24, 4, 7, 5, 20201, 34, 18, 23121, 1949, 209, 4, 82, 316, 9939, 681, 84, 192, 120, 4942, 8, 1281, 43, 1, 12526, 521, 2, 282, 192, 122, 40, 95, 492, 77, 127, 2884, 6295, 32, 390, 5526, 257, 40, 15865, 4, 62, 46, 7, 666, 165, 2, 5863, 1, 1875, 15, 4227]",1729.0,"['cda', 'purine', 'adenosine', 'analog', 'safe', 'effective', 'chemotherapy', 'patient', 'hairy', 'leukemia', 'low', 'grade', 'lymphoma', 'adverse', 'effect', 'include', 'neutropenia', 'lymphocytopenia', 'infectious', 'complication', 'objective', 'wa', 'evaluate', 'efficacy', 'cda', 'seven', 'day', 'cycle', 'treatment', 'late', 'stage', 'recalcitrant', 'sézary', 'syndrome', 'retrospective', 'review', 'medical', 'record', 'patient', 'sézary', 'syndrome', 'received', 'cda', 'cycle', 'mayo', 'clinic', 'rochester', 'march', 'march', 'variable', 'assessed', 'record', 'included', 'improvement', 'global', 'appearance', 'extent', 'erythroderma', 'size', 'lymph', 'node', 'pruritus', 'leukocyte', 'lymphocyte', 'absolute', 'sézary', 'count', 'patient', 'stage', 'iii', 'sézary', 'syndrome', 'previous', 'treatment', 'consisted', 'modality', 'responded', 'treatment', 'moderate', 'total', 'clearing', 'erythroderma', 'pruritus', 'associated', 'significant', 'decrease', 'sézary', 'count', 'patient', 'partial', 'response', 'patient', 'response', 'patient', 'cda', 'mortality', 'rate', 'wa', 'patient', 'died', 'staphylococcus', 'aureus', 'sepsis', 'patient', 'wa', 'receiving', 'cda', 'treatment', 'died', 'patient', 'died', 'week', 'cda', 'cycle', 'high', 'mortality', 'rate', 'attributed', 'infectious', 'complication', 'cda', 'treatment', 'patient', 'recalcitrant', 'disease', 'efficacy', 'stage', 'iii', 'sézary', 'syndrome', 'carry', 'substantial', 'risk', 'septic', 'complication', 'mortality', 'suitable', 'alternative', 'available', 'caution', 'exercised', 'patient', 'skin', 'care', 'avoidance', 'infection', 'sepsis']",12100691,3,0.05555555555555555
Recombinant human soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (p75) fusion protein Enbrel in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies.,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,Cancer Chemother.

We conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of the soluble TNF receptor, etanercept (p75 TNFR:Fc; Enbrel) in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Patients were eligible if they had refractory HCL, CLL, AMM, or Philadelphia-negative MPD. Enbrel was administered twice weekly at a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously for a minimum of eight doses, and was continued in patients without overt progression. Among the 26 patients enrolled on study, 25 patients were evaluable. Nine patients had AMM, eight CLL, three HCL, and five Philadelphia-negative MPD. Their median age was 60 years (range 30-83 years). A total of 70 courses consisting of 486 doses of Enbrel were administered. Enbrel was well tolerated, without any overt increase in infectious episodes. Stable disease/no objective response was seen in 22 patients (88%) and progression in 3 patients (12%). Three patients with AMM improved (two showed hematologic improvement, and one showed a reduction in liver and spleen size), and two patients (one with CLL and one with Philadelphia-negative MPD) showed improvement in disease-related symptoms.

Pentostatin in the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2003-03-01,"Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; Nipent), a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, is a purine nucleoside analogue that is highly effective in the treatment of hairy-cell leukemia. This agent is capable of inducing durable complete remissions in the majority of patients, and is capable of re-inducing a complete remission in many of the patients who have relapsed. Pentostatin appears to have changed the natural history of this disease. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that patients with hairy-cell leukemia who are induced into complete remission have a projected survival comparable to age-matched controls. While purine nucleoside analogues induce profound T-cell dysfunction and longstanding immunosuppression, the incidence of secondary malignancies is apparently not increased.

Simultaneous manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL).,American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2004-02-01,"We report a unique case of 83-year-old Caucasian male with the initial simultaneous manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The patient presented with absolute lymphocytosis in the blood, asymptomatic generalized lymphadenopathy, and mild splenomegaly. The diagnosis of CLL was suggested from the blood film, but subsequent flow cytometric (FC) analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) revealed two distinct abnormal clones of mature B cells. A small subpopulation (7%) of lymphoid cells expressed CD20, CD11c, FMC-7, CD103, CD25, and kappa surface light chain, consistent with HCL. The larger subpopulation (75%) of lymphoid cells expressed CD19, CD20, CD23, CD5, and lambda light chain, consistent with CLL. The expression of different immunoglobulin light chains on the circulating CLL (lambda) and HCL (kappa) cells suggested two, independent, malignant B-cell clones. Interestingly, FC analysis of bone marrow (BM) cells done 6 months later revealed bright lambda light chain expression on the HCL cells. Despite administration of several different courses of chemotherapy, the HCL subpopulation was not eliminated from the BM but remained stable between 7% and 10% of total BM lymphoid cells.

Treatment of hairy cell leukemia with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA): long-term follow-up of the Northwestern University experience.,Blood,Blood,2005-03-10,"2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA), a purine analog, has become universally accepted as the agent of choice in treating hairy cell leukemia (HCL). However, few studies have reported long-term outcomes after 2-CdA treatment. Between January 1990 and June 2003, 86 consecutive patients with HCL were treated with a single 7-day course of 2-CdA by continuous infusion at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day. Of the 86 patients (mean age: 49 years), 67 patients (79%) achieved a complete remission (CR); 18 patients (21%) achieved a partial remission (PR); and 1 patient's response was unable to be assessed. The progression-free survival (PFS) for initial relapse after 12 years was 54%. At a median follow-up of 9.7 years (range, 0.3-13.8 years), 31 (36%) of 85 patients relapsed. There were 23 relapsed patients treated with a second cycle of 2-CdA; 2 patients were treated with alternative agents; and 6 patients were observed.

Purine analogue combinations for indolent lymphomas.,Seminars in hematology,Semin. Hematol.,2006-04-01,"Indolent lymphomas are a group of lymphoid malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment. The progress in treating patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) using nucleoside analogues can be used as a model for other indolent B-lymphoproliferative disorders, such as follicular lymphoma. Recent advancements in therapeutic options available for these patients include combination therapy with agents that have differing mechanisms of action and non-overlapping toxicity.

Heterogeneous CD52 expression among hematologic neoplasms: implications for the use of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H).,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,Clin. Cancer Res.,2006-12-01,"CD52 is a GPI-linked glycoprotein expressed by B cells, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. The humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) is specific for CD52 and is Food and Drug Administration - approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The utility of CAMPATH in the treatment of other hematologic neoplasms has been explored; however, a comprehensive survey of CD52 expression among a broad spectrum of WHO-defined tumor types has not been completed. We evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms for the presence of CD52 using standard immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed with formalin, B-Plus, Zenker's acetic acid, or B5-formalin. The vast majority of low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas) express CD52. In addition, we found that the majority of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express this antigen. In contrast, there is surprising heterogeneity in CD52 expression among more aggressive B cell lymphomas, with 25% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating no detectable CD52. In addition, the majority of neoplasms of the T cell lineage are negative for the antigen, including most cases of precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Finally, the vast majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are negative for CD52 expression.

Valganciclovir prevents cytomegalovirus reactivation in patients receiving alemtuzumab-based therapy.,Blood,Blood,2007-11-26,"Alemtuzumab is an immunosuppressive antibody that depletes normal T cells and B cells. Prophylaxis for herpes virus and Pneumocystis carinii is standard with this agent. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients will experience cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation. We conducted a randomized trial wherein patients being treated with an alemtuzumab-containing regimen received prophylaxis with either valaciclovir 500 mg orally daily or valganciclovir 450 mg orally twice daily. The study design planned to enroll 128 patients, but stopping rules for early termination were met. Forty patients were evaluable. Median age was 58 years (range, 25-83 years); median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10). Diagnoses included chronic lymphocytic leukemia (29), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (3), hairy cell leukemia (1), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (1), marginal zone leukemia (1), large granular lymphocyte leukemia (2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), and T-cell lymphoma (2). Patients received various alemtuzumab-containing regimens, including single agent (5) or combined with: rituximab (2), pentostatin (6), fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (23), or fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) (4).

Predictive value of blood and bone marrow flow cytometry in B-cell lymphoma classification: comparative analysis of flow cytometry and tissue biopsy in 252 patients.,Mayo Clinic proceedings,Mayo Clin. Proc.,2008-07-01,"To study the effectiveness of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCIP) in predicting the histologic B-cell lymphoma type. We studied the FCIP results and tissue histopathology from 252 patients with B-cell lymphoma seen at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, who had positive results on PB, bone marrow, or body fluid FCIP and a corresponding diagnostic tissue biopsy specimen. Most of the B-cell lymphomas studied were low grade, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma being most common. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers. Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and hairy cell leukemia, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis. However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular lymphomas, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas. Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell lymphoma types. However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is

Therapeutic advances in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome over the past 40 years.,Cancer,Cancer,2008-10-01,"Major therapeutic progress has been accomplished in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) over the past 40 years, which may not be fully appreciated by the larger medical community. The objective of this review was to briefly highlight the treatment breakthroughs in leukemia and MDS. Therapeutic progress happened through better understanding of disease pathophysiologies and rational development of targeted agents, like imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and through astute, empirical discoveries in the clinic, like all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and chlorodeoxyadenosine in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Today, the 5- to 10-year survival rates in patients with APL and HCL exceed 80%. In patients with CML, imatinib therapy has been associated with estimated 5- to 7-year survival rates from 85% to 90%. In patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, modern intensive regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates from 20% up to 40%. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemoimmunotherapy recently produced high rates of quality responses and improved long-term outcome. In younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 5-year survival rates range from 40% to 50%, although elderly AML remains a therapeutic challenge.

Hairy cell leukemia.,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,2009-01-01,"Progress in the treatment of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has led to a significant change in the natural history of the disease. With current regimens, the majority of patients achieve a complete remission, and their survival curves are similar to those for appropriate age-matched individuals without the disease. At the same time, new technologies are allowing better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of this and other indolent lymphoid neoplasms. Several studies using modern techniques with different sensitivities have demonstrated the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy with nucleoside analogues in majority of patients.

How I treat hairy cell leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2009-10-20,"The description of hairy cell leukemia as a specific clinical entity was published 50 years ago. The clinical outcome for patients was hampered by ineffective chemotherapy, and splenectomy was the major therapeutic approach to improve peripheral blood counts. The median survival after diagnosis was 4 years. With the introduction of alpha-interferon in 1984, marked improvements in patient responses were observed. Shortly thereafter, the introduction of the purine nucleoside analogs transformed this disease into a highly treatable form of leukemia, and patients with the classic form of this rare leukemia now have a near-normal life expectancy. However, other clinical entities mimicking this disease do not respond; thus, accurate diagnosis is important. Immunophenotypic features in classic hairy cell leukemia show that the leukemic cells express CD11c, CD25, CD103, and CD123 and display bright CD20. Despite the high percentage of durable complete remissions with modern therapy, the long-term disease-free survival curves have not reached a plateau. Many patients who achieve a complete remission by morphologic criteria have minimal residual disease demonstrable by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining, and this population may be at higher risk for earlier relapse.

Modern strategies for hairy cell leukemia.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,J. Clin. Oncol.,2011-01-10,"Enormous progress in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia over the last five decades has emerged as a result of organized clinical investigations. Although interferon represented one of the initial major therapeutic advances in the management of this disease in 1984, the subsequent introduction of purine nucleoside analogs (pentostatin and cladribine) changed the natural history of this rare disease by achieving a high rate of complete and durable remissions. The disease-free survival after effective therapy has not reached a plateau, suggesting control but not cure of the disease. Identification of minimal residual disease in patients achieving a complete hematologic remission provides insight into the potential source for predicting eventual relapse. Modern strategies of targeted therapies directed against immunophenotypic markers on the leukemic cells provide hope that improved long-term control of the disease is possible. Combined chemoimmunotherapy may hold the highest promise for disease eradication, but the optimal strategy for using this approach is under active investigation. Despite the perception by hematologists that this disease has already been conquered, there are critically important unanswered questions that remain.

The microenvironment in hairy cell leukemia: pathways and potential therapeutic targets.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2011-03-25,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells accumulate and proliferate in the spleen and the bone marrow. In these tissue compartments, HCL cells interact with accessory cells, matrix proteins, and various cyctokines, collectively referred to as the 'microenvironment.' Surface receptors expressed on HCL cells and respective stromal ligands are critical for this cross-talk between HCL cells and the microenvironment. Chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules (integrins, CD44), the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), and CD40, expressed on the HCL cells, are likely to be critical for homing, retention, survival, and expansion of the neoplastic B cells. Some of these pathways are now targeted in first clinical trials in other mature B-cell malignancies. We summarize key aspects of the cellular and molecular interactions between HCL cells and their microenvironment.

Hairy cell leukemia: a successful model for experimental therapeutics--pentostatin and new ideas.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2011-06-01,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was once considered an untreatable form of chronic lymphoid malignancy. Based upon the recognition of the importance of adenosine deaminase to the normal B cell survival and proliferation, a hypothesis was developed that temporary inhibition of this enzyme might be therapeutically successful in treating chronic B cell leukemias. Pentostatin was initially explored in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Both pentostatin and cladribine, purine nucleoside analogs, have been utilized to successfully treat HCL. The high degree of complete and durable remission observed with either agent resulted in many believing that the treatment of this rare disease had been fully optimized. However, a considerable number of patients will relapse. While tremendous progress has been made in initial management, the issues related to optimal therapy, timing of initiation of treatment, and discovery of novel agents that may be effective in those who have relapsed are important. Investigational agents currently being explored in chronic lymphocytic leukemia may also have benefit for those patients who have relapsed or are resistant to therapy of hairy cell leukemia.

Hematopoietic stem cell origin of BRAFV600E mutations in hairy cell leukemia.,Science translational medicine,Sci Transl Med,2014-05-01,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by somatic BRAFV600E mutations. The malignant cell in HCL has immunophenotypic features of a mature B cell, but no normal counterpart along the continuum of developing B lymphocytes has been delineated as the cell of origin. We find that the BRAFV600E mutation is present in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in HCL patients, and that these patients exhibit marked alterations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) frequencies. Quantitative sequencing analysis revealed a mean BRAFV600E-mutant allele frequency of 4.97% in HSCs from HCL patients. Moreover, transplantation of BRAFV600E-mutant HSCs from an HCL patient into immunodeficient mice resulted in stable engraftment of BRAFV600E-mutant human hematopoietic cells, revealing the functional self-renewal capacity of HCL HSCs. Consistent with the human genetic data, expression of BRafV600E in murine HSPCs resulted in a lethal hematopoietic disorder characterized by splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased circulating soluble CD25, and increased clonogenic capacity of B lineage cells-all classic features of human HCL. In contrast, restricting expression of BRafV600E to the mature B cell compartment did not result in disease. Treatment of HCL patients with vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutated BRAF, resulted in normalization of HSPC frequencies and increased myeloid and erythroid output from HSPCs. These findings link the pathogenesis of HCL to somatic mutations that arise in HSPCs and further suggest that chronic lymphoid malignancies may be initiated by aberrant HSCs.

Utility of quantitative flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis of CD5 expression in small B-cell neoplasms.,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med.,2014-07-01,"The value of assessing CD5 expression in the differential diagnosis of small B-cell neoplasms is well established. Assessment is usually done qualitatively. To assess CD5 expression levels by quantitative flow cytometry immunophenotyping and to determine possible differences among various small B-cell neoplasms. We performed 4-color flow cytometry analysis on specimens of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and quantified CD5 expression in various small B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. We also assessed CD5 levels in peripheral blood samples of healthy blood donors. Cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma had higher levels of CD5 compared with control B cells (P < .001). Cases of marginal zone lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia had CD5 levels similar to control B cells (P = .35 and P = .14, respectively), whereas cases of follicular lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma had significantly lower CD5 levels than control B cells (P < .001 and P = .04, respectively). In B-cell neoplasms, a high level of CD5 expression was correlated with a homogeneous pattern of positive events, whereas lower CD5 levels were correlated with heterogeneous patterns of positive events. Using flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis to quantify CD5 levels can aid in diagnosis. CD5 expression levels are higher in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, and expression is observed in a homogeneous pattern, as compared with other B-cell neoplasms that are either negative for CD5 or express CD5 at lower levels with a heterogeneous pattern.

Hairy cell leukemia: Update on molecular profiling and therapeutic advances.,Blood reviews,Blood Rev.,2014-07-11,"Hairy cell leukemia was initially described as a clinicopathologic entity more than 50 years ago. We have subsequently discovered that HCL is really at least two diseases: classical HCL and the hairy cell leukemia variant. The former is among a small group of cancers exceptional for being (nearly) unified by a single genetic lesion, the BRAF V600E mutation. Over the past three decades, tremendous progress in both diagnostic and prognostic clarification has been accompanied by therapeutic advances in classical HCL. Consequently, this once uniformly fatal disease has been converted in most cases into a chronic illness enabling patients to live long and productive lives. In response to standard therapy, patients have high complete remission rates. Unfortunately, the long-term survival curves have not plateaued, revealing that this disease is controlled but not cured. Though rare and representing only about 10% of an already rare disease, those patients with the variant fare exceptionally poorly with standard therapy: complete response rates to purine nucleoside analogs are reported to be less than 50%, whereas the complete response rates in classical HCL are up to 90%. Novel small molecules targeting BRAF and the B-cell receptor signaling complex, and biologic agents like antibodies and immunotoxin conjugates are being explored for those patients who have relapsed. Substantial opportunities for continued research remain. This complex and multi-faceted disease incorporates challenges from altered immunity associated with the underlying disease and its treatments. Considering the rarity of this malignancy, optimization of patient management requires multi-institutional collaboration.

Novel therapeutic options for relapsed hairy cell leukemia.,Leukemia & lymphoma,Leuk. Lymphoma,2015-02-04,"The majority of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) achieve a response to therapy with cladribine or pentostatin with or without rituximab. However, late relapses can occur. Treatment of relapsed HCL can be difficult due to a poor tolerance to chemotherapy, increased risk of infections and decreased responsiveness to chemotherapy. The identification of BRAFV600E mutations and the role of aberrant MEK kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathways in the pathogenesis of HCL have helped to develop novel targeted therapies for these patients. Currently, the most promising therapeutic strategies for relapsed or refractory HCL include recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 (e.g. moxetumomab pasudotox), BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and B cell receptor signaling kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib.

"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype distribution, geodemographic patterns, and survival in the US: A longitudinal analysis of the National Cancer Data Base from 1998 to 2011.",American journal of hematology,Am. J. Hematol.,2015-07-27,"The World Health Organization classification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was introduced in 2001. However, its incorporation into clinical practice is not well-described. We studied the distribution of NHL subtypes in adults diagnosed from 1998 to 2011, evaluated time trends, geo-demographic correlates, and changes in 5-year overall survival (OS). We obtained data prospectively collected by the National Cancer Data Base, which covers 70% of US cancer cases. There were 596,476 patients diagnosed with NHL. The major subtypes were diffuse large B-cell (32.5%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; 18.6%), follicular (17.1%), marginal zone (8.3%), mantle cell (4.1%), peripheral T-cell not-otherwise-specified (1.7%), Burkitt (1.6%), hairy cell (1.1%), lymphoplasmacytic (1.1%), and NHL not-otherwise-specified (10.8%). Over the study period, the proportion of NHL not-otherwise-specified declined by half, while marginal zone lymphoma doubled. The distribution of major and rare NHL subtypes varied according to demographics but less so geographically or by type of treatment facility.

Targeting Mutant BRAF in Relapsed or Refractory Hairy-Cell Leukemia.,The New England journal of medicine,N. Engl. J. Med.,2015-09-09,"BRAF V600E is the genetic lesion underlying hairy-cell leukemia. We assessed the safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues. We conducted two phase 2, single-group, multicenter studies of vemurafenib (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily)--one in Italy and one in the United States. The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U.S. study. Primary end points were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall response rate (in the U.S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28 patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36 planned patients) in the U.S. trial. The overall response rates were 96% (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% (9 of 26 patients) and 42% (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6 months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U.S. trial, at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73% and the overall survival rate was 91%. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade 1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism. A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

Initially a uniformly fatal disease, new therapies in rapid succession transformed HCL into a chronic disease with a normal life expectancy in many cases. More recently, the identification of BRAFV600E mutations in the majority of patients with classic HCL have enabled targeted therapies as a therapeutic option. Additional discoveries into the biology of the disease have identified new subtypes of HCL. Modern approaches to the evaluation and treatment of HCL include detailed molecular analysis which informs therapeutic options, which may consist of traditional therapies such as purine nucleoside analogs, or targeted therapies with antibodies, BTK inhibitors, or BRAF inhibitors, or combination therapy.

Chemoimmunotherapy for hairy cell leukemia.,Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,2015-10-08,"Success in the treatment of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) over the last several decades is largely due to the high efficacy of the nucleoside analogs, cladribine and pentostatin. However, the relapse-free survival curves have not shown a plateau and many patients treated with these agents will eventually relapse. Although better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in HCL have led to effective and novel options for the treatment of relapse, long term durability of the responses obtained with these agents still remains unclear.

Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with classic hairy cell leukemia.,Blood,Blood,2016-11-30,"Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematologic malignancy characterized by pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Tremendous progress in the management of patients with this disease has resulted in high response rates and improved survival, yet relapse and an appropriate approach to re-treatment present continuing areas for research. The disease and its effective treatment are associated with immunosuppression. Because more patients are being treated with alternative programs, comparison of results will require general agreement on definitions of response, relapse, and methods of determining minimal residual disease. The development of internationally accepted, reproducible criteria is of paramount importance in evaluating and comparing clinical trials to provide optimal care. Despite the success achieved in managing these patients, continued participation in available clinical trials in the first-line and particularly in the relapse setting is highly recommended. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation convened an international conference to provide common definitions and structure to guide current management. There is substantial opportunity for continued research in this disease. In addition to the importance of optimizing the prevention and management of the serious risk of infection, organized evaluations of minimal residual disease and treatment at relapse offer ample opportunities for clinical research.

Long-Term Outcomes of Hairy Cell Leukemia Treated With Purine Analogs: A Comparison With the General Population.,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,2017-07-14,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare hematologic malignancy with high response rates and long progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with purine nucleoside analogs (PNAs; Pentostatin/Cladribine). However, treatment is not curative, and subsequent treatment at relapse is often required. Rechallenge with a purine analog is commonly implemented despite limited data regarding the efficacy of this approach. We retrospectively analyzed 61 consecutive patients with HCL diagnosed between 1995 and 2013 at Cleveland Clinic. Median follow-up was 72 months (3-193). Cladribine as first-line therapy was administered to 59 patients (97%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 97%, with 78% of patients achieving complete remission (CR). PFS after response was significantly improved for patients who achieved CR compared with those with a partial remission (PR) (5-year PFS 71% vs. 39%, respectively [P = .004]). Of the 19 patients who relapsed, 12 received PNAs as second-line treatment with an ORR (83%) comparable to what these patients had with first-line treatment (ORR 92%). Overall survival of all 61 patients was excellent and superior to that of age-, sex-, and race-matched controls from the general population, possibly due to selection bias. In an analysis of a larger cohort of unselected patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we found that mortality rates for patients with HCL were similar to those of the general population approximately 5 years after diagnosis. These data confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with HCL after first- and second-line PNA therapy.",Comparative Study,921.0,4.0,Hairy cell HCL is a rare hematologic malignancy with high response rates and long progression-free survival PFS after treatment with purine nucleoside analogs PNAs Pentostatin/Cladribine However treatment is not curative and subsequent treatment at relapse is often required Rechallenge with a purine analog is commonly implemented despite limited data regarding the efficacy of this approach We retrospectively analyzed 61 consecutive patients with HCL diagnosed between 1995 and 2013 at Cleveland Clinic Median follow-up was 72 months 3-193 Cladribine as first-line therapy was administered to 59 patients 97 Overall response rate ORR was 97 with 78 of patients achieving complete remission CR PFS after response was significantly improved for patients who achieved CR compared with those with a partial remission PR 5-year PFS 71 vs. 39 respectively P .004 Of the 19 patients who relapsed 12 received PNAs as second-line treatment with an ORR 83 comparable to what these patients had with first-line treatment ORR 92 Overall survival of all 61 patients was excellent and superior to that of age- sex- and race-matched controls from the general population possibly due to selection bias In an analysis of a larger cohort of unselected patients in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database we found that mortality rates for patients with HCL were similar to those of the general population approximately 5 years after diagnosis These data confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with HCL after first- and second-line PNA therapy,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7152, 31, 4623, 16, 8, 622, 813, 710, 5, 64, 51, 151, 2, 319, 91, 115, 25, 300, 50, 24, 5, 5006, 4032, 4063, 41830, 7596, 8251, 137, 24, 16, 44, 1075, 2, 706, 24, 28, 429, 16, 629, 616, 9423, 5, 8, 5006, 3497, 16, 841, 3426, 550, 383, 74, 666, 3, 209, 1, 26, 353, 21, 894, 311, 713, 935, 7, 5, 4623, 265, 59, 2323, 2, 1346, 28, 7317, 1188, 52, 166, 126, 10, 720, 53, 27, 5744, 8251, 22, 157, 328, 36, 10, 468, 6, 728, 7, 1015, 63, 51, 116, 1735, 10, 1015, 5, 833, 1, 7, 1785, 236, 734, 684, 300, 50, 51, 10, 97, 231, 9, 7, 54, 513, 684, 72, 5, 135, 5, 8, 450, 734, 998, 33, 111, 300, 792, 105, 587, 106, 19, 1520, 1, 3, 326, 7, 54, 591, 133, 103, 41830, 22, 419, 328, 24, 5, 35, 1735, 852, 1279, 6, 2067, 46, 7, 42, 5, 157, 328, 24, 1735, 937, 63, 25, 1, 62, 713, 7, 10, 1503, 2, 1123, 6, 17, 1, 89, 1035, 2, 1047, 655, 535, 29, 3, 1083, 266, 2150, 520, 6, 881, 2947, 4, 35, 65, 1, 8, 1077, 180, 1, 3594, 7, 4, 3, 617, 1284, 2, 396, 99, 1605, 609, 21, 204, 17, 282, 151, 9, 7, 5, 4623, 11, 288, 6, 135, 1, 3, 1083, 266, 705, 33, 60, 50, 147, 46, 74, 1843, 3, 1503, 356, 9, 7, 5, 4623, 50, 157, 2, 419, 328, 21470, 36]",1552.0,"['hairy', 'leukemia', 'hcl', 'rare', 'hematologic', 'malignancy', 'high', 'response', 'rate', 'long', 'progression', 'free', 'survival', 'pfs', 'treatment', 'purine', 'nucleoside', 'analog', 'pnas', 'pentostatin', 'cladribine', 'treatment', 'curative', 'subsequent', 'treatment', 'relapse', 'required', 'rechallenge', 'purine', 'analog', 'commonly', 'implemented', 'despite', 'limited', 'efficacy', 'approach', 'retrospectively', 'consecutive', 'patient', 'hcl', 'diagnosed', 'cleveland', 'clinic', 'median', 'follow', 'wa', 'month', 'cladribine', 'line', 'therapy', 'wa', 'administered', 'patient', 'overall', 'response', 'rate', 'orr', 'wa', 'patient', 'achieving', 'complete', 'remission', 'cr', 'pfs', 'response', 'wa', 'significantly', 'improved', 'patient', 'achieved', 'cr', 'compared', 'partial', 'remission', 'pr', 'year', 'pfs', 'respectively', 'patient', 'relapsed', 'received', 'pnas', 'second', 'line', 'treatment', 'orr', 'comparable', 'patient', 'line', 'treatment', 'orr', 'overall', 'survival', 'patient', 'wa', 'excellent', 'superior', 'age', 'sex', 'race', 'matched', 'control', 'general', 'population', 'possibly', 'selection', 'bias', 'larger', 'cohort', 'unselected', 'patient', 'surveillance', 'epidemiology', 'end', 'seer', 'database', 'mortality', 'rate', 'patient', 'hcl', 'similar', 'general', 'population', 'approximately', 'year', 'diagnosis', 'confirm', 'excellent', 'prognosis', 'patient', 'hcl', 'second', 'line', 'pna', 'therapy']",28778620,8,0.14814814814814814
Genomic analysis of hairy cell leukemia identifies novel recurrent genetic alterations.,Blood,Blood,2017-08-11,"Classical hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) is characterized by a near 100% frequency of the <i>BRAF</i>V600E mutation, whereas ∼30% of variant HCLs (vHCLs) have <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations. However, recurrent genetic alterations cooperating with <i>BRAF</i>V600E or <i>MAP2K1</i> mutations in HCL, as well as those in <i>MAP2K1</i> wild-type vHCL, are not well defined. We therefore performed deep targeted mutational and copy number analysis of cHCL (n = 53) and vHCL (n = 8). The most common genetic alteration in cHCL apart from <i>BRAF</i>V600E was heterozygous loss of chromosome 7q, the minimally deleted region of which targeted wild-type <i>BRAF</i>, subdividing cHCL into those hemizygous versus heterozygous for the <i>BRAF</i>V600E mutation. In addition to <i>CDKN1B</i> mutations in cHCL, recurrent inactivating mutations in <i>KMT2C</i> (<i>MLL3</i>) were identified in 15% and 25% of cHCLs and vHCLs, respectively.

Minimal residual hairy cell leukemia eradication with moxetumomab pasudotox: phase 1 results and long-term follow-up.,Blood,Blood,2018-02-27,"Anti-CD22 moxetumomab pasudotox achieved 46% complete remissions (CRs) in previously reported phase 1 testing in relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL; n = 28). The importance of minimal residual disease (MRD) after CR in HCL is unknown. A 21-patient extension cohort received 50 µg/kg every other day for 3 doses in 4-week cycles. These patients plus 12 previously reported at this upper dose level received 143 cycles without dose-limiting toxicity. The combined 33-patient cohort achieved 64% CR and 88% overall response rates, with median CR duration of 42.4 months. Of 32 50-µg/kg patients evaluable for MRD by bone marrow aspirate flow cytometry (most stringent assessment), median CR duration was 13.5 (4.9-42.4) months in 9 MRD-positive CRs vs 42.1 (24.0-69.2) months in 11 MRD-negative CRs (<i>P</i> < .001). Among MRD-negative CRs, 10 patients had ongoing CR, 9 without MRD, at end of study. To our knowledge, moxetumomab pasudotox is the only nonchemotherapy regimen that can eliminate MRD in a significant percentage of HCL patients, to enhance CR duration. Repeated dosing, despite early neutralizing antibodies, increased active drug levels without detectable toxicity from immunogenicity.

Clinicopathologic and molecular features in hairy cell leukemia-variant: single institutional experience.,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",Mod. Pathol.,2018-06-28,"Hairy cell leukemia-variant is rare. Only a small number of cases have been reported in the literature with little cytogenetic or molecular data available. In this study, we describe the clinicopathologic and genetic features of 23 patients with hairy cell leukemia-variant (16 men and 7 women) with a median age of 70 years. Most patients had splenomegaly (90%), leukocytosis (77%), and lymphocytosis (82%); no patients had monocytopenia. Histologically, the bone marrow biopsy specimens showed a mixed pattern of predominantly interstitial and lesser intrasinusoidal infiltration by leukemic cells. In bone marrow aspirate smears most cells had villous cytoplasmic features and a small nucleolus. We describe unusual sites of hairy cell leukemia-variant involvement in 4 patients, including brain, omentum, terminal ileum, and skin at the time of initial presentation. Immunophenotyping showed monotypic B-cells positive for pan B-cell antigens, CD11c, and CD103, and negative for CD25 and annexin A1. Conventional cytogenetic or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed deletions of 17p13/TP53 and 11q22/ATM gene in 5/12 (42%) and 2/9 (22%) cases, respectively. Sequencing of the variable region of IGVH showed mutations (>2% deviation from germline) in 40% of the cases assessed. MAP2K1 mutation (p.C121S) was seen in 1 of 14 (7%) patients tested. No BRAF V600E mutations were detected. The patients were treated in a heterogeneous manner, but most often with therapies designed for classical hairy cell leukemia and the 5-year overall survival was 84%.

Targeting <i>BRAF</i> Mutations in High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Colon.,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,2018-09-01,"Mutations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway leading to constitutive activation and uncontrolled cellular growth have been identified in various human malignancies, making this pathway a target for potential therapeutics. The activating <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation is one well-characterized oncogenic mutation that has been described and targeted with clinical success in various malignancies, including melanoma and hairy cell leukemia. Although <i>BRAF</i>-directed treatments have yielded clinical benefit in a subset of tumor types, such as melanoma, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer, BRAF inhibition fails to confer a clinical benefit in colon cancer. Identification of patients for whom BRAF inhibition may produce clinically meaningful outcomes is imperative. The incidence of <i>BRAF</i> mutations in neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is estimated to be 5% to 10%. A recent case series demonstrated benefit in targeting the <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation in metastatic high-grade rectal NECs. Combination BRAF and MEK inhibition is known to yield improved outcomes compared with BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma. This report presents 2 patients with high-grade colorectal NECs who had different responses to treatment with combined BRAF/MEK inhibition after experiencing disease progression through first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. One patient experienced an excellent initial response to therapy before ultimately experiencing progression, and in the other patient initially had stable disease before eventually experiencing progression.

Atypical presentation of hairy cell leukemia: Significance of CD200 on flow cytometry.,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,J Cancer Res Ther,,"Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, low-grade mature B-cell neoplasm with a characteristic clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and more recently described molecular (BRAF p.V600E mutation) profile. It typically affects middle-aged to elderly male who present with pancytopenia and massive splenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy is usually not seen. Atypical presentations such as absence of splenomegaly and presence of lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis, a hypoplastic marrow masquerading as aplastic anemia, pose a diagnostic challenge to both clinician and pathologist. A diligent morphological examination to look for the presence of hairy cells along with flow cytometric immunophenotyping showing consistent bright expression of CD200, in addition to well-described characteristic immunophenotype, helps in correctly diagnosing the case. This can be further confirmed by the consistent presence of V600E point mutation in BRAF gene. The correct identification of HCL in these unusual clinical presentations is of utmost importance owing to a different treatment approach in these cases. We present here four such cases with atypical presentation.",Letter,,1.0,Hairy cell HCL is a rare low-grade mature B-cell neoplasm with a characteristic clinical morphological immunophenotypic and more recently described molecular BRAF p.V600E mutation profile It typically affects middle-aged to elderly male who present with pancytopenia and massive splenomegaly Lymphadenopathy is usually not seen Atypical presentations such as absence of splenomegaly and presence of lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis a hypoplastic marrow masquerading as aplastic anemia pose a diagnostic challenge to both clinician and pathologist A diligent morphological examination to look for the presence of hairy cells along with flow cytometric immunophenotyping showing consistent bright expression of CD200 in addition to well-described characteristic immunophenotype helps in correctly diagnosing the case This can be further confirmed by the consistent presence of V600E point mutation in BRAF gene The correct identification of HCL in these unusual clinical presentations is of utmost importance owing to a different treatment approach in these cases We present here four such cases with atypical presentation,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"[7152, 31, 4623, 16, 8, 622, 154, 88, 2908, 132, 31, 2131, 5, 8, 2037, 38, 4268, 6599, 2, 80, 761, 1027, 219, 566, 19, 2047, 258, 800, 192, 1969, 2561, 3897, 1032, 6, 1216, 1045, 54, 364, 5, 15154, 2, 7929, 6364, 4962, 16, 2082, 44, 527, 1973, 4261, 225, 22, 1127, 1, 6364, 2, 463, 1, 4962, 2, 7463, 8, 44451, 581, 73536, 22, 16315, 1545, 6015, 8, 752, 1745, 6, 110, 3744, 2, 5093, 8, 27953, 4268, 1385, 6, 5316, 9, 3, 463, 1, 7152, 37, 1510, 5, 1412, 6226, 9416, 2069, 925, 9676, 55, 1, 20730, 4, 352, 6, 149, 1027, 2037, 5496, 6484, 4, 4911, 5798, 3, 473, 26, 122, 40, 195, 557, 20, 3, 925, 463, 1, 2047, 741, 258, 4, 566, 145, 3, 4883, 911, 1, 4623, 4, 46, 4015, 38, 4261, 16, 1, 17882, 1187, 3421, 6, 8, 338, 24, 353, 4, 46, 140, 21, 364, 467, 294, 225, 140, 5, 1973, 1031]",1120.0,"['hairy', 'leukemia', 'hcl', 'rare', 'low', 'grade', 'mature', 'neoplasm', 'characteristic', 'clinical', 'morphological', 'recently', 'described', 'molecular', 'braf', 'profile', 'typically', 'affect', 'middle', 'aged', 'elderly', 'male', 'present', 'pancytopenia', 'massive', 'splenomegaly', 'lymphadenopathy', 'usually', 'seen', 'atypical', 'presentation', 'absence', 'splenomegaly', 'presence', 'lymphadenopathy', 'leukocytosis', 'hypoplastic', 'marrow', 'masquerading', 'aplastic', 'anemia', 'pose', 'diagnostic', 'challenge', 'clinician', 'pathologist', 'diligent', 'morphological', 'examination', 'look', 'presence', 'hairy', 'flow', 'cytometric', 'showing', 'consistent', 'bright', 'expression', 'cd', 'addition', 'described', 'characteristic', 'immunophenotype', 'help', 'correctly', 'diagnosing', 'case', 'confirmed', 'consistent', 'presence', 'point', 'braf', 'correct', 'identification', 'hcl', 'unusual', 'clinical', 'presentation', 'utmost', 'importance', 'owing', 'different', 'treatment', 'approach', 'case', 'present', 'case', 'atypical', 'presentation']",30197362,2,0.037037037037037035
